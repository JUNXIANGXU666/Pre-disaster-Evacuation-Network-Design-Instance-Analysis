J	Chen, Q; Shi, F				Chen, Qun; Shi, Feng			Model for Microcirculation Transportation Network Design	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												The idea of microcirculation transportation was proposed to shunt heavy traffic on arterial roads through branch roads. The optimization model for designing micro-circulation transportation network was developed to pick out branch roads as traffic-shunting channels and determine their required capacity, trying to minimize the total reconstruction expense and land occupancy subject to saturation and reconstruction space constraints, while accounting for the route choice behaviour of network users. Since micro-circulation transportation network design problem includes both discrete and continuous variables, a discretization method was developed to convert two groups of variables (discrete variables and continuous variables) into one group of new discrete variables, transforming the mixed network design problem into a new kind of discrete network design problem with multiple values. The genetic algorithm was proposed to solve the new discrete network design problem. Finally a numerical example demonstrated the efficiency of the model and algorithm.

A delay-partitioning group strategy is proposed and impulse-quantizing control is designed to derive theoretical criteria ensuring scale-type synchronization of complex networks. Our results show that synchronization of mixed continuous-discrete complex networks can be realized by controlling delay-partitioning subgroup nodes with impulsive quantization.

Global optimization method for mixed transportation network design problem: A mixed-integer linear programming approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												This paper proposes a global optimization algorithm for solving a mixed (continuous/discrete) transportation network design problem (MNDP), which is generally expressed as a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraint (MPEC). The upper level of the MNDP aims to optimize the network performance via both expansion of existing links and addition of new candidate links, whereas the lower level is a traditional Wardrop user equilibrium CUE) problem. In this paper, we first formulate the UE condition as a variational inequality (VI) problem, which is defined from a finite number of extreme points of a link-low feasible region. The MNDP is approximated as a piecewise-linear programming (P-LP) problem, which is then transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. A global optimization algorithm based on a cutting constraint method is developed for solving the MILP problem.

In this study, to find the global optimum design efficiently, holographic neural network is introduced to be an activate function of response surface methodology to find the most probable optimal design. Since the accuracy of approximation function near the global optimal design is merely important, techniques to search the region of containing the global optimal design most in probability sense by using conditional random seeds, and techniques for finding more accurate approximation near the most probable global optimal design are exploited. The proposed approach called most probable optimal design (MPOD) method is employed to pick up one local optimum design which has the biggest probability in the design space. Design example of crash worthiness for the passenger injury with mixed continuous and discrete design variables are shown the validity of the method.																					7-5606-0796-9				1999							461	468																WOS:000177767800061

Depending on whether the demand adaptive service is operated along circular or radial transit lines, two variants of such systems are considered: a Circular Model (or C-Model) and a Radial Model (or R-Model). A continuous approximation approach is employed to develop the optimal design problem, which is formulated as a mixed integer program. A comprehensive numerical experiment is performed to compare various cost components corresponding to the optimal design of the two systems, and a discrete-event simulation is developed to validate the analysis.

Economic or technical uncertain factors may have a strong influence on the behavior of a distribution system and should be taken into account in the design process. These factors can affect to the construction and operating costs, origin or destination of the supplied commodities, required demands or arc capacities. In this paper, some of these uncertain parameters are supposed to be continuous while others are clearly discrete in nature, giving rise to a mixed integer set of scenarios under which the system may be assessed. We explore how to design a robust distribution network when the uncertainty in the continuous parameters is modeled through polyhedral sets combined with other sources of uncertainty for the discrete parameters. The corresponding optimization problem is solved using a Benders decomposition framework. Finally, a computational experiment with specialized solvers is carried out in order to test the efficiency of our algorithms.

J	Liu, XY; Chen, Q				Liu, Xinyu; Chen, Qun			An Algorithm for the Mixed Transportation Network Design Problem	PLOS ONE												This paper proposes an optimization algorithm, the dimension-down iterative algorithm (DDIA), for solving a mixed transportation network design problem (MNDP), which is generally expressed as a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraint (MPEC). The upper level of the MNDP aims to optimize the network performance via both the expansion of the existing links and the addition of new candidate links, whereas the lower level is a traditionalWardrop user equilibrium (UE) problem. The idea of the proposed solution algorithm (DDIA) is to reduce the dimensions of the problem. A group of variables (discrete/continuous) is fixed to optimize another group of variables (continuous/discrete) alternately; then, the problem is transformed into solving a series of CNDPs (continuous network design problems) and DNDPs (discrete network design problems) repeatedly until the problem converges to the optimal solution. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is that its solution process is very simple and easy to apply. Numerical examples show that for the MNDP without budget constraint, the optimal solution can be found within a few iterations with DDIA. For the MNDP with budget constraint, however, the result depends on the selection of initial values, which leads to different optimal solutions (i.e., different local optimal solutions). Some thoughts are given on how to derive meaningful initial values, such as by considering the budgets of new and reconstruction projects separately.

J	Li, M; Lin, X; Chen, XQ				Li, Meng; Lin, Xi; Chen, Xi-qun			A surrogate-based optimization algorithm for network design problems	FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING												Network design problems (NDPs) have long been regarded as one of the most challenging problems in the field of transportation planning due to the intrinsic non-convexity of their bi-level programming form. Furthermore, a mixture of continuous/discrete decision variables makes the mixed network design problem (MNDP) more complicated and difficult to solve. We adopt a surrogate-based optimization (SBO) framework to solve three featured categories of NDPs (continuous, discrete, and mixed-integer). We prove that the method is asymptotically completely convergent when solving continuous NDPs, guaranteeing a global optimum with probability one through an indefinitely long run. To demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed framework, numerical examples are provided to compare SBO with some existing solving algorithms and other heuristics in the literature for NDP. The results show that SBO is one of the best algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, and it is efficient for solving large-scale problems with more than 20 decision variables. The SBO approach presented in this paper is a general algorithm of solving other optimization problems in the transportation field.					yang, yijing/JWO-8234-2024; lin, xi/GZL-4959-2022; zhen, wang/KBA-3844-2024; Chen, Xiqun (Michael)/D-9847-2015	Chen, Xiqun (Michael)/0000-0001-8285-084X													2095-9184	2095-9230				NOV	2017	18	11					1693	1704		10.1631/FITEE.1601403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1631/FITEE.1601403													WOS:000422941600002

However, facilities in real world are always vulnerable to partial or complete disruptions. Owing to this reason, we firstly formulate the supply chain network design problem under disruption scenarios as a mixed-integer nonlinear program which maximises the total profit for the whole system. After that, in order to obtain near-optimal solutions with reasonable computational requirements for large problem instances, we have proposed a novel artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for solving this problem. Unlike other continuous optimisation problems, the supply chain network design problem under disruption scenarios is a classical discrete NP-hard one. Therefore, the proposed ABC algorithm applies discrete operators to generate new neighbouring food sources for the employed bees, onlookers and scouts. Subsequently, the computational simulations reveal very promising results in terms of the quality of solution.																			0952-8091	1741-5047					2013	47	2-3					289	296		10.1504/IJCAT.2013.054361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJCAT.2013.054361													WOS:000422495200019

The pump location variables in previous papers were typically discrete, resulting in potentially sub-optimal solutions. If the discrete variables are densified, the solving time increases substantially. To overcome the shortcomings of the discrete pump location optimization method, a novel continuous location optimization method is proposed. The hydraulic calculations of pipes and operation of pumps are coupled in the model to make it practical. The objective function minimizes the installation and operating costs of pumps. A branch and a looped water pipe network are studied. The proposed continuous location optimization method is compared with the previous discrete method. The results show that the proposed method has advantages regarding cost-minimization and it reduces the time required to produce solutions. The method is generic and can be applied to other real cases to determine the optimal pump locations to achieve the goals of cost-minimization and energy saving.

Our proposal results in an analog network topology for implementing general continuous-time discrete-space mixed-domain 3-D rational transfer functions for linear filtering. The network connections correspond one-to-one to the transfer function coefficients. The mixed-domain frequency response is treated as a temporal frequency-dependent spatial function and we show how nonseparable properties of the spatio-temporal magnitude response can be derived from the combination of: 1) sinusoidal functions of spatial frequencies and 2) polynomials of the continuous-time frequency in the 3-D frequency response expression. A generic VLSI-compatible implementation of the network based on continuous-time integrators is also proposed.

Commercial RO systems are composed of several numbers of RO passes with auxiliary equipment such as high-pressure pumps and pressure-exchanger units to facilitate the separation, and to deliver clean water. Available design models for the RO network represent mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulations. In addition, the existing RO design MINLP models are static in nature. These models are not suitable for RO network design under time-variant constraints. In this study, a multiperiod MINLP model is detailed for the RO network design. High-level design decision variables are related to the RO network configuration and equipment sizing, which are independent of time. These decisions are modeled by discrete and continuous variables. Low-level time-variant decision variables are related to the RO network operation and modeled by continuous variables. The operation decision variables are constrained by the design variables through different time periods to satisfy water-demand constraints. In addition, several correlations are considered in this study to estimate water and RO transport properties during the separation process.

J	Hu, Z; Mahadevan, S				Hu, Zhen; Mahadevan, Sankaran			Bayesian Network Learning for Data-Driven Design	ASCE-ASME JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS PART B-MECHANICAL ENGINEERING												Bayesian networks (BNs) are being studied in recent years for system diagnosis, reliability analysis, and design of complex engineered systems. In several practical applications, BNs need to be learned from available data before being used for design or other purposes. Current BN learning algorithms are mainly developed for networks with only discrete variables. Engineering design problems often consist of both discrete and continuous variables. This paper develops a framework to handle continuous variables in BN learning by integrating learning algorithms of discrete BNs with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We first make the topology learning more robust by optimizing the number of Gaussian components in the univariate GMMs currently available in the literature. Based on the BN topology learning, a new multivariate Gaussian mixture (MGM) strategy is developed to improve the accuracy of conditional probability learning in the BN. A method is proposed to address this difficulty of MGM modeling with data of mixed discrete and continuous variables by mapping the data for discrete variables into data for a standard normal variable. The proposed framework is capable of learning BNs without discretizing the continuous variables or making assumptions about their conditional probability densities (CPDs). The applications of the learned BN to uncertainty quantification and model calibration are also investigated. The results of a mathematical example and an engineering application example demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.																			2332-9017	2332-9025				DEC	2018	4	4							041002	10.1115/1.4039149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4039149													WOS:000448247000002
J	Blommaert, M; Wack, Y; Baelmans, M				Blommaert, Maarten; Wack, Y.; Baelmans, M.			An adjoint optimization approach for the topological design of large-scale district heating networks based on nonlinear models	APPLIED ENERGY												This article deals with the problem of finding the best topology, pipe diameter choices, and operation parameters for realistic district heating networks. Present design tools that employ non-linear flow and heat transport models for topological design are limited to small heating networks with up to 20 potential consumers. We introduce an alternative adjoint-based numerical optimization strategy to enable large-scale nonlinear thermal network optimization. In order to avoid a strong computational cost scaling with the network size, we aggregate consumer constraints with a constraint aggregation strategy. Moreover, to align this continuous optimization strategy with the discrete nature of topology optimization and pipe size choices, we present a numerical continuation strategy that gradually forces the design variables towards discrete design choices. As such, optimal network topology and pipe sizes are determined simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the algorithm by designing a fictitious district heating network with 160 consumers. As a proof-of-concept, the network is optimized for minimal investment cost and pumping power, while keeping the heat supplied to the consumers within a thermal comfort range of 5%. Starting from a uniform distribution of 15 cm wide piping throughout the network, the novel algorithm finds a network layout that reduces piping investment by 23% and pump-related costs by a factor of 14 in less than an hour on a standard laptop. Moreover, the importance of embedding the non-linear transport model is clear from a temperature-induced variation in the consumer flow rates of 72%.

Both evolutionary algorithms (EA) and gradient-based mathematical optimization approaches are investigated for the solution of the resulting large-scale non-linear (NLP) and bi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programs (BOMINLP). While EAs have been successfully applied to solve discrete network design problems for large-scale WDNs, gradientbased mathematical optimization methods are more computationally efficient when dealing with large search spaces associated with continuous variables in optimal network control problems. Considering the advantages of each method, we propose a sequential hybrid method for the optimal design-for-control of large-scale WDNs, where a refinement stage relying on gradient-based mathematical optimization is used to solve continuous optimal control problems corresponding to design solutions returned by an initial EA search. The proposed method is applied to compute the Pareto front of a bi-objective design-for-control problem for the operational network BWPnet, where we consider reopening closed connections between isolated supply areas. The results show that the considered design-for-control strategy increases the resilience of BWPnet while minimizing pressure induced leakage. Moreover, the refinement stage of the proposed hybrid method efficiently improves the coarse approximation computed by the initial EA search, returning a continuous and even Pareto front approximation.

J	Shen, SQ; Chen, ZH				Shen, Siqian; Chen, Zhihao			Optimization models for differentiating quality of service levels in probabilistic network capacity design problems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												This paper develops various chance-constrained models for optimizing the probabilistic network design problem (PNDP), where we differentiate the quality of service (QoS) and measure the related network performance under uncertain demand. The upper level problem of PNDP designs continuous/discrete link capacities shared by multi-commodity flows, and the lower level problem differentiates the corresponding QoS for demand satisfaction, to prioritize customers and/or commodities. We consider PNDP variants that have either fixed flows (formulated at the upper level) or recourse flows (at the lower level) according to different applications. We transform each probabilistic model into a mixed-integer program, and derive polynomial-time algorithms for special cases with single-row chance constraints. The paper formulates benchmark stochastic programming models by either enforcing to meet all demand or penalizing unmet demand via a linear penalty function. We compare different models and approaches by testing randomly generated network instances and an instance built on the Sioux-Falls network. Numerical results demonstrate the computational efficacy of the solution approaches and derive managerial insights. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The variables involved in the problem are discrete (link topology, routes for freight vehicles) and continuous (link capacity in term of signal settings). The discrete variables are related to the link direction, lane numbers, lane use and sequence of retailers reached by the vehicles. The continuous variables, assuming that the link capacity is a function of the characteristics of the final node in the link, are related to the regulations at the intersection. The NVROP is, hence, formulated as a mixed (discrete/continuous) problem in a congested network. A heuristic procedure is used both to find the best network configuration and the best vehicle route.

J	Zhao, WQ; Beach, TH; Rezgui, Y				Zhao, Wanqing; Beach, Thomas H.; Rezgui, Yacine			A systematic mixed-integer differential evolution approach for water network operational optimization	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												The operational management of potable water distribution networks presents a great challenge to water utilities, as reflected by the complex interplay of a wide range of multidimensional and nonlinear factors across the water value chain including the network physical structure and characteristics, operational requirements, water consumption profiles and the structure of energy tariffs. Nevertheless, both continuous and discrete actuation variables can be involved in governing the water network, which makes optimizing such networks a mixed-integer and highly constrained decision-making problem. As such, there is a need to situate the problem holistically, factoring in multidimensional considerations, with a goal of minimizing water operational costs. This paper, therefore, proposes a systematic optimization methodology for (near) real-time operation of water networks, where the operational strategy can be dynamically updated using a model-based predictive control scheme with little human intervention. The hydraulic model of the network of interest is thereby integrated and successively simulated with different trial strategies as part of the optimization process. A novel adapted mixed-integer differential evolution (DE) algorithm is particularly designed to deal with the discrete-continuous actuation variables involved in the network. Simulation results on a pilot water network confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and the superiority of the proposed mixed-integer DE in comparison with genetic algorithms. It also suggests that 23.69% cost savings can be achieved compared with the water utility's current operational strategy, if adaptive pricing is adopted for all the pumping stations.

Tabular data usually contains a mix of discrete and continuous columns. Continuous columns may have multiple modes whereas discrete columns are sometimes imbalanced making the modeling difficult. Existing statistical and deep neural network models fail to properly model this type of data. We design CTGAN, which uses a conditional generator to address these challenges. To aid in a fair and thorough comparison, we design a benchmark with 7 simulated and 8 real datasets and several Bayesian network baselines.

Secondly, we derive several mild algebra conditions to guarantee that the discussed discrete-time system is the global exponential stability in Lyapunov sense. It is shown analytically that the discrete-time technique is able to maintain the uniqueness of equilibrium point and its dynamic behavior of the continuous-time model under the same conditions.

The population is separated into two groups: discrete and continuous variables. The discrete variables are optimized by the adapted PSO, while the continuous variables are optimized by the GA-SQP using the discrete variable information from the adapted PSO. Therefore, the population can be set to a smaller size than usual to obtain a global solution.

In several practical applications, BNs need to be learned from available data before being used for design or other purposes. Current' BN learning algorithms are mainly developed for networks with only discrete variables. Engineering design problems often consist of both discrete and continuous variables. This paper develops a framework to handle continuous variables in BN learning by integrating learning algorithms of discrete BNs with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We first make the topology learning more robust by optimizing the number of Gaussian components in the univariate GMMs currently available in the literature. Based on the BN topology learning, a new Multivariate Gaussian Mixture (MGM) strategy is developed to improve the accuracy of conditional probability learning in the BN. A method is proposed to address this difficulty of MGM modeling with data of mixed discrete and continuous variables by mapping the data for discrete variables into data for a standard normal variable. The proposed framework is capable of learning BNs without discretizing the continuous variables or making assumptions about their CPDs. The applications of the learned BN to uncertainty quantification and model calibration are also investigated. The results of a mathematical example and an engineering application example demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.																			2159-7383		978-0-7918-5812-7				2017									V02AT03A044															WOS:000423243800044

Extended Discrete-Time Resource Task Network Formulation for the Reactive Scheduling of a Mixed Batch/Continuous Process	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed for the optimal reactive scheduling of a mixed batch/continuous process, based on the discrete time resource task network (RTN) representation and extensions. The scheduling task is complicated with the mixed process units and network structure, as well as operation rules such as product changeovers. The extended RTN model introduces modifications to the conventional RTN models such as multiextent resource balances and, also, adds more features such as resource limit balances and resource slacks. These extensions allow for efficient modeling of the mixed plant in great detail. The extended RTN model is further reformulated to the state space form by incorporating lifted state variables that represent task histories. The state space RTN model facilitates reactive schedule design, particularly when used with the rolling horizon scheme. In the case study, we show the advantages of the state space RTN model in periodic rescheduling under process disruptions.

In the proposed inertial models, a type of mixed delays is introduced which is composed of discrete delays and infinite distributed delays. Particulary, the finite distributed delays can be easily obtained by selecting specific kernel functions in infinite distribute delays. To realize exponential synchronization, different from the previous continuous designs for the first-order systems obtained by suitable substitutions of reduced-order, an intermittent control scheme is directly developed for the response inertial systems. Furthermore, a direct analysis method is proposed to derive the synchronization conditions by constructing a Lyapunov functional formed by the state variables and their derivatives.

At the same time, care should be taken not to affect communication quality and network lifetime. This paper studies a joint optimization algorithm for transmitted power and channel allocation based on deep reinforcement learning. First, an optimization model to measure network reward was established under the constraint of the signal-to-interference plus-noise-ratio (SINR) threshold, which includes continuous power variables and discrete channel variables. Secondly, considering the dynamic changes of agricultural WSNs, the network control is described as a Markov decision process with continuous state and action space. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning scheme suitable for mixed variables was designed. This method could obtain a control scheme that maximizes network reward by means of black-box optimization for continuous transmitted power and discrete channel allocation. Experimental results indicated that the studied algorithm has stable convergence. Compared with traditional protocols, it can better control the transmitted power and allocate channels. The joint power and channel optimization provides a reference solution for constructing an energy-balanced network.																				2227-9717				NOV	2021	9	11							1919	10.3390/pr9111919	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr9111919													WOS:000726651700001

The mixed time-delays that consist of both the discrete time-varying and distributed time-delays with a given range are presented. The activation functions are assumed to be globally Lipschitz continuous. By using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to construct sufficient conditions for the existence of admissible state estimator such that the error-state system is exponentially globally stable. To avoid complex mathematical derivations and conservative results, a new hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm method is integrated with a LMI method to seek the estimator gains that satisfy the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional stability inequalities. The proposed new approach is straightforward and well adapted to the computer implementation. Therefore, the computational complexity can be reduced remarkably and facilitate the design task of the estimator for T-S fuzzy neural networks with time-varying interval delays. Two illustrative examples are exploited in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed state estimator.																			1370-4621	1573-773X				AUG	2012	36	1					49	67		10.1007/s11063-012-9222-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-012-9222-4													WOS:000305961900004

While most of the research regarding latent variables revolves around accounting for their presence and learning how they interact with other variables in the experiment, their bare existence is assumed to be deduced based on domain expertise. In this work we focus on the discovery of such latent variables, utilizing statistical hypothesis testing methods and Bayesian Networks learning. Specifically, we present a novel method for detecting discrete latent factors which affect continuous observed outcomes, in mixed discrete/continuous observed data, and device a structure learning algorithm that adds the detected latent factors to a fully observed Bayesian Network. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method with a set of experiments, in both controlled and real-life settings, one of which is a prediction for the outcome of COVID-19 test results.																					978-1-6654-4337-1				2021							248	255		10.1109/ICMLA52953.2021.00046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA52953.2021.00046													WOS:000779208200038
J	Yang, GQ; Liu, YK				Yang, Guoqing; Liu, Yankui			Designing fuzzy supply chain network problem by mean-risk optimization method	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING												In many practical supply chain network design (SCND) problems, the critical parameters such as customer demands, transportation costs and resource capacities are quite uncertain. The significance of uncertainty motivates us to develop a new mean-risk fuzzy optimization method for SCND problem, in which the standard semivariance is suggested to gauge the risk resulted from fuzzy uncertainty. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed optimization method, we define a new concept about the value of fuzzy solution for our SCND problem. When the transportation costs and the demands of customers have continuous possibility distributions, we approximate the continuous fuzzy vector by a sequence of discrete fuzzy vectors. On the basis of the approximation scheme, we obtain an approximating optimization model, which is a nonlinear mixed-integer programming problem. Furthermore, we design a hybrid memetic algorithm (MA) to solve the approximating optimization problem. The designed hybrid MA incorporates the reduced variable neighborhood search to act as the local search procedure. Finally, we conduct some numerical experiments via an application example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed hybrid MA.

J	Yuan, B; Tao, J				Yuan, Bo; Tao, Jun			A research study on methods for improving the service quality of a network system based on time information	DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES												The network delay is one of the important criteria for selecting computing and networking capabilities. Network delay is one of the important bases of computing network selection. With the continuous development and integration of digital technology, communication technology, and control theory, the research on control theory for networked systems has rapidly advanced. This study proposes an event-triggered mixed time-delay neural network (NN) synchronization method, aiming to reduce network transmission delays through the optimization of NNs, thereby enhancing service responsiveness or reducing errors in data transmission. Firstly, a discrete-driven NN model subject to mixed time delays is established, and the corresponding response network is constructed. In the design of the synchronization controller, a quadratic function is constructed based on the measurement of error states, serving as a threshold for designing the event-trigger mechanism. For the synchronization error system, by constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional dependent on time delays and a general mu -function, analytical techniques and matrix theory are applied to obtain sufficient criteria for the mu -stability. The validity of the theoretical findings is proven through numerical examples. For neural networks with hybrid time delay, an event triggering mechanism based on hybrid threshold function is proposed. Unlike the vast majority of existing literature, this paper provides a stability analysis of event-triggered hybrid delayed neural network mu -synchronization based on event triggering. The proposed scheme is validated by numerical simulation.																				3004-9261				JAN 29	2024	6	2							38	10.1007/s42452-024-05649-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-024-05649-z													WOS:001207458200002

To address the complex optimization challenges in the design of large-scale hydrogen storage pipeline networks, the study introduces a mixed integer nonlinear optimization model inspired by hydrogen pipeline design optimization theory. The model not only focuses on optimizing network design parameters but also aims to minimize investment costs. To achieve this, the study proposes an innovative hybrid genetic algorithm that combines the Modified Feasible Directions Method (MFDM) and Genetic Algorithm Theory (GAT), specifically targeting the optimization of pipeline diameter ' s discrete distribution challenges. Comparative analyses with SUMT and GA algorithms demonstrate the superiority of the approach. In continuous space, the algorithm achieves a lower convergence cost of 232.4437 x 10 4 Yuan, while in discrete space, the cost further decreases to 212.1636 x 10 4 Yuan. Additionally, the study delves into the sensitivity of the HGA-MFDM algorithm to ambient temperature and wellhead temperature in hydrogen storage facilities. The analysis reveals that wellhead temperature has a more significant impact on pipeline network investment, whereas ambient temperature exhibits a more pronounced effect on iteration curves. The findings provide valuable insights for the precise adjustment and optimization of hydrogen storage pipeline networks in practical applications.																			0360-3199	1879-3487				MAY 13	2024	66						430	444		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.098													WOS:001229692600001

The problem involves both discrete variables, modeling the structure of a flow network, and continuous variables, modeling flow rates, and stream attributes. The continuous relaxation of this mixed integer nonlinear programming problem is nonconvex because of the presence of bilinear terms in the constraint functions. We propose an algorithm to find the global solution using the principles of the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A novel piecewise linear RLT formulation is proposed and applied to the class of generalized pooling problems.

To support the GTs' throughput while guaranteeing the quality-of-service for the D2D users, the paper proposes the joint design of D2D assignment, bandwidth, and power allocation. This design task poses a computationally challenging mixed-binary optimization problem, for which a new computational method for its solution is developed. Multiple binary (discrete) constraints for the D2D assignment are equivalently expressed by continuous constraints to leverage systematic processes of continuous optimization. As a result, this problem of mixed-binary optimization is reformulated by an exactly penalized continuous optimization problem, for which an alternating descent algorithm is proposed. Each round of the algorithm invokes two simple convex optimization problems of low computational complexity. The theoretical convergence of the algorithm can be easily proved and the provided numerical results demonstrate its rapid convergence to an optimal solution. Such a cognitive network is even more desirable as it outperforms a non-cognitive network, which uses a partial bandwidth for D2D users only.					Duong, Trung Q./AAI-6804-2020; Poor, H.

J	Chen, XQ; Zhu, Z; He, X; Zhang, L				Chen, Xiqun (Michael); Zhu, Zheng; He, Xiang; Zhang, Lei			Surrogate-Based Optimization for Solving a Mixed Integer Network Design Problem	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												This paper considers the bilevel mixed network design problem (MNDP) used in dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) and the simulation-based optimization solution. The upper level of the bilevel MNDP minimizes the network cost in terms of average travel time by the expansion of existing links and the addition of new candidate links. The lower level is a dynamic user-optimal condition that can be formulated as a variational inequality problem. The MNDP simultaneously finds optimal capacity expansions of existing links and new link additions. A surrogate-based optimization (SBO) framework is proposed for solving the MNDP that is characterized by expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. Because simulation was applied to evaluate those objective functions, additional complexity arose from the fine-grained representation of traffic dynamics in large-scale networks, which were not fully considered by the traditional static user equilibrium. SBO methods enjoy both the advantages of simulation in time-varying network performance evaluation and the efficiency of mathematical optimization. To be more specific, SBO produces computational time savings by exploring the input output mapping surface in a more systematic and efficient way. For demonstrative purposes, a case study was conducted on the large-scale Montgomery County network in Maryland. In this example, a mesoscopic simulation-based DTA model, DTALite, was used to evaluate the system performance in response to various network design strategies. Results showed that the optimal investment with a moderate budget could reduce 17.73% of the network average travel time in the morning peak. The proposed framework is a general approach, which is ready for application to either continuous or discrete network design problems.					chen, yanhong/JVE-0289-2024; Chen, Xiqun (Michael)/D-9847-2015	Chen, Xiqun (Michael)/0000-0001-8285-084X													0361-1981	2169-4052					2015		2497					124	134		10.3141/2497-13	http://dx.doi.org/10.3141/2497-13													WOS:000369469000013

Because of particular characteristics and technology constraints of the SCC plant, traditional robust scheduling often provides an excessively conservative solution. This paper proposes an effective proactive scheduling that utilizes robustness adopting a distribution curve of a system performance created as a mix-integer model. The proposed robustness is designed to work effectively with the existing factory operation and is based on uncertainty assessment. In this paper, artificial neural network (ANN) is adopted with a challenge of designing an accurate model due to the model complexity from the discrete and nonlinear properties of the system performance. The ANN model is achieved by applying k-mean clustering, which decomposes machines to smaller groups having similar effect to the uncertainty. A case study based on data from a real SCC plant is conducted to demonstrate the methodology. The experimental result shows that the proposed methodology is successful in designing a robust schedule that provides a lower production cost under an acceptable breakdown probability while also consuming less computational time compared with the traditional approach.																			0217-5959	1793-7019				APR	2015	32	2							1550010	10.1142/S0217595915500104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217595915500104													WOS:000352146400010

Disjunctive-Genetic Programming Approach to Synthesis of Process Networks	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												In this work, disjunctive-genetic programming (D-GP), based on the integration of genetic algorithm (GA) with the disjunctive formulations of generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) for the optimization of process networks, has been proposed. Discrete optimization problems, which give rise to the conditional modeling of equations through representations as logic based disjunctions, are very important and often appear in all scales of chemical engineering process network design and synthesis. The decomposition of the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem obtained from the relaxation of the disjunctive formulation of the original problem results in alternating solutions of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) master problems and nonlinear programming (NLP) subproblems. With the increase in the problem scale, dealing with such alternating routes becomes difficult due to increased computational load and possible entanglement of the results in suboptimal solutions due to infeasibilities in the MILP space. In this work, the genetic algorithm (GA) has been used as a jumping operator to the different terms of the discrete search space and for the generation of different feasible fixed configurations. This proposed approach eliminates the need for the reformulation of the discrete/discontinuous optimization problems into direct MINLP problems, thus allowing for the solution of the original problem as a continuous optimization problem but only at each individual discrete and reduced search space. Segment-based mutation (SBM) and segment-based floating crossover (SBFC) strategies were proposed for the efficient handling of the population of chromosomes comprising the coded terms of the disjunctions. The effectiveness of D-GP as shown on various benchmark problems involving heat exchange equipment design and network problems as well as a classical process network problem shows this maybe a promising approach in dealing with process network problems with large discontinuous objective and/or constraint functions.

The sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT) was applied to construct the GHN for dealing with the design constraints. An additional penalty function for dealing with the discrete and integer variables was then imposed on the formulation of SUMT to construct an energy function of GHN for formulating the neuron-like dynamical system. The numerical solution process for such a dynamic system is simply solving a set of simultaneous first-order ordinary differential equations (ODE) that is the main feature of this optimization method. The experimental examples showed the presenting strategy is reliable. The suitable values or the adaptation technique for some parameters in computation was discussed in the paper. The presenting strategy indeed provides an alternative way of handling the engineering optimization dynamically and expands the usage of ODE. An asymmetrical three-bar truss design, a reinforced concrete beam design and a 10-bar structural design are contributed to illustrate the presenting neuron-like network method.

For this purpose, Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) have been shown to be effective for mapping regions of interest in the design space, even when those regions of interest exhibit complex topologies. However, identifying sets of desirable solutions can be difficult with a BNC when attempting to map a space where high-performance designs are spread sparsely among a disproportionately large number of low-performance designs, resulting in an imbalanced classifier. In this paper, a method is presented that utilizes probabilities of class membership for known training points, combined with interpolation between those points, to generate synthetic high-performance points in a design space. By adding synthetic design points into the BNC training set, a designer can rebalance an imbalanced classifier and improve classification accuracy throughout the space. For demonstration, this approach is applied to an acoustics metamaterial design problem with a sparse design space characterized by a combination of discrete and continuous design variables.

A novel state estimator is presented to estimate the network states. A new event-triggered transmission scheme is proposed to reduce unnecessary network traffic between the sensors and the estimator, where the sampled data is transmitted to the estimator only when the so-called "event-triggered condition" is satisfied. The purpose of the problem addressed is to design an estimator for the complex network such that the estimation error is ultimately bounded in mean square. By utilizing Lyapunov theory combined with the stochastic analysis approach, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the estimation error in mean square. Then, the desired estimator gain matrices are obtained via solving a convex problem. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.

This paper addresses some of the issues arising from the use of sensor networks in control applications. Classical control theory proves to be insufficient in modeling distributed control problems where issues of communication delay, jitter and time synchronization between components are not negligible. After discussing our hardware and software platform and our target application, we review useful models of computation and then suggest a mixed model for design, analysis, and synthesis of control algorithms within sensor networks.

In the first place, a flexible schedule model combining the merits of discrete and Continuous time formulations is introduced to integrate batch production and WAN. Then, two novel state-time-space (STS) Superstructures incorporating all basic elements (i.e., states, tasks, equipment, and time) are adopted to capture all production schemes and batch WAN configurations. Specifically, by adding novel components in the original Superstructure, a series of optimal network structures with multistage splitting and mixing options which have never been contained within previous superstructure can be easily generated. Finally, a reliable optimization strategy, where deterministic and stochastic searching techniques are combined, is Suggested to deal with the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model.

The augmented lagrange multiplier (ALM) method was applied to transform a constrained problem to an unconstrained formulation. A penalty function approach was then imposed on the ALM formulation to construct an energy function for formulating the neuron-like dynamical system. The numerical solution process for such a dynamic system is nothing but solving simultaneously first-order ordinary differential equations. The experimental examples showed the presenting strategy is efficient and reliable. The suitable values or the adaptation technique for some parameters in computation was discussed in the paper. The presenting strategy extends the practical limits in numerical optimization method and engineering design.																					7-5606-0796-9				1999							233	240																WOS:000177767800031

In particular, we investigate the pace of infection in overpopulated systems. In order to do that, we design a model for epidemic spreading on a finite complex network with a restriction to at most one contamination per time step, which can serve as a model for sexually transmitted diseases spreading in some student communes. Because of the highly discrete character of the process, the analysis cannot use the continuous approximation widely exploited for most models. Using a discrete approach, we investigate the epidemic threshold and the quasi-stationary distribution. The main results are two theorems about the mixing time for the process: it scales like the logarithm of the network size and it is proportional to the inverse of the distance from the epidemic threshold.

The structure is widely applied to square, circular, or elliptical oil and gas fields with many wells, stations, and large areas. Accordingly, it is of great practical significance to carry out research on the optimization of such a gathering and transportation network because the reasonable pipeline network structure can significantly reduce the pipeline network investment and improve the system operation reliability. This paper establishes a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model with the minimum total cost as the objective function. A step-by-step optimization strategy is proposed to classify SARGPNO into two subproblems: well group division optimization (WGDO) and ring structure optimization (RSO). These two subproblems are solved by hybrid genetic algorithm combined with local optimization of the mountain-climbing algorithm. In order to investigate the influence of algorithm parameters on the optimization results, such as crossover probability, mutation probability, the number of evolutionary generations, and initial population size, a real gas field was employed and analyzed. The results of pipeline network layout under different gathering radii and different well constraints were determined. Besides, considering the convenience of the construction site, the optimization design under discrete space was conducted. Then the optimized layout in discrete space was compared with the layout designed in continuous space. Furthermore, the optimization results of the pipeline network considering the obstacle constraints were also analyzed by using the gas field data from the literature. Finally, two examples were adopted to verify the validity and feasibility of the model and algorithm.

Although various considerations such as non-isothermal mixing and bypass streams are applied to consider real world alternatives in modeling phase, many challenges are faced because of its properties within non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We propose a modified superstructure, which contains a utility substage for use in considering multiple utilities in a simultaneous MINLP model. To improve model size and convergence, fixed utility locations according to temperature and series connections between utilities are suggested. The numbers of constraints, discrete, and continuous variables show that overall model size decreases compared with previous research. Thus, it is possible to expand the feasible search area for reaching the nearest global solution. The model's effectiveness and applications are exemplified by several literature problems, where it is used to deduce a network superior to that of any other reported methodology.

One of the main challenges in the analysis is that agents are only allowed to exchange one-bit messages, and the information at each agent therefore consists of both continuous and discrete components. Due to this mixed nature, the steady-state distribution of the state of each agent cannot be inferred from direct application of central limit arguments. Instead, the behavior of the continuous component is characterized in integral form by using a log-characteristic function, while the behavior of the discrete component is characterized by means of an asymmetric Bernoulli convolution. By exploiting these results, this paper derives reliable approximate performance expressions for the network nodes that match well with the simulated results for a wide range of system parameters. The results also reveal an important interplay between continuous adaptation under constant step-size learning and the binary nature of the messages exchanged with neighbors.

This article develops a mixed switching event-triggered (SET) transmission scheme by interpreting the resultant closed-loop system as a switching between systems under time-trigger, self-trigger, and discrete event-trigger with a dynamical threshold. For stability analysis, a novel looped-functional is constructed by introducing additional integrals. An asymptotic stability criterion is further derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. For direct comparison between different transmission schemes, we also demonstrate the criterion by applying it to systems under time-trigger, discrete SET, SET, discrete ET, and continuous ET. The looped-functional is then employed to the robust stabilization of the systems with transmission delays and external disturbance. Finally, numerical simulations corroborate that the proposed MSET leads to (often considerably) fewer transmissions than other schemes.

J	Propato, M				Propato, Marco			Contamination warning in water networks: General mixed-integer linear models for sensor location design	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												A mixed-integer linear program is proposed to identify optimal sensor locations for early warning against accidental and intentional contaminations in drinking water distribution systems. The general model can be applied to unsteady hydraulic conditions. Furthermore, it may accommodate different design objectives whose problem formulations vary only by the cost function coefficients while decision variables and linear constraints remain identical. Such a feature is very important since several requirements may be factors for practical design of warning systems. Linear constraint matrix properties show that the solution may often be found at the root (no branching). If not, a procedure is proposed to identify a significant set of discrete decision variables. whose integrality constraints can be always relaxed. This result is coupled with good data preprocessing to minimize auxiliary continuous variables and constraints, allowing for efficient computation and increasing model applicability to large problems. The methodology is illustrated on a small and a midsize network.																			0733-9496	1943-5452				JUL-AUG	2006	132	4					225	233		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(2006)132:4(225)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(2006)132:4(225)													WOS:000238430100004

Sensing, computation and actuation are combined thus involving a set of highly heterogeneous components, i.e., digital and analog hardware, software, energy sources, and external environment. Moreover, the growing use of networks contributes to introduce a further level of heterogeneity. All these aspects should be taken into account in the design process to find highly optimized solutions; therefore a Cyber-Physical System approach is needed. In particular, simulation is a key technique in the different design stages. However, the heterogeneity of components, together with the presence of the network, forces to adopt complex and slow co-simulation techniques to carry on the simulation of the entire system. This work aims at proposing SystemC as unified framework to model and simulate Networked Cyber-Physical Systems. Concerning the modeling of continuous-time components and a specific class of discrete-time components, the different Models of Computation provided by the Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) extension of SystemC are used. Regarding the network, SystemC and the SystemC Network Simulation Library are used to model communications at different abstraction levels.

J	Su, TL; Longo, S; Herrmann, G; Barber, P				Su, Tingli; Longo, Stefano; Herrmann, Guido; Barber, Phil			Computation of an optimal communication schedule in a nonlinear networked control system using sum-of-squares	SYSTEMS & CONTROL LETTERS												In this paper, we consider the design of a control optimal communication schedule in nonlinear networked control with nonlinear affine plant systems. We focus here on periodic communication schedules in control systems with time-triggered control communication and assume the existence of predesigned controllers which need to be optimally integrated via the control communication system. For this, we formulate a quadratic cost function for the nonlinear affine plant. The system and the cost are first discretized using an exact mixed discretization approach which allows to lift the problem from the continuous-discrete domain into a purely discrete-time representation. Periodicity due to the fixed communication schedule is dealt with the discrete lifting technique. To allow for the computation of the cost, nonlinearities are approximated in terms of a Taylor series which allows the use of the sum-of-squares framework. Once a cost function of the networked control system for a given fixed communication schedule is defined, it is then possible to compare and choose those sequences that minimize this cost for optimal controller integration.

Blackboxes are intended to be run in the forward direction. This article presents a new method of solving the "inverse design problem," namely, given requirements or constraints on output, find an input that also optimizes an objective function. This problem is challenging for several reasons. First, blackboxes are not designed to be run in reverse. Second, inputs and outputs can be discrete and continuous. Third, finding designs concurrently satisfying a set of requirements is hard because designs satisfying individual requirements may conflict with each other. Fourth, blackbox evaluations can be expensive. Finally, evaluations can sometimes fail to produce an output due to nonconvergence of underlying numerical algorithms. This article presents CNMA, a new method of solving the inverse problem that overcomes these challenges. CNMA tries to sample only the part of the design space relevant to solving the inverse problem, leveraging the power of neural networks, mixed-integer linear programs, and a new learning-from-failure feedback loop. This article also presents a parallel version of CNMA that improves the efficiency and quality of solutions over the sequential version and tries to steer it away from local optima. CNMA's performance is evaluated against conventional optimization methods for seven nonlinear design problems of 8 (two problems), 10, 15, 36 and 60 real-valued dimensions and one with 186 binary dimensions. Conventional methods evaluated are stable, off-the-shelf implementations of the Bayesian optimization with the Gaussian Processes, Nelder-Mead, and Random Search. The first two do not even produce a solution for problems that are high dimensional, having both discrete and continuous variables or whose blackboxes fail to return values for some inputs. CNMA produces solutions for all problems. When conventional methods do produce solutions, CNMA improves upon their performance by 1%-87%.

In this paper, we systematically explore the effects of various transmission power control strategies on WSN lifetime with an emphasis on discretization of power levels and strategies for transmission power assignment. We investigate the effects of the granularity of power levels on energy dissipation characteristics through a linear programming framework by modifying a well known and heavily utilized continuous transmission power model (HCB model). We also investigate various transmission power assignment strategies by using two sets of experimental data on Mica motes. A novel family of mathematical programming models are developed to analyze the performance of these strategies. Bandwidth requirements of the proposed transmission power assignment strategies are also investigated. Numerical analysis of our models are performed to characterize the effects of various design parameters and to compare the relative performance of transmission power assignment strategies. Our results show that the granularity of discrete energy consumption has a profound impact on WSN lifetime, furthermore, more fine-grained control of transmission power (i.e., link level control) can extend network lifetime up to 20% in comparison to optimally-assigned network-level single transmission power.					tavli, bulent/AEN-2252-2022; Uzun, Erkam/Z-4191-2019; Tavli, Bulent/AAG-9523-2020	tavli, bulent/0000-0002-9615-1983; Uzun, Erkam/0000-0001-5185-7723; Tavli, Bulent/0000-0002-9615-1983; Bicakci, Kemal/0000-0002-2378-8027													0018-9340	1557-9956				NOV	2014	63	11					2866	2879		10.1109/TC.2013.151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.151													WOS:000343887700018

After detailed analysis, we come up with an intermittent quantized control for the concerned bi-directional associative memory neural network. By designing an elaborate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, we prove under certain additional conditions that the controlled network is stochastically synchronizable in finite time: The 1st moment of every trajectory of the error network system associated to the concerned controlled network tends to zero as time approaches a finite instant (the settling time) which is given explicitly, and remains to be zero constantly thereupon. In the meantime, we present a numerical example to illustrate that the synchronization control designed in this paper is indeed effective. Since the concerned fuzzy network includes Markovian jumping and several types of delays simultaneously, and it can be synchronized in finite time by our suggested control, as well as the suggested intermittent control is quantized which could reduce significantly the control cost, the theoretical results in this paper are rich in mathematical implication and have wide potential applicability in the real world.

Optimal sizing, scheduling and shift policy of the grinding section of a ceramic tile plant	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												This paper addresses the optimal design of the grinding section of a ceramic tile plant operating in a cyclic mode with the units (mills) following a batch sequence. The optimal design problem of this single product plant is formulated with a fixed time horizon of one week, corresponding to one cycle of production, and using a discrete-time resource task network (RTN) process representation. The size of the individual units is restricted to discrete values, and the plant operates with a set of limited resources (workforce and equipment). The goal is to determine the optimal number and size of the mills to install in the grinding section, the corresponding production schedule, and shift policy. This problem involves labor/semi-labor intensive (LI/SLI) units with a depreciation cost of the same order as that of the operation cost. The optimal design of the grinding section comprises the trade-off between these two costs. The resulting optimization formulation is of the form of a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, solved using a branch and bound solver (CPLEX 9.0.2). The optimal solution is analyzed for various ceramic tile productions and different shift policies.

Caching and multicasting at macro and pico base stations (BSs) are two promising methods to support massive content delivery and reduce backhaul load in HetNets. In this paper, we jointly consider caching and multicasting in a large-scale cache-enabled HetNet with backhaul constraints. We propose a hybrid caching design to provide high spatial file diversity and a corresponding multicasting design for efficient content dissemination. By carefully handling different types of interferers, we derive tractable expressions for the successful transmission probability in the general signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) and user density region as well as the high SNR and user density region, utilizing tools from stochastic geometry. Then, we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing the design parameters, which is a very challenging mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. By exploring the structural properties, we obtain a near optimal solution with superior performance and manageable (polynomial) complexity, based on a two-step optimization framework. The analysis and optimization results provide valuable design insights for practical cache-enabled HetNets.

DESIGN OF CONTROLLER FOR MIXED DATA TYPE - A COMPOSITE FUZZY-NEURAL APPROACH	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Input feature vectors in feed-forward neural network are generally processed by linear separation through plane or hyperplane. But discrete features are difficult to feed into these nonlinear computational processing elements. Even if the processing is carried out using some encoding mechanisms of quantization, retaining information of the original categorical variables appears to be difficult at times. This paper proposes a methodology to design an online controller through fuzzification of the discrete input features first and, then through supervised learning based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Continuous feature spaces are processed simultaneously through multi-layered perceptrons (MLP) and both the systems are connected through a linear filter for prediction of response variables using log-likelihood cost function. This proposed architecture has been tested on standard data set for its efficacy. The system is proven to be more efficient as compared to the existing methods in terms of error metrics. The estimation is independent of the number of discrete input features and in case if the data set has several categorical features, this method will still be more effective than the available systems.																				1823-4690				DEC	2014	9				SI		1	11																WOS:000214303200001
J	Wu, QQ; Zhang, R				Wu, Qingqing; Zhang, Rui			Beamforming Optimization for Wireless Network Aided by Intelligent Reflecting Surface With Discrete Phase Shifts	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS												Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a cost-effective solution for achieving high spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless networks by leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts. Prior works on IRS mainly consider continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult to implement due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this paper an IRS-aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a given set of minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in general. To tackle this problem, we first study the single-user case with one user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal algorithms for solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting elements, while a constant proportional power loss is incurred that depends only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs for the single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users among which some are aided by the IRS. Simulation results verify our performance analysis as well as the effectiveness of our proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.

The features of FCGNNs, discrete time delays, distributed delays and discontinuous activations are taken into account which makes our networks more general and practical in comparison with the most existing Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Two switching state-feedback controllers designed for the implement of finite-time synchronization can be used to effectively overcome the limitations of the traditional continuous linear feedback controllers. Different from previous work, graph theory and Lyapunov method are used to study finite-time synchronization of FCGNNs for the first time in this paper, then some sufficient criteria are obtained to guarantee the finite-time synchronization of FCGNNs. In particular, it is worth noting that the settling time for finite-time synchronization is closely related to the topological structure of FCNNs. Finally, two numerical examples are given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results.

We introduce cost risk level constraint and joint service level constraint in the proposed optimization model. When the random parameters follow normal distributions, we reduce the risk level constraint and the joint service level constraint into their equivalent credibility constraints. Furthermore, we employ a sequence of discrete possibility distributions to approximate continuous possibility distributions. To enhance solution efficiency, we introduce the dominance set and efficient valid inequalities into deterministic mixed-integer programming (MIP) model, and preprocess the valid inequalities to obtain a simplified nonlinear programming model. After that, a hybrid biogeography based optimization (BBO) algorithm incorporating new solution presentation and local search operations is designed to solve the simplified optimization model. Finally, we conduct some numerical experiments via an application example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed hybrid BBO. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dorfman, KD; Brenner, H				Dorfman, KD; Brenner, H			Generalized Taylor-Aris dispersion in discrete spatially periodic networks: Microfluidic applications	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												A theory is presented for the lumped parameter, convective-diffusive transport of individual, noninteracting Brownian solute particles ("macromolecules") moving within spatially periodic, solvent-filled networks-the latter representing models of chip-based microfluidic chromatographic separation devices, as well as porous media. Using graph-theoretical techniques, the composite medium is conceptually decomposed into a network of channels (the edges) through which the solute is transported by a combination of molecular diffusion and either "piggyback" entrainment within a flowing solvent or an externally applied force field acting upon the solute molecules. A probabilistic choice of egress channel for a solute particle exiting the intersection (vertex) of the channels is furnished by an imperfect mixing model. A spatially periodic, Taylor-Aris-like "method-of-moments" scheme is applied to this transport model, leading to discrete matrix equations for computing the network-scale particle velocity vector (U) over bar* and dispersivity dyadic (U) over bar* in terms of the prescribed microscale transport parameters and network geometry characterizing the basic unit cell of which the spatially periodic device is comprised. The ensuing algebraic equations governing the vertex-based, discrete unit-cell "fields" P-0(infinity)(i) and B(i) (i = 1.2,..., n), whose paradigmatic summations yield (U) over bar* and (D) over bar*, constitute discrete analogs of classical continuous macrotransport phenomenological parameters. P-0(infinity)(r) and B(r), with r a continuous position vector defined within the unit cell. The ease with which these discrete calculations can be pet-formed for complex networks renders feasible parametric studies of potential microfluidic chip designs, particularly those pertinent to biomolecular separation schemes. Application of this discrete theory to the dispersion analysis of pressure-driven flow in spatially periodic serpentine microchannels is shown to accord with existing results previously derived using classical continuous macrotransport theory.

Current MADC methods mostly transform mixed-attributedata into discrete-attribute data or continuous-attribute data before classification algorithms are trained. Thediscretization of continuous-attribute data usually results in information loss, while the binarization of discrete-attribute data generally yield more discrete-attributes. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novelMADC method abbreviated as DO-RVFL-NBC, which is a Dependency-Oriented aggregation model of randomvector functional link (RVFL) network and naive Bayes classifier (NBC). First, the method transforms theoriginal mixed-attribute set into a dependent attribute set and an independent attribute set by consideringthe variation rates of dependence and independence, respectively. Second, a RVFL network is trained basedon the dependent attribute set where each attribute has a weight to represent its dependence importancedegree. Third, a weighted NBC is constructed by assigning the independence importance degrees as weightsfor the calculation of class-conditional probability. Finally, exhaustive experiments are conducted to validatethe feasibility, rationality, and effectiveness of the DO-RVFL-NBC method using 22 benchmark mixed-attributedata sets. Experimental results show that (1) dependence and independence exist in the original mixed-attributeset and can be effectively explored; (2) changes of attribute dependences can improve the generalizationcapabilities of the RVFL network and NBC; and (3) a statistical analysis indicates that DO-RVFL-NBC canobtain considerably better testing accuracies on the benchmark mixed-attribute data sets in comparison with13 other MADC methods.

Design of a motorcycle frame using neuroacceleration strategies in MOEAs	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS					13th Biennial Latin-Ibero-American Conference on Operations Research	NOV 27-30, 2006	Montevideo, URUGUAY	Univ Republic Uruguay, Operat Res Dept, Comp Sci Inst Engn Fac				Designing a low-budget lightweight motorcycle frame with superior dynamic and mechanical properties is a complex engineering problem. This complexity is due in part to the presence of multiple design objectives-mass, structural stress and rigidity-, the high computational cost of the finite element (FE) simulations used to evaluate the objectives, and the nature of the design variables in the frame's geometry (discrete and continuous). Therefore, this paper presents a neuroacceleration strategy for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) based on the combined use of real (FE simulations) and approximate fitness function evaluations. The proposed approach accelerates convergence to the Pareto optimal front (POF) comprised of nondominated frame designs. The proposed MOEA uses a mixed genotype to encode discrete and continuous design variables, and a set of genetic operators applied according to the type of variable. The results show that the proposed neuro-accelerated MOEAs, NN-NSGA II and NN-MicroGA, improve upon the performance of their original counterparts, NSGA II and MicroGA. Thus, this neuroacceleration strategy is shown to be effective and probably applicable to other FE-based engineering design problems.

J	D'Andreagiovanni, F; Mannino, C; Sassano, A				D'Andreagiovanni, Fabio; Mannino, Carlo; Sassano, Antonio			GUB Covers and Power-Indexed Formulations for Wireless Network Design	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												W e propose a pure 0-1 formulation for the wireless network design problem, i.e., the problem of configuring a set of transmitters to provide service coverage to a set of receivers. In contrast with classical mixed-integer formulations, where power emissions are represented by continuous variables, we consider only a finite set of power values. This has two major advantages: it better fits the usual practice and eliminates the sources of numerical problems that heavily affect continuous models. A crucial ingredient of our approach is an effective basic formulation for the single knapsack problem representing the coverage condition of a receiver. This formulation is based on the generalized upper bound (GUB) cover inequalities introduced by Wolsey [Wolsey L (1990) Valid inequalities for 0-1 knapsacks and mips with generalised upper bound constraints. Discrete Appl. Math. 29(2-3):251-261]; and its core is an extension of the exact formulation of the GUB knapsack polytope with two GUB constraints. This special case corresponds to the very common practical situation where only one major interferer is present. We assess the effectiveness of our formulation by comprehensive computational results over realistic instances of two typical technologies, namely, WiMAX and DVB-T.

Many chemical engineering optimization problems, such as process design and synthesis, rely on simulations and contain both discrete and continuous decision variables. Surrogate-based optimization with continuous variables has been studied extensively; however, there are many open challenges for the case of mixed-variable inputs. In this work, we propose an algorithm for mixed-integer nonlinear simulation-based problems that uses adaptive sampling and surrogate modeling with one-hot encoding. We propose techniques for the design of experiments for mixed-variable problems, surrogate modeling for mixed-variable response surfaces, and iterative approximation-optimization procedure that leads to optimal solutions. Results show that one-hot encoding leads to accurate and robust mixed-variable Gaussian Process and Neural Network models that are effective surrogates for optimization. The proposed algorithm is tested on mixed-integer nonlinear benchmark problems and a chemical process synthesis case study. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Networked explicit hybrid predictive control of an industrial benchmark process	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING												Hybrid systems have acquired deep attention in research as many systems in industries and laboratories manifest hybrid dynamic behaviors. Optimal control design for hybrid systems exhibits challenges for controlling the interacting continuous and discrete dynamics. A double-tank hybrid system (DTHS) is proposed in this paper with a mixed-integer actuation mechanism. The proposed DTHS aims to control the liquid level of the two tanks simultaneously by a networked hybrid predictive controller. Hybrid frameworks are provided to investigate the system through reachability analysis. An explicit hybrid model predictive control (EHMPC) has been developed to control the levels of the DTHS. Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation is performed for assessing the performance of the EHMPC with a hardware real-time networked controller. The networked real-time controller is constructed and implemented using the Node.js frameworks. The simulation and realtime results are presented and discussed to evaluate the hybrid controller performance.

Areas of application include integrated design and control, synthesis of reactor networks, reduction of kinetic mechanisms and optimization of hybrid systems. This article presents new formulations and algorithms for solving MIDO problems. The algorithms are based on decomposition into primal, dynamic optimization and master, mixed-integer linear programming sub-problems. They do not depend on the use of a particular primal dynamic optimization method and they do not require the solution of an intermediate adjoint problem for constructing the master problem, even when the integer variables appear explicitly in the differential-algebraic equation system.

J	Shin, J; Park, K; Kang, DK				Shin, Jiyong; Park, Kyongseok; Kang, Dae-Ki			TA-DARTS: Temperature Annealing of Discrete Operator Distribution for Effective Differential Architecture Search	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												In the realm of machine learning, the optimization of hyperparameters and the design of neural architectures entail laborious and time-intensive endeavors. To address these challenges, considerable research effort has been directed towards Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), with a focus on enhancing these inherent inefficiencies. A pivotal facet of this pursuit is Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a domain dedicated to the automated formulation of neural network architectures. Given the pronounced impact of network architecture on neural network performance, NAS techniques strive to identify architectures that can manifest optimal performance outcomes. A prominent algorithm in this area is Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), which transforms discrete search spaces into continuous counterparts using gradient-based methodologies, thereby surpassing prior NAS methodologies. Notwithstanding DARTS' achievements, a discrepancy between discrete and continuously encoded architectures persists. To ameliorate this disparity, we propose TA-DARTS in this study-a temperature annealing technique applied to the Softmax function, utilized for encoding the continuous search space. By leveraging temperature values, architectural weights are judiciously adjusted to alleviate biases in the search process or to align resulting architectures more closely with discrete values. Our findings exhibit advancements over the original DARTS methodology, evidenced by a 0.07%p enhancement in validation accuracy and a 0.16%p improvement in test accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset. Through systematic experimentation on benchmark datasets, we establish the superiority of TA-DARTS over the original mixed operator, thereby underscoring its efficacy in automating neural architecture design.																				2076-3417				SEP	2023	13	18							10138	10.3390/app131810138	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app131810138													WOS:001145094000001

Explicitly, we propose the joint design of the multi-user (MU) beamformers and the RIS's PREs for quality-of-service target in terms of the individual users' rates. In the face of dispersive channels, we demonstrate that this poses a large-scale mixed discrete continuous optimization problem of intractable nature. We then tackle this challenge by developing low-complexity iterative procedures, which invoke light-weight closed-form expressions at each iteration, are developed for its computational solution.

Furthermore, the controller design respects the structure of the equations so that we can characterize the stabilization by a limited controller action.

For a Ricean model of the fading communication channel, it is shown that the resulting system has a hybrid structure including the continuous-time dynamics of the networked systems and a discrete-time dynamics of the communication channels. Moreover, this resulting hybrid system has both multiplicative and additive noise terms. The performance analysis naturally leads to an H-2/H-infinity-type norm evaluation for systems with finite jumps and multiplicative noise. It is proved that this norm depends on the stabilizing solution of a specific system of coupled Riccati's equations with jumps. A state-feedback design problem to accomplish a mixed H-2/H-infinity performance is also considered. A numerical iterative procedure allowing to compute the stabilizing solution of the Riccati-type system with jumps is presented. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical results concerning the tracking performances of a flight formation with fading communication channel. The paper ends with some concluding remarks.

By introducing pinch analysis concepts, the improved PSO method has shown excellent performance in the optimality of reuse water network synthesis based on the minimization of freshwater flow rate, number of interconnections and annual total cost.

The jumping parameters are modeled as a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. The nonlinear perturbation of the measurement equation are assumed to be locally Lipschitzian. By introducing triple-integral terms, the Lyapunov matrices in the Lyapunov functional are distinct for different system modes as many as possible. Based on the nonsmooth analysis theory and stochastic analysis techniques, a full-order state estimator is designed to make the corresponding error system exponentially stable in mean square. The desired mode-dependent and delay-dependent estimator can be achieved by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Fast Design Space Exploration of Nonlinear Systems: Part II	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS												Nonlinear system design is often a multiobjective optimization problem involving the search for a design that satisfies a number of predefined constraints. The design space is typically very large since it includes all possible system architectures with different combinations of components composing each architecture. In this article, we address nonlinear system design space exploration through a two-step approach encapsulated in a framework called fast design space exploration of nonlinear systems (ASSENT). In the first step, we use a genetic algorithm to search for system architectures that allow discrete choices for component values or else only component values for a fixed architecture. This step yields a coarse design since the system may or may not meet the target specifications. In contrast to prior works on design space exploration that rely on forward design, we use an inverse design in step 2 to search over a continuous space and fine-tune the component values with the goal of improving the value of the objective function. We use a neural network (NN) to model the system response. The NN is converted into a mixed-integer linear program for active learning to sample component values efficiently. We illustrate the efficacy of ASSENT on problems ranging from nonlinear system design to the design of electrical circuits. Experimental results show that ASSENT achieves the same or better value of the objective function compared to various other optimization techniques for nonlinear system design by up to 53 %. We improve sample efficiency by 6-12x compared to reinforcement learning-based synthesis of electrical circuits.

A Novel Continuous-Time Modeling and Optimization Framework for Well Platform Planning Problems	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING												The long-term planning problem for integrated gas field development is investigated. The key decisions involve both design of the production and transportation network structure and operation of the gas fields over time. A novel continuous-time modeling and optimization approach is proposed, which introduces the concept of event points and allows the well platforms to come online at potentially any time within the continuous horizon under consideration. A two-level formulation and solution framework is developed to take into account complicated economic calculations and results in mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. As compared with the discrete-time model, the proposed approach leads to more compact mathematical models and significant reduction of the size of the resulting MINLP problems. Even though, the proposed approach in its current form cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution, computational results show that this approach can reduce the computational efforts required substantially and solve problems that are intractable for the discrete-time model.																			1389-4420	1573-2924				JUN	2003	4	1-2			SI		65	95		10.1023/A:1021860330145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021860330145													WOS:000208096300004

Processes associated with WSS include design, planning, maintenance, control, management, rehabilitation, enlargement, etc. Modeling and simulation of these processes can be performed by using a number of variables and constraints that are non-negative in nature. Demands, diameters of pipes, flowrates, minimum pressure at demand nodes, volume of reservoirs, are only a few examples, taken from the purely technical context. In this paper we will focus on the design of WSS. This a mixed discrete-continuous constrained optimization problem that is addressed here by the use of an evolutionary technique based on swarm intelligence.

The leader decides which road in the network is maintained in which period and the follower, as in the Discrete Network Design Problem, optimizes its own path through the network. The non-linear bilevel problem is first linearized and then transformed into a single-level mixed-integer program by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This model is solved with Benders Decomposition. The numerical study shows that this method finds better solutions faster compared to solving the mixed-integer formulation directly and using a genetic algorithm.

The aim is to propose joint designs of beamforming and remote radio head (RRH)user association, subject to constraints on users' quality-of-service, limited capacity of fronthaul links and transmit power, to maximize the system energy efficiency. To cope with the limited-capacity fronthaul we consider the problem of RRH-user association to select a subset of users that can be served by each RRH. Moreover, different to the conventional power consumption models, we take into account the dependence of the baseband signal processing power on the data rate, as well as the dynamics of the efficiency of power amplifiers. The considered problem leads to a mixed binary integer program which is difficult to solve. Our first contribution is to derive a globally optimal solution for the considered problem by customizing a discrete branch-reduce-and-bound approach. Since the global optimization method requires a high computational effort, we further propose two suboptimal solutions able to achieve the near optimal performance but with much reduced complexity. To this end, we transform the design problem into continuous (but inherently nonconvex) programs by two approaches: penalty and L-0-approximation methods. These resulting continuous nonconvex problems are then solved by the successive convex approximation framework. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Caching and multicasting at macro and pico base stations (BSs) are two promising methods to support massive content delivery and reduce backhaul load in HetNets. In this paper, we jointly consider caching and multicasting in a large-scale cache-enabled HetNet with backhaul constraints. We propose a hybrid caching design consisting of identical caching in the macro-tier and random caching in the pico-tier, and a corresponding multicasting design. By carefully handling different types of interferers and adopting appropriate approximations, we derive tractable expressions for the successful transmission probability in the general signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and user density region as well as the high SNR and user density region, utilizing tools from stochastic geometry. Then, we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing design parameters, which is a very challenging mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. By exploring structural properties, we obtain a near optimal solution with superior performance and manageable complexity. This solution achieves better performance in the general region than any asymptotically optimal solution, under a mild condition.

MXene was an appealing candidate in endowing polymeric guidance conduits with electrical conductivity, yet its superiority was extremely constrained by its discrete distribution, incapable forming contiguous conduction channels in matrix. Herein, an efficient conductive nerve guidance conduit with three-dimensional continuous conductive network structure was constructed by prior powder design and laser additive manufacturing. Specifically, MXene was coated on poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) particle surface by ultrasonic-assisted solution mixing and thus MXene was enriched at interfacial regions among adjacent polymer particles to form continuous MXene conductive network. More ingeniously, benefiting from the unique shearing-free and confined-flowing forming characteristic of laser additive manufacturing, not only network structure was retained as well as MXene contact became more tightly, which provided a continuous channel for rapid charge transfer. Results demonstrated that the conduits with 3.5 vol% MXene exhibited a continuous conductive network structure, resulting in an excellent electrical conductivity of 4.53 S/m, which was in appropriate conductive range of nerve growth (1-10 S/m). Cell evaluation confirmed the conduits significantly promoted cell proliferation, differential and neurite outgrowth. Therefore, this work not only illustrated the feasibility of additive manufacturing in constructing conduits with three-dimensional continuous conductive network structure, but also created a powerful strategy for fabricating desirable conductive nerve guidance conduits.

Under this architecture, we investigate how to jointly make offloading link selection and bandwidth allocation decisions for BSs and IoT users. Considering the differentiated decision-making time granularities, we formulate a two-timescale stochastic optimization problem to minimize the overall task offloading delay. To accommodate the two-timescale network dynamics and characterize state-action relations, we establish a hierarchical Markov decision process (H-MDP) framework with two separate agents tackling two-timescale network management decisions, and two evolved MDP-based subproblems are formulated accordingly. To efficiently solve the subproblems, we further develop a hybrid proximal policy optimization (H-PPO)-based algorithm. Specifically, a hybrid actor-critic architecture is designed to deal with the mixed discrete and continuous actions. In addition, an action mask layer and an action shaping function are designed to sample feasible task offloading decisions from the time-variant action set. Extensive simulation results have validated the superiority of the proposed ISTN architecture and the H-PPO-based algorithm, especially, in scenarios with scarce spectrum resources and heavy traffic loads.

Joint strength is the key property in evaluating the capability of the adhesive joint. In this paper, developments of black-box and grey-box machine learning (ML) models are presented to allow accurate predictions of the failure load of single lap joints by considering a mix of continuous and discrete design (geometry and material) variables. Firstly, the failure loads of 300 single lap joint samples with different geometry/material parameters are calculated by FE models to generate a data set of which accuracy is validated by experimental results. Then, a deep neuron network (blackbox) and a genetic programming (grey-box) model are developed for accurately predicting the failure load of the joint. Based on both ML models, a case study is conducted to explore the relationships between specific design variables and overall mechanical performances of the single lap adhesive joint, and optimal designs of structure and material can be obtained.

This transformer is designed to transfer the arbitrary frequency-dependent complex impedances sources to loads at two irrelevant frequencies with one fractional-order inductor and two fractional-order capacitors. Each fractional-order element has two parameters to be determined: the order of the element, which is a discrete number, and its coefficient, which is a continuous numbers. The standard particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved to adapt the simultaneous mixed continuous and discrete variables optimization. The continued fraction expansion method is employed to approximate the fractional-order element characteristics which response is proportional to an arbitrary order of the frequency. An RC network is built to verify the proposed method's effects after each fractional-order element. synthesized by the Caner network synthesis method. The agreement of the calculation and simulation results shows that the proposed transformer has successfully transferred the frequency dependent complex impedances from sources to loads at two frequencies.					杨, 凯/X-3526-2019; CHEN, Peng/F-9444-2014	杨, 凯/0000-0002-5260-571X; CHEN, Peng/0000-0003-1444-5097															978-1-5090-1570-2				2016							613	616																WOS:000392651200163

Optimal design of reliable integrated chemical production sites	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Since plants that form the process network are subjected to fluctuations in product demand or random mechanical failures, design decisions such as adding redundant units and increasing storage between units can increase the flexibility and reliability of an integrated site. In this paper, we develop a bi-criterion optimization model that captures the trade-off between capital investment and process robustness in the design of an integrated site. Design decisions considered are increases in process capacity, introduction of parallel units, and addition of intermediate storage. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation proposed in this paper includes the representation of the material levels in the intermediate storage by means of a probabilistic model that captures the effects of the discrete, uncertain events. We also integrate a superstructure optimization with stochastic modeling techniques such as continuous-time Markov chains. The application of the proposed model is illustrated with two example problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By using functional differential inclusions theory, inequality technique and the non-smooth analysis of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a simple switching adaptive control is designed and some new criteria are obtained to achieve the finite-time synchronization of the proposed drive-response systems. Besides, the upper bound of the settling time is estimated. Based on the finite-time synchronization, we further present a novel discontinuous state-feedback controller to the response neural system in order to derive the fixed-time synchronization criteria and estimate the settling time. Compared with the previous results which can only fixed-timely synchronize or finite-timely synchronize some simple delayed fuzzy neural network systems with continuous activation functions and without uncertain external perturbations, the DFCGNNs with uncertain external perturbations and mixed time delays addressed and the theoretical results of this paper are more generalized and inclusive. Finally, several simulation examples and remarks are provided to verify the correctness and advantages of the main results. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, HP; He, HB				Li, Hepeng; He, Haibo			Learning to Operate Distribution Networks With Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID												In this paper, we propose a safe deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) based method to solve the problem of optimal operation of distribution networks (OODN). We formulate OODN as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). The objective is to achieve adaptive voltage regulation and energy cost minimization considering the uncertainty of renewable resources (RSs), nodal loads and energy prices. The control actions include the number of in-operation units of the switchable capacitor banks (SCBs), the tap position of the on-load tap-changers (OLTCs) and voltage regulators (VRs), the active and reactive power of distributed generators (DGs), and the charging and discharging power of battery storage systems (BSSs). To optimize the discrete and continuous actions simultaneously, a stochastic policy built upon a joint distribution of mixed random variables is designed and learned through a neural network approximator. To guarantee that safety constraints are satisfied, constrained policy optimization (CPO) is employed to train the neural network. The proposed approach enables the agent to learn a cost-effective operating strategy through exploring safe scheduling actions. Compared to traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods that allow agents to freely explore any behaviors during training, the proposed approach is more practical to be applied in a real system. Simulation results on a modified IEEE-34 node system and a modified IEEE-123 node system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Peursum, S; Wu, YH; Rehbock, V				Peursum, Sarah; Wu, Yong Hong; Rehbock, Volker			An analysis of traffic-flow stability in a microscopic heterogeneous network	ROAD & TRANSPORT RESEARCH												Microscopic traffic-flow networks are typically designed to simulate vehicle acceleration behaviour using a single mathematical model. The concept of stability is a major objective of microscopic driver models for traffic simulations. Stable flow is traffic flow that does not fluctuate unaccountably, and changes in flow do not unreasonably magnify downstream, thereby reflecting real-world driver behaviour. However, the stability of driver models is typically evaluated in isolation, with the single model applied to all vehicles and road sections in the traffic network. Yet as different models will be more effective in different situations, it would be desirable to mix multiple models within the one traffic network. Heterogeneous approaches that mix microscopic and macroscopic models exist, but mixing different types of microscopic driver models has been largely overlooked and no analysis of the consequences on stability has been made. Thus this paper investigates the stability characteristics of such microscopic heterogeneous networks, mixing the well-known Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), a continuous-space car-following model, with a discrete-space cellular automata model. To this end, a flaw in the stability of the IDM at the speed limit is identified and corrected. Subsequently it is shown that model switch-over points will experience instabilities despite the stability of the individual driver models and, although careful choice of parameters can reduce the problem, it cannot be completely eliminated in practical road networks. However, the instability produces a signature 'fingerprint' effect on traffic density, and this fingerprint is readily identifiable using simple measures of traffic flow even in realistic road networks.

This problem is more difficult than the redundant allocation problem represented by a nonlinear integer problem (nIP). Recently, several researchers have obtained acceptable and satisfactory results by using genetic algorithms (GAs) to solve optimal reliability assignment/redundant allocation problems. For large-scale problems, however, the GA has to enumerate a vast number of feasible solutions due to the broad continuous search space. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a hybridized GA combined with a neural-network technique (NN-hGA) which is suitable for approximating optimal continuous solutions. Combining a GA with the NN technique makes it easier for the GA to solve an optimal reliability assignment/redundant allocation problem by bounding the broad continuous search space by the NN technique. In addition, the NN-hGA leads to optimal robustness and steadiness and does not affect the various initial conditions of the problems. Numerical experiments and comparisons with previous results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method.

They are usually addressed separately with conventional optimization methods. In this paper, cross-layer optimization problem is considered, namely, the user scheduling and beamforming are jointly discussed, subjecting to the requirement of per-user quality of service and the maximum allowable transmit power for multicell multiuser joint transmission networks. To achieve the goal, a mixed discrete-continuous variables combinational optimization problem is investigated with aiming at maximizing the sum rate of the communication system. To circumvent the original non-convex problem with dynamic solution space, we first transform it into a 0-1 integer and continuous variables optimization problem, and then obtain a tractable form with continuous variables by exploiting the characteristics of the 0-1 integer constraints. Finally, the scheduled users and the optimized beamforming vectors are simultaneously calculated by an alternating optimization algorithm. We also theoretically prove that the base stations allocate zero power to the unscheduled users. Furthermore, two heuristic optimization algorithms are proposed respectively based on brute-force search and greedy search. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and the optimization approach gets relatively balanced results compared with the other two approaches.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												With the aim of integrating over-the-air federated learning (AirFL) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into an on-demand universal framework, this paper proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided hybrid network by leveraging the RIS to flexibly adjust the decoding order of heterogeneous data. A new metric of computation rate is defined to measure the performance of AirFL users. Upon this, the objective of this work is to maximize the achievable hybrid rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power, controlling the receive scalar, and designing the reflection coefficients. Since the concurrent transmissions of all computation and communication signals are aided by the discrete phase-shifting elements at the RIS, the formulated problem (P0) is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem. To tackle this intractable issue, we decompose the original problem (P0) into a non-convex problem (P1) and a combinatorial problem (P2), which are characterized by the continuous and discrete variables, respectively. For the transceiver design problem (P1), the power allocation subproblem is first solved by difference-of-convex programming, and then the receive control subproblem is addressed by successive convex approximation, where the closed-form expressions of simplified cases are derived to obtain deep insights. For the reflection design problem (P2), a relaxation-then-quantization method is adopted to find a suboptimal solution for striking a trade-off between complexity and performance. Afterwards, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve the non-linear non-convex problem (P0) iteratively. Finally, simulation results reveal that i) the proposed RIS-aided hybrid network can support on-demand communication and computation efficiently, ii) the system performance can be improved by properly selecting the location of the RIS, and iii) the designed algorithms are also applicable to conventional networks with only AirFL or NOMA users.

An alternating optimization approach for mixed discrete non-linear programming	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												This article contributes to the development of the field of alternating optimization (AO) and general mixed discrete non-linear programming (MDNLP) by introducing a new decomposition algorithm (AO-MDNLP) based on the augmented Lagrangian multipliers method. In the proposed algorithm, an iterative solution strategy is proposed by transforming the constrained MDNLP problem into two unconstrained components or units; one solving for the discrete variables, and another for the continuous ones. Each unit focuses on minimizing a different set of variables while the other type is frozen. During optimizing each unit, the penalty parameters and multipliers are consecutively updated until the solution moves towards the feasible region.

The optimization model screens capacity selections for MSW technologies over distributed sites with consideration of pretreatment biodrying technologies for waste calorific value enhancement. The choices for these MSW technologies and the network operation are described by binary and continuous variables, respectively. The MSW network economic seeks the maximization of the net present value (NPV). Key environmental impacts of MSW technology use as well as the impacts of MSW transportation are described by a minimization optimization problem. The social target of the MSW network considers the maximization of job creation. When applying the model to a case study, sustainability objective functions showed conflict in the results. Pareto optimal solutions are found from the multi-objective optimization model and a compromised solution is suggested for the considered case study. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A two-stage algorithm for tackling the challenging MINLP problem is devised: at the upper level the selection and sizing of the units is optimized by means of specifically selected evolutionary algorithms, while at the lower level the operational scheduling problem is linearized and optimized with a commercial Mixed Integer Linear Programing solver. Three different approaches, based on two different evolutionary algorithms and discrete variable relaxation, are devised and compared to tackle the upper level problem. Moreover a bounding technique is proposed to limit the computational time required to solve the lower-level problem. The overall algorithm is tested on an industrial scale problem to find the two system designs leading to the minimum energy consumption and the minimum total annual cost. Computational results indicate that the continuous relaxation of the plant sizes significantly helps to improve the convergence rate of the tested evolutionary algorithm and to find improved solutions. For the considered test case, the design optimized for the minimum energy consumption allows to save 64% of primary energy compared to the minimum total annual cost solution, but with a 28% higher total annual cost.

Scalable timing-aware network design via lagrangian decomposition	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												This paper addresses instances of the temporal fixed-charge multi-commodity flow ( tfMCF ) problem that arise in a very large scale dynamic transportation application. We model the tfMCF as a discrete-time Resource Task Network (RTN) with cyclic schedule, and formulate it as a mixed-integer program. These problems are notoriously hard to solve due to their time-expanded nature, and their size renders their direct solution difficult. We exploit synergies between flows of certain commodities in the formulation to devise model condensation techniques that reduce the number of variables and constraints by a factor of 25%-50%. We propose a solution algorithm that includes balanced graph partitioning, Lagrangian decomposition and a linear programming filtering heuristic. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm allows the solution of previously intractable instances, and the primal solution obtained by the heuristic step is within 2% duality gap of the linear relaxation of the original problem.

By using Lyapunov and time scales theory, a novel sufficient condition to guarantee the synchronization of CDNs is obtained. The method of intermittent pinning control is adopted in designing controllers to ensure the realization of synchronization of CDNs. Unlike most existing results, our results are an extension of previous results, integral delay and coupling disturbance are considered in the time -delay nonlinear CDNs. Therefore, our results are less conservative but more persuasive. Moreover, our model can be applied not only to continuous/discrete CDNS, but also to mixed CDNs. Finally, we give numerical simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of our theory.

J	Cheng, Y; Zhang, JD; Li, C; Zhu, DY				Cheng, Yuan; Zhang, Jindong; Li, Chen; Zhu, Daiyin			Orthogonal anti-jamming waveform design with extended Doppler tolerance based on the LFM-PC signal	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING												Designing orthogonal waveforms based on linear frequency modulation and phase-coded (LFM-PC) signals with extended Doppler tolerance plays a vital role in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems. However, it is difficult to address the major problem of the mixed nonconvex unimodulus and nonlinear fourth-order polynomial constraints in sequence set design. In this paper, an orthogonal waveform based on the LFM-PC signal is designed for the discrete phase-coded sequence (DPCS) and continuous phase-coded sequence (CPCS). The hybrid alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and coordinate descending (CD) algorithm are applied to the DPCS design. A novel method is designed with the approach of ADMM and the Lagrange programming neural network (LPNN) algorithm for the CPCS. The specific objective of this study is to propose new chirplike phase codes and a new algorithm framework that can separate the complex nonconvex and nonlinear constraints by ADMM, and we transfer the fourth-order polynomials from the nonlinear constraints into the Lagrange function. As a result, the optimized variables are updated in the ADMM-CD and ADMM-LPNN frameworks. Numerical simulation examples indicate the good performance of the proposed methods, and we compare these two effective methods. (C)& nbsp;2021 Elsevier Inc.

It is designed network of genes with mutual inhibition and/or activation resulting in triple negative, double negative (i.e. positive feedback) or classical negative feedback or positive feedback. Mathematical model which describes these networks is nonlinear. Approximating two main processes as fast and slow, the model results into multiple (specifically, two) time scale model, i.e. singular system which is of reduced dimension. Further, approximating Hill's nonlinear terms with switch-like function, the model results to impulsive or singularly-impulsive model. Also, having in mind that different species might have different number of molecules present, for case of small number of molecules discrete approximation is given, since by nature, the continuum approximation is not valid any more. Further, it is possible to have some species in small number of molecules with discrete approximation, while other species are present in excess so that continuum approximation holds, what results in mixed discrete-continuous model, what is another class of singularly impulsive, i.e. hybrid model. Stability results and responses are given for the biologically plausible set of parameter data.

Modeling and solving discrete network design problem with stochastic user equilibrium	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION												In this paper, we address the discrete network design problem, which determines the addition of new roads to existing transportation network to optimize the transportation system performance. Road users are assumed to follow the traffic assignment principle of stochastic user equilibrium. A mixed-integer nonlinear nonconvex problem is developed to model this discrete network design problem with stochastic user equilibrium. The original problem is relaxed into a convex mixed-integer nonlinear program, whose solution provides a lower bound of the original problem.

Estimating Multiscale Direct Causality Graphs in Neural Spike-Field Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING												Neural representations span various spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, from the spiking activity of single neurons to field activity measuring large-scale networks. The simultaneous analyses of spikes and fields to uncover causal interactions in multiscale networks could help understand neural mechanisms. However, assessing causality within spike-field networks is challenging as spikes are binary-valued with a fast time-scale while fields are continuous-valued with slower time-scales. Current causality measures are largely not applicable to mixed discrete-continuous network activity. Here, in this paper, we develop a novel multiscale causality estimation algorithm for spike-field networks. We construct a likelihood function comprised of point process models for spikes and linear Gaussian models for fields. For spikes, firing rates are modeled as a function of the history of both field signals and binary spike events within the network. For fields, to make their linear models consistent with biophysical findings, we use the history of field signals and the history of the latent log-firing rates of neurons as predictors. To resolve the challenge of estimating the network model parameters in the presence of latent firing rates, we develop a sequential maximum-likelihood parameter estimation procedure that extends to large networks. Once models are estimated, we compute directed information as our measure of multiscale causality and devise two statistical tests to assess its significance. Using extensive simulations, we show that the algorithm can accurately reconstruct the true causality graphs of random spike-field networks. Moreover, the algorithm is robust to the number of connections, connection strengths, or exact topology of the network. This multiscale causality estimation algorithm has important implications for studying neural mechanisms and for future neurotechnology design.

These problems exhibit logical relationships between continuous and discrete variables, which are usually reformulated linearly using a big-M formulation. In this work, we challenge this long-standing modeling practice and express the logical constraints in a nonlinear way. By imposing a regularization condition, we reformulate these problems as convex binary optimization problems, which are solvable using an outer-approximation procedure. In numerical experiments, we establish that a general-purpose numerical strategy, which combines cutting-plane, first-order, and local search methods, solves these problems faster and at a larger scale than state-of-the-art mixed-integer linear or second-order cone methods. Our approach successfully solves network design problems with 100s of nodes and provides solutions up to 40\% better than the state of the art, sparse portfolio selection problems with up to 3,200 securities compared with 400 securities for previous attempts, and sparse regression problems with up to 100,000 covariates.

J	Gao, S; Fan, LH				Gao, Su; Fan, Luhai			Clustering Information Distance by Nested-Lattice Compression	IEEE ACCESS												Clustering of mixed dataset is one of the key issues in complex system architecture decomposition and many other pattern recognition applications. Recent development of machine learning techniques, especially deep neural network models significantly boost clustering performance, whereas theoretical analysis explaining why it works and how to further improve the performance is limited in literature. From the information theoretical point of view, information distance based on Kolmogorov complexity captures non-feature similarities and works as an absolute information measure. Thus, it is valuable to model the clustering process of mixed discrete and continuous datasets with this generalized similarity measure, and investigate the practical implementation of the information distance, compression distance, to make it work within the machine learning-enabled clustering schemes. In this paper, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based deep clustering scheme is modified to compare the similarities of the original data in order to reduce the deviation of projected features from real data characteristics. The compression distance is extended to be computable for continuous data with the assistance of the Wyner-Ziv setup, where theoretical limit is given via asymptotically optimal nested lattices. Flatness-based analysis is carried out with distance upper bound derived for non-vanishing flatness factor. Practical distance calculation is derived to incorporate with neural-network-based clustering. Simulation via practical lattice codes illustrates the consistency of the design and shows its potential effectiveness in clustering applications.																			2169-3536						2019	7						156228	156236		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946321													WOS:000497165400076

Optimal Scheduling of Multiproduct Pipelines in Networks with Reversible Flow	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												This paper presents a new continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming formulation for scheduling pipeline systems transporting liquid products. It is a generic formulation with respect to the structure of the network (nodes and connecting segments form the building blocks) and to the direction of flow that can change as many times as required. Nodes are connected to one or more pipeline segments, and external interactions with refineries (at a constant rate) and local markets may be included for better inventory control. To ensure a computationally efficient formulation by design, constraints with binary and continuous variables were first written as disjunction and then convex-hull reformulated. It is validated through the solution of six benchmark problems from the literature involving straight pipelines with reversible flow as well as tree-like and mesh structures with unidirectional flow. The schedules obtained by the optimization reflect, in most cases, a better utilization of the pipeline capacity.

The Lyapunov functions we synthesize are parameterized by feedforward neural networks with leaky ReLU activation units. To train these neural networks, we design a loss function that measures the maximal violation of the Lyapunov conditions in the state space. We show that this maximal violation can be computed by solving a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Compared to previous learning-based approaches, our learning approach is able to certify with high precision that the learned neural network satisfies the Lyapunov conditions not only for sampled states, but over the entire state space. Moreover, compared to previous optimization-based approaches that require a pre-specified partition of the state space when synthesizing piecewise Lyapunov functions, our method can automatically search for both the partition and the Lyapunov function simultaneously. We demonstrate our algorithm on both continuous and discrete-time systems, including some for which known strategies for partitioning of the Lyapunov function would require introducing higher order Lyapunov functions.

First, a two-step homogenization approach based on mechanics of structure genome (MSG) is developed to predict effective thermal conductivity. The accuracy and efficiency of the MSG model are compared with the representative volume element (RVE) model based on three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA). Then, the simulation data is generated by the MSG model to train neural network models to predict the effective thermal conductivity of three 2D woven composites. The neural network models have mixed input features: continuous input (e.g., fiber volume fraction and yarn geometries) and discrete input (e.g., weave patterns). Moreover, the neural network models are trained with the normalized features to enable reusability.

In order to survive, wholesalers are rethinking their strategies to increase competitiveness. This paper proposes an optimization-simulation approach to address the wholesalers network redesign problem, trading off the operational costs and customer service level. Firstly, at a strategic-tactical level, the supply chain network redesign decisions are optimized via a mixed integer programming model. Here, the number, location, function and capacity of the warehouses, the allocation of customers to the warehouses and the capacity and function of the distribution channels are defined. Secondly, at an operation level, the solution found is evaluated by means of a discrete event simulation model to assess the impact of the redesign in the wholesaler's daily activities.

Thus, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for PHEVs based on the mixed logical dynamical (MLD) model and short-term vehicle speed prediction is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the mathematical model of the controlled PHEV is set-up to evaluate the energy consumption using the linearized models of core power components. Then, based on the recognition of driving intention and the past vehicle speed data, a nonlinear auto-regressive (NAR) neural network structure is designed to predict the vehicle speed for known driving profiles of city buses and the predicted vehicle speed is used to calculate the total required torque. Next, a MLD model is established with appropriate constraints for six possible driving modes. By solving the objective function with the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) algorithm, the optimal motor torque and the corresponding driving mode sequence within the speed prediction horizon can be obtained. Finally, the proposed energy control strategy shows substantial improvement in fuel economy in the simulation results.																				1996-1073				JAN	2017	10	1							74	10.3390/en10010074	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en10010074													WOS:000392422500074

Here the mixed time-varying delays contain both discrete and distributed time-varying delays. Based on a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with a zero equation, a suitable H-infinity filter is obtained for the static neural networks model. The filter can be solved by a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Two numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method. In addition, the obtained filter can be applied to design the control systems with delays.

However, it is difficult to use a network simulator to simulate a hybrid system in which some objects are not discrete event-driven but are continuous time-driven. A networked control system (NCS) is such an application, in which physical process dynamics are continuous by nature. We have designed and implemented a hybrid simulation environment which effectively integrates models of continuous-time plant processes and discrete-event communication networks by extending the open source network simulator NS-2. To do this a synchronisation mechanism was developed to connect a continuous plant simulation with a discrete network simulation. Furthermore, for evaluating co-design approaches in an NCS environment, a piggybacking method was adopted to allow the control period to be adjusted during simulations. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated through case studies which simulate a networked control scenario in which the communication and control system properties are defined explicitly.					peng, chen/HHS-8720-2022; Tian, Yu-Chu/I-9948-2012; Fidge, Colin/J-1036-2012	peng, chen/0000-0003-3652-2233; Tian, Yu-Chu/0000-0002-8709-5625; Fidge, Colin/0000-0002-9410-7217															978-1-4244-4926-2				2009							331	340																WOS:000275140200032

In order to update the discrete parameters in the back-propagation, we use an inverse design network combined with a new constraint function to optimize these two types of parameters together. The forward network model which is trained firstly and is responsible for giving an approximate range of the parameters. The inverse design network then finds the exact parameters in this range by employing back-propagation. Our optimization strategy could find several sets of design parameters that well match the target spectrum, which is an effective method to tackle the problem of nonuniqueness in the inverse design.

Integration of Design and NMPC-Based Control under Uncertainty and Structural Decisions: An MPCC-Based Approach	IFAC PAPERSONLINE					22nd World Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)	JUL 09-14, 2023	Yokohama, JAPAN					In this work, we investigate the challenges and limitations of the application of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for the integration of design and control for systems subject to structural decisions and model uncertainty. The problem involving discrete and continuous decisions is referred to as a mixed-integer bilevel programming model (MIBLP), which cannot be directly solved with conventional MINLP solvers. To address this issue, we implement a classical KKT transformation strategy to transform the original MIBLP into a single-level MINLP. The KKT conditions for the NMPC are determined and incorporated as constraints in the problem for process design. A regularization strategy is implemented to reformulate the complementarity constraints. Then, the single- level MINLP is directly solved with a branch and bound strategy. The proposed approach is tested in a reaction system network subject to uncertainty. The performance of a nominal- and a robust-NMPC control approaches are compared in the presence of process disturbances. Results indicate that the strategy with a robust-NMPC returns a more conservative process design with better control performance compared to results with a nominal-NMPC.																			2405-8963						2023	56	2					4442	4447		10.1016/j.ifacol.2023.10.1837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2023.10.1837													WOS:001196709200217

Optimal Design of PV Systems in Electrical Distribution Networks by Minimizing the Annual Equivalent Operative Costs through the Discrete-Continuous Vortex Search Algorithm	SENSORS												This paper discusses the minimization of the total annual operative cost for a planning period of 20 years composed by the annualized costs of the energy purchasing at the substation bus summed with the annualized investment costs in photovoltaic (PV) sources, including their maintenance costs in distribution networks based on their optimal siting and sizing. This problem is presented using a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model, which is resolved by applying a master-slave methodology. The master stage, consisting of a discrete-continuous version of the Vortex Search Algorithm (DCVSA), is responsible for providing the optimal locations and sizes for the PV sources-whereas the slave stage employs the Matricial Backward/Forward Power Flow Method, which is used to determine the fitness function value for each individual provided by the master stage. Numerical results in the IEEE 33- and 69-node systems with AC and DC topologies illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach when compared to the discrete-continuous version of the Chu and Beasley genetic algorithm with the optimal location of three PV sources. All the numerical validations were carried out in the MATLAB programming environment.

Two nonlinear mixed-integer program (NMIP) models for continuous and discrete capacity decisions are proposed, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total costs, including fixed location cost, transportation cost, congestion cost and capacity cost. Congestion at intermediate facilities is modeled as the ratio of total flow to surplus capacity by viewing each facility as an M/M/1 queuing system. To solve NMIP with continuous capacity decision, we apply the Lagrangean algorithm that has been proposed to solve the classic inventory-location model. For the NMIP with discrete capacity decision, we propose another Lagrangean algorithm where the problem is decomposed into vertical bar K vertical bar subproblems that can be solved to optimality. The measures of allocation heuristic, capacity increase and capacity adjustment are taken to construct feasible solutions. Computational results indicate that the heuristics for the two models are both efficient and effective.

The growing availability of additive manufacturing has enabled the design of microfluidic devices with new functionality and complexity. However, these devices are prone to larger manufacturing variation than is typical of those made with micromachining or soft lithography. In this report, we demonstrate a design-for-manufacturing workflow that addresses performance variation at the microfluidic element and circuit level, in context of mass-manufacturing and additive manufacturing. Our approach relies on discrete microfluidic elements that are characterized by their terminal hydraulic resistance and associated tolerance. Network analysis is employed to construct simple analytical design rules for model microfluidic circuits. Monte Carlo analysis is employed at both the individual element and circuit level to establish expected performance metrics for several specific circuit configurations. A protocol based on osmometry is used to experimentally probe mixing behavior in circuits in order to validate these approaches. The overall workflow is applied to two application circuits with immediate use at on the bench-top: series and parallel mixing circuits that are modularly programmable, virtually predictable, highly precise, and operable by hand.

In such configuration, a continuous system can't directly communicate with a discrete event system. Therefore, a form of interface between two systems is required for possible communication. An interface from a continuous system to a discrete event system requires abstraction of a continuous system as a discrete event system. This paper proposes a methodology for abstraction of a continuous system as a discrete event system using neural network, A continuous system is first represented by a timed state transition model and then the model is mapped into a neural network by learning capability of the network. With a simple example, this paper describes the abstraction process ill detail and discusses application methods of the neural network model. Finally, an application of such abstraction in design of intelligent control is discussed.																					0-8194-2498-6				1997	3083						42	51		10.1117/12.276729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.276729													WOS:A1997BJ16T00005

Design/methodology/approachIn the domains which are separated by the porous layers, uniform magnetic field with different strengths is used and as the solution technique finite element method is used. The numerical study is conducted considering different values of parameters: Reynolds number (250-1000), strength of magnetic field in different domains (Hartmann number between 0 and 20), permeability of discrete or continuous layers (Darcy number between 105 and 102) and number of layers in discrete case (2-10). Artificial neural network is used for performance estimation of systems equipped with different types of porous layers. FindingsIt is observed that significant differences occur in the local Nu between the discrete and continuous layer case, especially at lower Re, while peak Nu value is 77% higher in discrete layer configurations as compared to continuous one at Re = 250. Upper domain magnetic field results in average Nu enhancement, while the trend is opposite for the lower domain magnetic field strength. The increment amount becomes 10%, while the reduction amount is obtained as 38% at the highest magnetic field strengths. The permeability of layers in both cases and number of layers in discrete porous layer case provide effective solution for the cooling performance control. A modeling approach based on artificial neural networks provides fast thermal performance estimations of multiple impinging jets equipped with discrete and continuous porous layers. Originality/valueOutcomes of the study are useful in development and optimization of new cooling systems in many thermal engineering systems encountered in photovoltaic panels, micro-electro-mechanical systems, metal processing and many others.

New robust LMI synthesis conditions for mixed H2/H∞ gain-scheduled reduced-order DOF control of discrete-time LPV systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												This paper investigates the problems of stabilization and mixed H2/H infinity reduced-order dynamic output-feedback control of discrete-time linear systems. The synthesis conditions are formulated in terms of parameterdependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) combined with scalar parameters, dealing with state-space models where the matrices depend polynomially on time-varying parameters and are affected by norm-bounded uncertainties. The motivation to handle these models comes from the context of networked control systems, particularly when a continuous-time plant is controlled by a digitally implemented controller. The main technical contribution is a distinct LMI-based condition for the dynamic output-feedback problem, allowing an arbitrary structure (polynomial of arbitrary degree) for the measured output matrix. Additionally, an innovative heuristic is proposed to reduce the conservativeness of the stabilization problem. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the potentialities of the approach to cope with several classes of discrete-time linear systems (time-invariant and time-varying) and the efficiency of the proposed design conditions when compared with other methods available in the literature.

J	Abdelrahim, M; Almakhles, D				Abdelrahim, Mahmoud; Almakhles, Dhafer			Output-Based Dynamic Periodic Event-Triggered Control with Application to the Tunnel Diode System	JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS												The integration of communication channels with the feedback loop in a networked control system (NCS) is attractive for many applications. A major challenge in the NCS is to reduce transmissions over the network between the sensors, the controller, and the actuators to avoid network congestion. An efficient approach to achieving this goal is the event-triggered implementation where the control actions are only updated when necessary from stability/performance perspectives. In particular, periodic event-triggered control (PETC) has garnered recent attention because of its practical implementation advantages. This paper focuses on the design of stabilizing PETC for linear time-invariant systems. It is assumed that the plant state is partially known; the feedback signal is sent to the controller at discrete-time instants via a digital channel; and an event-triggered controller is synthesized, solely based on the available plant measurement. The constructed event-triggering law is novel and only verified at periodic time instants; it is more adapted to practical implementations. The proposed approach ensures a global asymptotic stability property for the closed-loop system under mild conditions. The overall model is developed as a hybrid dynamical system to truly describe the mixed continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics. The stability is studied using appropriate Lyapunov functions. The efficiency of the technique is illustrated in the dynamic model of the tunnel diode system.					; Abdelrahim, Mahmoud/JGM-9026-2023	Almakhles, Dhafer J./0000-0002-5165-0754; Abdelrahim, Mahmoud/0009-0002-3940-9711														2224-2708				OCT	2023	12	5							66	10.3390/jsan12050066	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jsan12050066													WOS:001093534500001
J	Miguel, LFF; Lopez, RH; Miguel, LFF				Fadel Miguel, Leandro Fleck; Lopez, Rafael Holdorf; Fadel Miguel, Leticia Fleck			Multimodal size, shape, and topology optimisation of truss structures using the Firefly algorithm	ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE												This paper presents an efficient single-stage Firefly-based algorithm (FA) to simultaneously optimise the size, shape and topology of truss structures. The optimisation problem uses the minimisation of structural weight as its objective function and imposes displacement, stress and kinematic stability constraints. Unstable and singular topologies are disregarded as possible solutions by checking the positive definiteness of the stiffness matrix. Because cross-sectional areas are usually defined by discrete values in practice due to manufacturing limitations, the optimisation algorithm must assess a mixed-variable optimisation problem that includes both discrete and continuous variables at the same time. The effectiveness of the FA at solving this type of optimisation problem is demonstrated with benchmark problems, the results for which are better than those reported in the literature and obtained with lower computational costs, emphasising the capabilities of the proposed methodology. In addition, the procedure is capable of providing multiple optima and near-optimal solutions in each run, providing a set of possible designs at the end of the optimisation process.

J	Yoo, J; Hajela, P				Yoo, J; Hajela, P			Immune network simulations in multicriterion design	STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION												A modification to the genetic algorithm (GA) based search procedure, based on the modeling of a biological immune system, is proposed as an approach to solving the multicriterion design problem. Such problems have received considerable attention, given that decisions in engineering design practice typically require allocation of resources to satisfy multiple, and frequently conflicting requirements. The approach is particularly amenable to problems with a mix of continuous, discrete, and integer design variables, where the GA has been shown to perform in an effective manner. The approach considered in the present work is based on the concept of converting the multicriterion problem into one with a scalar objective through the use of the utility function. The strength of the approach is in its ability to generate the Pareto-Edgeworth front of compromise solutions in a single execution of the GA. A characteristic feature of biological immune systems which allows for the generation of multiple specialist antibodies, is shown to be an effective approach to facilitate the generation of the Pareto-Edgeworth front. Solutions to problems in structural design are presented in support of the proposed approach.																			0934-4373					OCT	1999	18	2-3					85	94		10.1007/s001580050109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s001580050109													WOS:000083505700001
J	Kavitha, V; Combes, R				Kavitha, Veeraruna; Combes, Richard			Mixed polling with rerouting and applications	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION												Queueing systems with a single server in which customers wait to be served at a finite number of distinct locations (buffers/queues) are called discrete polling systems. Polling systems in which arrivals of users occur anywhere in a continuum are called continuous polling systems. Often one encounters a combination of the two systems: the users can either arrive in a continuum or wait in a finite set (i.e. wait at a finite number of queues). We call these systems mixed polling systems. Also, in some applications, customers are rerouted to a new location (for another service) after their service is completed. In this work, we study mixed polling systems with rerouting. We obtain their steady state performance by discretization using the known pseudo conservation laws of discrete polling systems. Their stationary expected workload is obtained as a limit of the stationary expected workload of a discrete system. The main tools for our analysis are: (a) the fixed point analysis of infinite dimensional operators and; (b) the convergence of Riemann sums to an integral. We analyze two applications using our results on mixed polling systems and discuss the optimal system design. We consider a local area network, in which a moving ferry facilitates communication (data transfer) using a wireless link. We also consider a distributed waste collection system and derive the optimal collection point. In both examples, the service requests can arrive anywhere in a subset of the two dimensional plane. Namely, some users arrive in a continuous set while others wait for their service in a finite set. The only polling systems that can model these applications are mixed systems with rerouting as introduced in this manuscript. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In graph theory terms, the DCMNDP requires designing a minimum cost network by installing at most one facility on each edge while the installed capacities permit the routing of a prescribed multi-commodity flow value. We focus on investigating polynomial-sized Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations. Besides a basic arc-flow formulation, two new overflow and flow aggregation based formulations are proposed. To improve the performance of the proposed formulations, valid cuts/constraints are appended.

It involves profit maximization and the determination of the optimal cycle time, while meeting the minimum demands for the several products. Resource-Task Network-based formulations are employed and a detailed comparison between continuous- and discrete-time models is provided. Both have the improved capability of handling tasks with flexible proportions of input materials in order to consider the incorporation of different flowrates of byproducts that are recycled back to the first production stage. The continuous-time formulation is shown to be more efficient and the resulting mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) can be solved to optimality within reasonable computational time. A new recycling policy is proposed that achieves the double goal of making the process more profitable due to important savings oil the more expensive raw-materials and also more environmentally friendly, due to the reduction of waste disposal requirements.

Farther more the discrete-time quadratic performance index is revised to take network-induced delay into account. Base on the results above, a discrete Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed and network QoS constraints is proposed to guarantee the performance of the control system. To satisfy the QoS constraints, a co-design method of control and scheduling is proposed to guarantee both networked control performance and network QoS.

By using functional differential inclusions theory, inequality technique, and the non-smooth analysis of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a simple switching adaptive controller and a switching state-feedback controller are designed, some new criteria are obtained to achieve the finite-time and fixed-time synchronization of the proposed drive-response systems. Besides, the upper bound of the settling time of finite-time synchronization is estimated, and the settling time of fixed-time synchronization can be given in advance. In spite of many previous results on the synchronization of fuzzy neutral-type neural network and stability analysis of neural networks of neutral-type in Hale's form with continuous activation functions, few references on the stability and synchronization control analysis of the neural network like the form of the neural network model addressed in this paper can be cited.

Optimal test and sensor selection for active fault diagnosis using integer programming	JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL												A model-based method is presented for the simultaneous selection of tests and sensors in fault detection and isolation (FDI) of systems subject to uncertainty. Tests and sensors are selected out of a continuous or discrete set of options based on their contribution to information gain with respect to fault identifiability. The objective of the optimization of the tests designed is to maximize the sensitivity of sensed outputs with respect to faults and minimize the joint confidence between faults and sources of uncertainty. The methodology is intended for active FDI in systems that can be limited to a finite number of input design scenarios, with a set of sensors that may or may not be valuable for the purpose of fault detection. The optimization of discrete sensors and input designs is formulated as a constrained mixed integer non-linear program that maximizes a measure of Fisher information, which calculates output sensitivities with respect to faults and uncertainty, by treating those as parameters in the system model. Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to determine the isolation capacity of a FDI test when there is uncertainty in inputs and parameters. FDI tests are executed using k-nearest neighbor classification, which is used as a verification method for test designs and sensor networks that result in high correct classification rates. The proposed design framework is tested on a virtual benchmark three-tank system, subject to multiple faults and sources of uncertainty. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As for the operation of UAV-assisted MEC, jointly design of the UAV trajectory control and computation offloading strategies becomes the key for achieving high offloading efficiency, which is extremely challenging due to the uncertain and dynamic demands in the network. In this paper, aiming at maximizing the offloading task amount, we propose an Multi-Agent joint TrAjectory and Computation Offloading (MA-TACO) scheme, where all related factors including task type variety, quality of service (QoS) guarantee, and service fairness are taken into account. To facilitate each UAV to obtain the best joint strategy under dynamic network environment, considering the complex decisions with both continuous and discrete variables, we develop an Optimization-oriented Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning approach (OMADRL), where each UAV could autonomously learn the trajectory decision to adapt to the dynamic demands, and the offloading decision would be made by solving a mixed-integer programming problem based on the observations, which would be utilized to guide the trajectory learning. Comparing with solely relying on learning, such an optimization-oriented way could reduce the action space dimension and make each UAV achieve the best strategy faster. The simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

To achieve its self-sustainability, IRS collects energy from the energy station to support its own control circuit operation. Our proposed policy for the considered WPSN is called IRS assisted harvest-then-transmit time switching (IRS-HTT-TS), which is capable to schedule the transmission time slots by switching between energy collection and energy reflection modes. We provide a joint design of the transmission time slots, the power allocation as well as the discrete phase shifts of the WET and WIT, aiming to maximize the system sum throughput. This formulates a problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard and non-convex. To effectively solve this problem, we first relax it to the one with continuous phase shifts, and then propose a two-step approach and decompose the original problem into two sub-problems. We address the first sub-problem in closed form with respect to the phase shifts of the WIT. For the second sub-problem, we apply the Lagrange dual method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to derive the optimal closed-form transmission time slots, power allocation, and phase shift of the WET, respectively. The optimal discrete phase shifts can be obtained by quantizing the continuous values. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy and validate the beneficial role of the IRS in comparison to the benchmark schemes.

A special translation of variables in mixed-integer, relaxed, and logic-based variations has been proposed, which enables modeling and solving process alternatives in a narrowed lifted space of variables, defined by nonzero lower and upper bounds. Based on these translation variations, alternative formulations have been developed for convex hulls, multiple-term generalized disjunctive programming problems, and logic-based outer-approximation algorithm, all of them being specialized for the synthesis of process flowsheets. Several studies were performed and three different large-scale synthesis problems were solved to test the performance and efficiency of different formulations. This initial research indicates that the proposed alternative convex hull representation usually outperforms the conventional one when solving both MILP and NLP steps in highly combinatorial MINLP process networks problems.

This paper studies a typical vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication scenario, in which multiple source nodes desire to deliver different types of messages to their respective destinations. Considering the case that accurate instantaneous global channel state information (CSI) is unavailable, properly selecting access channel, transmission power, and data rate at each source to optimize the links' performance is an extremely involved mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem. We propose applying the distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning technique to solve the problem. Specifically, a distributed multi-agent parameterized deep Q-network (DMA-PDQN) algorithm is employed to explore optimal decision in the discrete-continuous hybrid action space. The idea of federated meta learning (FML) is also adopted to tackle the non-stationarity issue and improve the training efficiency of distributed agents. Using energy efficiency (EE) as the target transmission objective, through extensive simulation we show that our method can achieve excellent convergence and performance.

J	Cheng, Y; Pesavento, M				Cheng, Yong; Pesavento, Marius			Joint Discrete Rate Adaptation and Downlink Beamforming Using Mixed Integer Conic Programming	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING												Multiuser downlink beamforming for sum-rate maximization has been intensively studied in the literature assuming that the achievable data rates of the mobile stations (MSs) are continuous and strictly increasing functions of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs). However, in practical cellular networks that employ adaptive modulation and coding, the data rates of the MSs are determined by the specific modulation and coding schemes and thus attain discrete values. We consider in this paper discrete rate adaptation and downlink beamforming (RAB), where the discrete rate assignment is jointly optimized along with the beamformer design to achieve the maximum sum-rate with minimum total transmitted power of the base station. User admission control is embedded in the discrete rate assignment procedure. We address the RAB problem using a mixed integer second-order cone program (MI-SOCP) approach, proposing a standard big-M MI-SOCP formulation that supports the branch-and-cut (BnC) method. To reduce the complexity of the BnC algorithm, we further develop an improved extended MI-SOCP formulation. We analytically show that the extended formulation generally admits strictly tighter continuous relaxations (and thus less computational complexity) than that of the big-M formulation. Efficient strategies are proposed to customize the standard BnC method for the RAB problem. For applications in large-scale networks, we develop low-complexity SOCP based inflation and deflation procedures to find suboptimal solutions of the RAB problem. Simulations show that the inflation and deflation procedures yield sum-rates that are very close to that of the optimal solutions.

J	Colvin, RJ				Colvin, Robert J.			Modelling and analysing neural networks using a hybrid process algebra	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE												Research involving artificial neural networks has tended to be driven towards efficient computation, especially in the domain of pattern recognition, or towards elucidating biological processes in the brain. Models have become more detailed as our understanding of the biology of the brain has increased, incorporating real-time behaviour of individual neurons interacting within complex system structures and dynamics. There are few examples of abstract and fully formal models of biologically plausible neural networks: in the neural networks literature models are often presented as a mixture of mathematical equations and natural language, supported by simulation code and associated experimental results. The informality often hides or obscures important aspects of a particular model, and leaves a large conceptual gap between the model descriptions and the usually low-level programming code used to simulate them. The main contribution of this paper is formally modelling and analysing a biologically plausible neural network model from the literature that exhibits complex neuron-level behaviour and network-level structure. To achieve this a modelling language 'Pann' is developed, based on the process algebras CSP and Hybrid chi. It is designed to be convenient for mixing the behaviour of discrete events (such as a neuron spike) with mutable continuous and discrete variables (representing chemical properties of a neuron, for instance). Its behaviour is defined using an operational semantics, from which a set of general properties of the language is proved. The groundwork for the biological model is laid by first formalising some well-known concepts from the artificial neural networks domain, such as feedforward behaviour, backpropagation, and recurrent neural networks. The Pann model of a feedforward network, comprising a set of communicating processes representing individual neurons, is proved equivalent to the standard one-line calculation of feedforward behaviour.

Both mixed random delays and packet dropouts in the communication channels are considered. The mixed time-delays consists of the discrete and distributed delays. And the packet dropout phenomenon occurs in a random way. Three mutually independent Bernoulli distributed random variables are utilized to model the stochastic phenomena. By using the Lyapunov-Kravoskii stability approach, sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the closed-loop filter error system is regular, causal and stable with a certain H-infinity performance index.

However, the signal processing precision in mixed signal implementations is limited. A mixed-signal arithmetic method called Continuous Valued Number Systems (CVNS) is employed for development and implementation of different functions required in a neuronal network. Analog digits of this number system enable the higher accuracy of analog operations, and can efficiently relate with digital and binary values. In this paper, design and implementation of a 2-2-1 mixed-signal CVNS network structure is presented, to confirm the developed arithmetic method. In the proposed structure, weights are stored in the digital registers while the arithmetic is based on the CVNS. The CVNS features have been exploited to address the limited signal processing precision issue, which requires resolutions higher than 12-bit for online training of the network. As a result, the proposed structure satisfies this requirement of neural networks, while yielding an optimized network configuration. The proposed network is designed, fabricated, and tested in 0.18 pm technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Low-Resolution RIS-Aided Multiuser MIMO Signaling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS												A multi-antenna aided base station (BS) supporting several multi-antenna downlink users with the aid of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) of programmable reflecting elements (PREs) is considered. Low-resolution PREs constrained by a set of sparse discrete values are used for reasons of cost-efficiency. Our challenging objective is to jointly design the beamformers at the BS and the RIS's PREs for improving the throughput of all users by maximizing their geometric-mean, under a variety of different access schemes. This constitutes a computationally challenging problem of mixed continuous-discrete optimization, because each user's throughput is a complicated function of both the continuous-valued beamformer weights and of the discrete-valued PREs. We develop low-complexity algorithms, which iterate by directly evaluating low-complexity closed-form expressions. Our simulation results show the advantages of non-orthogonal multiple access-aided signaling, which allows the users to decode a part of the multi-user interference for enhancing their throughput.

J	Wang, GM; Gao, ZY; Xu, M				Wang, Guangmin; Gao, Ziyou; Xu, Meng			Integrating link-based discrete credit charging scheme into discrete network design problem	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												In this paper, we present an optimization model for integrating link-based discrete credit charging scheme into the discrete network design problem, to improve the transport performance from the perspectives of both transport network planning and travel demand management. The proposed model is a mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel programming problem, which includes an upper level problem for the transport authority and a lower level problem for the network users. The lower level sub-model is the traffic network user equilibrium (UE) formulation for a given network design strategy determined by the upper level problem. The network user at the lower level tries to minimize his/her own generalized travel cost (including both the travel time and the value of the credit charged for using the link) by choosing his/her route. While the transport authority at the upper level tries to find the optimal number of lanes and credit charging level with their locations to minimize the total system travel time (or maximize the transportation system performance). A genetic algorithm is used to solve the proposed mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel programming problem. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed model for traffic congestion mitigation, reveal that interaction effects across the tradable credit scheme and the discrete network design problem which amplify their individual effects. Moreover, the integrated model can achieve better performance than the sequential decision problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Milani, D; Luu, MT; Nelson, S; Puxty, G; Abbas, A				Milani, Dia; Luu, Minh Tri; Nelson, Scott; Puxty, Graeme; Abbas, Ali			A novel design protocol for solar-powered carbon capture	THERMAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PROGRESS												To solarize the carbon capture industry and move away from the power plant steam cycle, this paper presents a new methodology for solar-powered post-combustion carbon capture (SP-PCC). It comprises a rigorous thermodynamic model for a "solar stripper" (So-St) network design to promote this SP-PCC over the solar-assisted (SA-PCC) counterparts. In this work, the absorber, the So-St network, and the solvent storage are synchronized within a generic design protocol. This design protocol primarily creates an extended design database, and then, applies a set of design filters to shortlist promising designs based on specific physical and/or performance criteria. As a buffering media, solvent storage capacity (SSC) is sized to ensure continuous solvent availability at both terminals (absorption-desorption) of the solvent cycle. Three key optimization strategies namely, the absorber stoppage time, synchronized solar multiple (SM), and multi-tank mix-match strategy are deployed to reduce the SSC and potentially improve the economic model. It is found that the latter strategy can save up to 49.5% of the SSC requirement compared to the basic two-discrete storage system. Furthermore, by combining these three optimisation strategies, it is found when SM increases by 2.5 folds, the SSC requirement is reduced to only 7.6% of the baseline SSC requirement when SM = 1. This calculation demonstrates the significant trade-off implications between the SM vs. SSC which can only be enhanced via economic optimizations. Validating this state-of-the-art technology by a rigorous techno-economic and life cycle assessment (LCA) could truly innovate the PCC technology and significantly improve its popularity and sustainability.

In recent years, multimodal network design problems have benefited from simulation-based models. The nonconvexity and implicity of bi-level DNDPs make it challenging to obtain an optimal solution, especially for simulation-related models. Bayesian optimization (BO) has been proven to be an effective method for optimizing the costly black-box functions of simulation-based continuous network design problems. However, there are only discrete inputs in DNDPs, which cannot be processed using standard BO algorithms. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid method (BO-B&B) that combines Bayesian optimization and a branch-and-bound algorithm to deal with discrete variables. The proposed algorithm exploits the advantages of the cutting-edge machine-learning parameter-tuning technique and the exact mathematical optimization method, thereby balancing efficiency and accuracy. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms benchmarking discrete optimization heuristics for simulation-based DNDPs in terms of total computational time. Thus, BO-B&B can potentially aid decision makers in mapping practical network design schemes for large-scale networks.

This article investigates air-ground coordinated communications system, in which trajectories of air UAV base stations (UAV-BSs) and access control of ground users (GUs) are jointly optimized. We formulated this optimization problem as a mixed cooperative-competitive game, where each GU competes for the limited resources of UAV-BSs to maximize its own throughput by accessing a suitable UAV-BS, and UAV-BSs cooperate with each other and design their trajectories to maximize the defined fair throughput to improve the total throughput and keep the GU fairness. Moreover, the action space of GUs is discrete, while that of UAV-BS is continuous. To tackle this hybrid action space issue, we transform the discrete actions into continuous action probabilities and propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach, named air-ground probabilistic multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (AG-PMADDPG). With well-designed rewards, AG-PMADDPG can coordinate two types of agents, UAV-BSs and GUs, to achieve their own objectives based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that AG-PMADDPG can outperform the benchmark algorithms in terms of throughput and fairness.

Multi-swarm optimizer applied in water distribution networks	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												In the present work, a new approach is presented for the optimization of multi-modal nonlinear programming problems with constraints or a nondifferentiable objective function. The model is applied in the optimization of water distribution networks (WDN). An algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, based on multi-swarm optimization (MSO) with multiple swarms that work corporately a master swarm and several slave swarms named multi-swarm corporative particle-swarm optimizer (MSC-PSO). There are discrete and continuous decision variables and the problem can be treated as a mixed discrete nonlinear programming (MDNLP) one. The combinations of the algorithm search parameters are obtained in a simple manner, allowing viable and promising solutions. A benchmark problem from the literature is studied, in which the installation costs of a WDN are to be minimized with a computational time of 50 s. The implementation of the algorithm is proven to be efficient, with reduction in pipe installation cost up to 1.08% when compared with results from the literature. The algorithm is also implemented in a primary network, installed in the town of Esperanca Nova, Parana, Brazil, with reduction of 4.28% in the total cost when compared to the current WDN in operation. The computational time for this case was 69 s.

J	Tsai, JT				Tsai, Jinn-Tsong			Improved differential evolution algorithm for nonlinear programming and engineering design problems	NEUROCOMPUTING												An improved differential evolution algorithm (IDEA) is proposed to solve nonlinear programming and engineering design problems. The proposed IDEA combines the Taguchi method with sliding levels and a differential evolution algorithm (DEA). The DEA has a powerful global exploration capability on macrospace and uses fewer control parameters. The systematic reasoning ability of the orthogonal array with sliding level and response table is used to exploit the better individuals on microspace to be potential offspring. Therefore, the proposed IDEA is well enhanced and balanced on exploration and exploitation. In this study, the sensitivity of evolutionary parameters for the performance of the IDEA is explored, and the IDEA shows its effectiveness and robustness compared with both the DEA and the real-coded genetic algorithm. The engineering design problems usually encounter a large number of design variables, a mix type of both discrete and continuous design variables, and many design constraints. The proposed IDEA is used to solve these engineering design optimization problems, and demonstrates its capability, feasibility, and robustness. From the computational experiments, the introduced IDEA can obtain better results and more prominent performance than the methods presented in the literatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The hybrid plant dealt with is composed of two coupled subsystems, one of them being of continuous-time type while the other is digital. As a result there are also mixed continuous-time and discrete signals present in the system associated either with the solutions of differential equations which depend at the same time on both discrete-time and continuous-time forcing terms and on generalized difference equations associated with discretized and digital signals. The estimation algorithm is of a continuous-time nature since the plant parameter estimates are updated for all time. It also incorporates a relative adaptation dead-zone as a robust stabilization mechanism which prevents against instability in the presence of a common class of unmodeled dynamics and bounded noise.					de la Sen, manuel/A-8803-2008	de la Sen, manuel/0000-0001-9320-9433													1026-0226	1607-887X					2005	2005	3					299	329		10.1155/DDNS.2005.299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/DDNS.2005.299													WOS:000235731600007

This paper considers a multi-cloud radio access network (MC-RAN), where each cloud is connected to a distinct set of cache-enabled base stations (BSs) via limited capacity fronthaul links. The BSs are equipped with local cache storage and baseband processing capabilities, as a means to alleviate the fronthaul congestion problem. The paper then investigates the problem of jointly assigning users to clouds and determining their beamforming vectors so as to maximize the network-wide energy efficiency subject to fronthaul capacity and transmit power constraints. This paper solves such a mixed discrete-continuous, non-convex optimization problem using fractional programming and successive inner-convex approximation techniques to deal with the non-convexity of the continuous part of the problem, and $l_{0}$-norm approximation to account for the binary association part. A highlight of the proposed algorithm is its capability of being implemented in a distributed fashion across the multiple clouds through a reasonable amount of information exchange. The numerical simulations illustrate the pronounced role the proposed algorithm plays in improving the energy efficiency of large-scale cache-enabled MC-RANs, especially at the high interference regime.

Distillation sequences and heat integration networks are simultaneously optimized to minimize the total annual cost (TAC) of HIDiSs. First, the synthesis problem is formulated as an implicit mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Discrete variables are distillation sequences. Continuous variables include operating pressures, key component recoveries and ratios of the actual reflux ratios to the minimum reflux ratios in columns. Next, solution strategies are presented, including representing distillation sequences through a novel encoding method, randomly generating neighboring distillation sequences, automatically determining heat integration networks by the pinch method, and calculating the TAC based on shortcut design of columns. Then, the optimization problem is solved by an improved simulated annealing algorithm. Finally, correctness verification for the method is made in two case studies. The optimization algorithm is proved to be computationally efficient and capable to obtain high quality optimal solution. The results demonstrate that heat integration between columns significantly reduces the energy consumption compared to the non-integrated distillation sequences.

So far, integration of these two different modalities is a difficult process, involving many decisions concerning how best to represent the information so that it will be captured or useful, and hand-labeling large amounts of data. DeepType overcomes this challenge by explicitly integrating symbolic information into the reasoning process of a neural network with a type system. First we construct a type system, and second, we use it to constrain the outputs of a neural network to respect the symbolic structure. We achieve this by reformulating the design problem into a mixed integer problem: create a type system and subsequently train a neural network with it. In this reformulation discrete variables select which parent-child relations from an ontology are types within the type system, while continuous variables control a classifier fit to the type system. The original problem cannot he solved exactly, so we propose a 2-step algorithm: 1) heuristic search or stochastic optimization over discrete variables that define a type system informed by an Oracle and a Learnability heuristic, 2) gradient descent to fit classifier parameters. We apply DeepType to the problem of Entity Linking on three standard datasets (i.e, WikiDisamb30, CoNLL (YAGO), TAC KBP 2010) and find that it outperforms all existing solutions by a wide margin, including approaches that rely on a human-designed type system or recent deep learning-based entity embeddings, while explicitly using symbolic information lets it integrate new entities without retraining.																			2159-5399	2374-3468	978-1-57735-800-8				2018							5406	5413																WOS:000485488905062

Improving the efficiency of Cellular Automata for sewer network design optimization problems using Adaptive Refinement	12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HYDROINFORMATICS (HIC 2016) - SMART WATER FOR THE FUTURE	Procedia Engineering				12th International Conference on Hydroinformatics (HIC) - Smart Water for the Future	AUG 21-26, 2016	SOUTH KOREA	Incheon Metropolitan Govt, Korea Tourism Org, Smart Water Grid Res Grp				This paper introduces an adaptive procedure to improve the efficiency of a two phase simulation-optimization cellular automata algorithm recently proposed by the authors for the optimal design of household sewer networks. In the proposed method, the continuous decision variables are discretized to turn the original mixed-integer problem to a discrete problem which is then solved by a two-phase CA method. It is obvious that coarse discretization requires low computational effort but may lead to sub-optimal solution while fine discretization may produce better solutions at the expense of higher computational cost. An adaptive refinement approach is, therefore, proposed to reduce the computational cost of the CA method with no adverse effect on the quality of the final solution. The optimization process starts with coarse discrete values of pipes nodal elevations and the problem is solved for optimal solution. A finer discretization of the pipe nodal elevations is then constructed in the neighborhood of optimal pipes nodal elevations obtained from the first run and the same process is used to find the new solution. This process is continued until no change in the solution is possible. The proposed method is applied to solve two benchmark problems of literature. The result explicitly shows that the proposed adaptive refinement approach leads to quality solution with much reduced computational effort. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The objective is to make an optimal investment decision in order to minimize the total travel cost in the network, while accounting for the route choice behaviors of network users. Because of the computational difficulties experienced with the solution algorithm of nonlinear bi-level mixed integer programming with a large number of 0-1 variables, the discrete network design problem has been recognized as one of the most difficult yet challenging problems in transport. In this paper, at first a traditional bi-level programming model for the discrete network design problem is introduced, and then a new solution algorithm is proposed by using the support function concept to express the relationship between improvement flows and the new additional links in the existing urban network. Finally, the applications of the new algorithm are illustrated with two numerical examples. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm would be efficient in practice.

In this paper, a single-level mixed integer linear programming (SL-MILP) formulation for bi-level DNDP is presented. To cope with the dependency of node-link adjacency matrix on new links, travel time function is appropriately modified. The nonlinearity of the travel time function is also removed by means of a convex-combination based linear approximation which takes advantage of a unimodular structure. Two valid inequalities is developed which shorten computation time significantly. The validity of the proposed formulation is examined by two test problems. SL-MILP is able to provide optimal solution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, D; Zeng, P; Cui, SJ; Song, CH				Liu, Ding; Zeng, Peng; Cui, Shijie; Song, Chunhe			Deep Reinforcement Learning for Charging Scheduling of Electric Vehicles Considering Distribution Network Voltage Stability	SENSORS												The rapid development of electric vehicle (EV) technology and the consequent charging demand have brought challenges to the stable operation of distribution networks (DNs). The problem of the collaborative optimization of the charging scheduling of EVs and voltage control of the DN is intractable because the uncertainties of both EVs and the DN need to be considered. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to coordinate EV charging scheduling and distribution network voltage control. The DRL-based strategy contains two layers, the upper layer aims to reduce the operating costs of power generation of distributed generators and power consumption of EVs, and the lower layer controls the Volt/Var devices to maintain the voltage stability of the distribution network. We model the coordinate EV charging scheduling and voltage control problem in the distribution network as a Markov decision process (MDP). The model considers uncertainties of charging process caused by the charging behavior of EV users, as well as the uncertainty of uncontrollable load, system dynamic electricity price and renewable energy generation. Since the model has a dynamic state space and mixed action outputs, a framework of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is adopted to train the two-layer agent and the policy network is designed to output discrete and continuous control actions. Simulation and numerical results on the IEEE-33 bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in collaborative EV charging scheduling and distribution network voltage stabilization.

The first part defines the process synthesis problem as a mixed integer programming problem and discusses the main approaches which were used to solve it. In the discrete approach, where the operating conditions of the unit operation are fixed, combined heuristic and algorithmic procedures, such as the recent method of Simulated Annealing (SA), are promising tools. The SA procedure is illustrated by the synthesis of sharp separation sequences. In the continuous approach, the synthesis or the optimization problem is a nonlinear programming problem (NLP), where the operating conditions are optimized. Since efficient large-scale NLP codes are now available, this approach will be a great success. A recent alternative consists in merging the two previous approaches to implement large-scale Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) codes. This method has wide applications in complex process synthesis, or in model identification. An application to a network heat exchanger design and the model identification of a settling tank are given.

J	Danish, M; Kumar, S; Qamareen, A; Kumar, S				Danish, Mohd.; Kumar, Surendra; Qamareen, Arees; Kumar, Shashi			Optimal Solution of MINLP Problems Using Modified Genetic Algorithm	CHEMICAL PRODUCT AND PROCESS MODELING												Many engineering and industrial constrained optimization problems can be modeled as mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems e.g. heat and mass exchange networks, reactorseparator networks, batch plant design and scheduling, flow sheeting etc. The global optima in such problems are ill-conditioned due to the involvement of continuous and discrete variables, nonlinearities and non-convexities. This research work concerns the development of a modified GA and to apply it to find the solutions of several difficult MINLP problems. The modified GA utilizes tournament selection, SBX cross-over, polynomial mutation and variable elitism operators, along with distance based dynamic penalty with anti-distortion. The algorithm has been programmed in MATLAB. Six MINLP problems, which emerged from the optimal design of sequential multi-product batch plants, and considered as difficult ones in literature, were successfully solved. The solutions thus obtained are either comparable or better than those available in literature. The above combination of various schemes in modified GA helps in achieving faster convergence to global optimum with comparatively less violation of constraints; population size required is also less. The effect of various parameters on the convergence to global optimum has also been studied along with setting of various parameters. In future, efforts may be devoted to search proper merging strategy of quality operators for the design of a general purpose and robust GA so as to use it for a variety of engineering, specifically process engineering problems, more effectively.						qamareen, arees/0000-0002-7824-5441													1934-2659	2194-6159				MAY	2006	1	1							4	10.2202/1934-2659.1010	http://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1934-2659.1010													WOS:000214079200004

A more general version of these two classic formulations is the biobjective network design problem. This article discusses an exact solution strategy for the biobjective discrete network design problem with equilibrium constraints, which eliminates the inexactness and incompleteness deficiencies pertaining to heuristics or meta-heuristics presented in previous research. In particular, we adapted and justified a dichotomic solution framework for the biobjective network design problem, in which the complete solution set of the problem can be exhausted by repeatedly solving a parameterized scalar problem and updating the parameter set. A generalized Benders decomposition method, a widely used solution strategy for nonlinear mixed integer programming problems, is further implemented in the solution framework, which offers an efficient algorithmic tool for solution of the scalar problem. Numerical results obtained from the example problems justify the solution optimality, completeness, and efficiency of the presented solution method. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The first approach, following the continuum approximation scheme, builds upon the special case of an infinite homogeneous plane where traffic equilibrium can be described by an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this homogeneous case, sometimes in a closed form, is then used to develop approximate solutions to more general cases (e.g., those in a heterogeneous space). This model provides a computationally efficient way to obtain managerial insights and near-optimal solutions, especially for large problem instances. We also develop a more traditional discrete location model in the form of a mixed-integer program, which builds directly upon a nonlinear partial differential equation description of customer traffic equilibrium. We develop a Lagrangian relaxation based solution approach with an embedded finite-element method subroutine, to separate and solve the location decisions as well as the traffic equilibrium. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate applicability of the proposed models and to compare performance of the two complementing modeling approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lee, S; Grossmann, IE				Lee, S; Grossmann, IE			New algorithms for nonlinear generalized disjunctive programming	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) has been introduced recently as an alternative model to MINLP for representing discrete/continuous optimization problems. The basic idea of GDP consists of representing discrete decisions in the continuous space with disjunctions, and constraints in the discrete space with logic propositions. In this paper, we describe a new convex nonlinear relaxation of the nonlinear GDP problem that relies on the use of the convex hull of each of the disjunctions involving nonlinear inequalities. The proposed nonlinear relaxation is used to reformulate the GDP problem as a tight MINLP problem, and for deriving a branch and bound method. Properties of these methods are given, and the relation of this method with the logic based outer-approximation method is established.

The batch scheduling formulation is extended from the continuous Resource-Task Network (RTN) formulation which was originally proposed by Castro et al. [P.M. Castro, A.P. Barbosa-Povoa, H.A. Matos, Optimal periodic scheduling of batch plants using RTN-based discrete and continuous-time formulations: a case study approach, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 42 (2003) 3346-3360; P.M. Castro, A.P.

Besides the integrated heat recovery and short-term batch scheduling, a full set of heat-integrated periodic scheduling for batch processes, which is more useful in industrial environments, is also presented. The heat-integrated batch scheduling problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), where the new formulation can also be solved in standalone or heat-integrated modes by user's preferences. In the heat-integrated mode, the processes can be precisely defined while keeping the operation flexibility with slightly expanded model size. Two literature examples are demonstrated to show the efficiency and flexibility of the model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This non-linear model can be linearized because of the special structure achieved by the binary leader decision variables and subsequently solved by a Benders Decomposition Algorithm to global optimality. We illustrate the capability of the approach on the Discrete Network Design Problem which adds arcs to an existing road network at the leader stage and anticipates the traffic equilibrium for the follower stage. Because of the non-linear objective functions of this problem, we use a linearization method for increasing, convex and non-linear functions based on continuous variables. Numerical tests show that this algorithm can solve even large instances of Bilevel Problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mixed time delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays. An appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional put forward to reflect the mixed time-varying delays is proposed to establish sufficient conditions for the existence of admissible state estimators. The conditions are described in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which guarantee the estimation error to be globally exponentially stable in the presence of mixed time-varying delays. Then, the desired estimator matrix gain can be characterized in terms of the solution to these LMIs. A numerical example is addressed to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

Discrete and continuous variables define the capacity selections for diverse MSW technologies, and the operation of the MSW network, respectively. The economic target is considered to maximize the net present value. The environmental impact is the minimization of a normalized environmental objective function (NEOF). The social target is the maximization of jobs. An interesting feature about the research work is the requirement of biodrying technologies for MSW moisture content control. Due to the conflicted nature among the sustainability components, a multiobjective optimization (MO) is carried out to find the Pareto optimal solutions. The MO results show that the Pareto optimal solutions vary around profit range of $4.9-8.5 billion, NEOF impact range of 3.2-3.6 units, and social benefit range of 2700-4828 jobs.

This new model is meant to be supported by smart grids, electricity networks that can intelligently integrate the actions of all users connected to them-generators, consumers, and prosumers (those that do both)- to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies. A major research challenge is the design of markets for prosumers in smart grids that consider distribution grid constraints. Recently, a discrete market model has been presented that allows prosumers to trade electricity while satisfying the constraints of the grid. However, most of the times energy flow problems possess a continuous nature, and that discrete market model can only provide approximate solutions. In this paper we extend the market model to deal with continuous (piecewise linear) utility functions. We also provide a mapping that shows that the clearing of such a market can be done by means of integer linear programming.

The radio environment is showing a trend of complexity, and spectrum conflicts are becoming increasingly acute. User equipment (UE) can accurately sense and utilize spectrum resources through radio map (RM). However, the construction and dissemination of RM incur a heavy computational burden and large dissemination delay, which limit the real-time sensing of spatial spectrum situations. In this paper, we propose an RM construction and dissemination method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the context of mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. We formulate the dissemination modes selection and resource allocation problems during RM construction and dissemination as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Then, we propose an actor-critic-based joint offloading and resource allocation (ACJORA) algorithm for intelligent scheduling of computational offloading and resource allocation. We design a novel weighted loss function for the actor network, which combines the discrete actions for offloading decisions and the continuous actions for resource allocation. And the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the cost of dissemination by optimizing the offloading strategies and resources, which is more applicable for real-time RM applications in MEC networks.

Distributed multilevel optimization for complex structures	STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION					7th World Congress on Computational Mechanics	JUL 16-22, 2006	Los Angeles, CA					Optimization problems concerning complex structures with many design variables may entail an unacceptable computational cost. This problem can be reduced considerably with a multilevel approach: A structure consisting of several components is optimized as a whole (global) as well as on the component level. In this paper, an optimization method is discussed with applications in the assessment of the impact of new design considerations in the development of a structure. A strategy based on fully stressed design is applied for optimization problems in linear statics. A global model is used to calculate the interactions (e.g., loads) for each of the components. These components are then optimized using the prescribed interactions, followed by a new global calculation to update the interactions. Mixed discrete and continuous design variables as well as different design configurations are possible. An application of this strategy is presented in the form of the full optimization of a vertical tail plane center box of a generic large passenger aircraft. In linear dynamics, the parametrization of the component interactions is problematic due to the frequency dependence. Hence, a modified method is presented in which the speed of component mode synthesis is used to avoid this parametrization. This method is applied to a simple test case that originates from noise control.																			1615-147X	1615-1488				JUL	2008	36	1					71	81		10.1007/s00158-007-0173-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-007-0173-8													WOS:000256087600007

For machine learning applications in buildings, often the sensor data is augmented with several other artificial variables or metadata corresponding to building components including the occupants. Above datasets are usually organized in the form of a table with rows and columns, and inherently comprise a mix of continuous and discrete (nominal, ordinal) features/columns, thus are called tabular datasets. A vast majority of smart building datasets are tabular in nature. Machine learning algorithms, especially deep neural networks are generally designed as smooth function approximators, and hence are difficult to train optimally with tabular data without appropriate pre-processing. In this work, we analyze the challenges faced by conventional methods for tabular data pre-processing, and propose the use of two improved data transformation methods, namely variational dequantization (for discrete features), and mode-specific normalization (for continuous features). We showimproved thermal preference classification performance for two key thermal comfort datasets with the proposed pre-processing. Since the methods are designed in a generalizable way to work for any tabular dataset, we envision them to be an integral part of machine learning algorithm development pipeline for a plethora of smart building applications.																					978-1-4503-9890-9				2022							168	177		10.1145/3563357.3564072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3563357.3564072													WOS:001066191100018

The customers can be pedestrians, drones, or any autonomous vehicles that do not have to travel via fixed channels to access a service facility. Analytical models are developed to evaluate the expected performance of a facility location design across an exponential number of facility disruption scenarios. In each of these scenarios, customers travel to a functioning facility through a continuous space, and their destination and path choices under traffic equilibrium are described by a class of partial differential equation (PDE). A closed-form solution to the PDE is derived in an explicit matrix form, and this paper shows how the traffic equilibrium patterns across all facility disruption scenarios can be evaluated in a polynomial time. These new analytical results are then incorporated into continuous and discrete optimization frameworks for facility location design. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the computational performance of the proposed modeling framework.																			0191-2615	1879-2367				NOV	2022	165						123	140		10.1016/j.trb.2022.09.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2022.09.005		OCT 2022											WOS:000873780500003

In this paper, we investigate a multi-user communication system assisted by cooperative IRS devices with the capability of energy harvesting. Aiming to maximize the long-term average achievable system rate, an optimization problem is formulated by jointly designing the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) and discrete phase shift beamforming at the IRSs, with the constraints on transmit power, user data rate requirement and IRS energy buffer size. Considering time-varying channels and stochastic arrivals of energy harvested by the IRSs, we first formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and then develop a novel multi-agent Q-mix (MAQ) framework with two layers to decouple the optimization parameters. The higher layer is for optimizing phase shift resolutions, and the lower one is for phase shift beamforming and power allocation. Since the phase shift optimization is an integer programming problem with a large-scale action space, we improve MAQ by incorporating the Wolpertinger method, namely, MAQ-WP algorithm to achieve a sub-optimality with reduced dimensions of action space. In addition, as MAQ-WP is still of high complexity to achieve good performance, we propose a policy gradient-based MAQ algorithm, namely, MAQ-PG, by mapping the discrete phase shift actions into a continuous space at the cost of a slight performance loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MAQ-WP and MAQ-PG algorithms can converge faster and achieve data rate improvements of 10.7% and 8.8% over the conventional multi-agent DDPG, respectively.

Stochastic fluid network models can considerably speed up the simulation of complex flow networks, such as high-speed packet-based telecommunications networks, where traditional queueing-based simulation routinely gives rise to enormous numbers of events. Furthermore, they are also amenable to fast, nonparametric, and unbiased estimation (unlike traditional queueing) of IPA (Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis) gradients (derivatives of performance measures with respect to various parameters), which may be used to make decisions on network design, replenishment, management or control.

Both the uncertainties of system and the sensor nonlinearity are considered to be randomly occurring which are governed by a set of Bernoulli distributed white sequences. Since inaccuracies or uncertainties may occur in the designed state estimator and the complete mode synchronization between plant and state estimator is hardly possible, a non-fragile asynchronous state estimator design method is presented.

The structural variables as the discrete variables are optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA), whereas continuous variables are handled by a modified quasi-linear programming (MQLP) model. Each HEN is considered as a chromosome consisting of a sequence of genes. Each gene also contains the address of the exchanger(s) in the network. The HENs generated by the GA are sent to the MQLP to calculate their overall objective function (OOF) (i.e. minimum total annual cost (TAC)). The MQLP model includes two inner and outer surfaces. On the outer surface, the local optimal values of the continuous variables are found according to the maximum energy recovery of HEN, while on the inner surface, the globally optimal values of them are found to reach the minimum TAC of HEN. Due to the relatively linear behavior of the proposed method, a comparison of results with references showed that this method can reduce TAC of HENs compared to the studied references by about (0.51% to 2.37%).

Previous studies mostly concentrate on the continuous-time teleoperation systems and neglect the management of significant practical phenomena, such as data-swap, the effect of sampling rates of samplers, and refresh rates of actuators on the system's stability. A multi-rate sampling approach is proposed in this study, given the isolation of the master and slave robots in teleoperation systems which may have different hardware restrictions. This architecture collects data through numerous sensors with various sampling rates, assuming that a continuous-time controller stabilizes a linear teleoperation system. The aim is to assign each position and velocity signals to sensors with different sampling rates and divide the state vector between sensors to guarantee the stability of the resulting multi-rate sampled-data teleoperation system. Sufficient Krasovskii-based conditions will be provided to preserve the exponential stability of the system. This problem will be transformed into a mixed-integer program with LMIs (linear matrix inequalities). These conditions are also used to design the observers for the multi-rate teleoperation systems whose estimation errors converge exponentially to the origin. The results are validated by numerical simulations which are useful in designing sensor networks for teleoperation systems.

Multi-commodity <i>k</i>-splittable survivable network design problems with relays	TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS												The network design problem is a well known optimization problem with applications in telecommunication, infrastructure designs and military operations. This paper devises the first formulation and solution methodology for the multi-commodity k-splittable two-edge disjoint survivable network design problem with capacitated edges and relays. This problem realistically portrays telecommunications network design but has not been solved previously due to its computational difficulty. Edge capacity is considered as either a discrete or a continuous variable. An exact method and a practical heuristic method are presented, and computational results are discussed.

Integration of discrete-event simulation and optimization for the design of value networks	16TH EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS ENGINEERING AND 9TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING	Computer-Aided Chemical Engineering				Joint Conference Event of the 9th Symposium on Process Systems Engineering (PSE 2006)/16th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE-16)	JUL 09-13, 2006	Garmisch-Partenkirchen, GERMANY					The design and restructuring of value networks in the process industry requires decision making in a space of numerous diverse constraints. A mathematical problem description leads to dynamic models involving continuous and discrete decision variables; further-more, stochastic effects have to be taken into account. Instead of formulating an overall optimization problem, which would cover all possible decision variables at the price of being difficult to formulate and impossible to solve, we employ an approach based on discrete-event simulation. Mathematical optimization is rather applied to dedicated subproblems, such as planning, scheduling and resource allocation. The benefits of using optimization of subproblems arising in the discrete-event simulation of value networks are discussed in this contribution.																			1570-7946		978-0-444-52969-5				2006	21						1955	1960																WOS:000287727700315
J	Mohri, SS; Akbarzadeh, M				Mohri, Seyed Sina; Akbarzadeh, Meisam			Locating key stations of a metro network using bi-objective programming: discrete and continuous demand mode	PUBLIC TRANSPORT												This study proposes two bi-objective optimization problems for locating key stations of a metro network in both discrete and continuous demand modes. Traditionally, designing a metro network based on optimization techniques consists of two approaches. The first approach locates a number of alignments and their stations simultaneously, while the second approach involves locating key stations, designing a core network, and locating secondary stations. In locating key stations processed by a single objective model, the number of produced and attracted trips to the key stations is maximized. This paper considers a second objective for this stage to maximize the coverage of key stations on origin/destination (OD) trips. A fuzzy goal programming model is established to solve the bi-objective model and provide some Pareto-optimal solutions. The previous single objective model and the proposed model with continuous demand mode are applied to a real network. Results show that the proposed model significantly increases the coverage of key stations on OD trips with only a slight reduction in the number of produced and attracted trips.

J	Chen, JL; Pu, ZY; Zheng, N; Wen, X; Ding, HL; Guo, XC				Chen, Junlan; Pu, Ziyuan; Zheng, Nan; Wen, Xiao; Ding, Hongliang; Guo, Xiucheng			A novel generative adversarial network for improving crash severity modeling with imbalanced data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												Traffic crash data is often greatly imbalanced with the majority of non -fatal crashes and only a small number of fatal crashes. Such data imbalance issue poses a challenge for crash severity modelling, especially for classifying and interpreting fatal crashes with very limited samples. To address the data imbalance issues, the data resampling techniques are commonly used methods to rebalance the number of samples among all categories of the dataset, such as under -sampling and over -sampling techniques. However, it is challenging for most traditional and existing deep learning -based resampling methods, e.g., synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to handle both continuous and discrete risk factors in traffic crash datasets, since they are built upon by smooth and continuous functions which are not applicable for processing discrete variables. Though some resampling methods are capable of handling both continuous and discrete variables, they may struggle with mode collapse issues associated with sparse discrete risk factors so that the diversity of the underlying data distribution can not be captured due to oversampling repetitive and similar samples. To address the aforementioned issues, the current study proposes a traffic crash data generation method based on the Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN) to rebalance crash datasets for improving performance of crash severity classification and interpretation. The designed experiments are conducted to evaluate contributions of the synthetic data for improving crash severity classification, the distribution consistency between synthetic and benchmark datasets, and the parameter recovery (i. e., the accuracy of parameter estimation and probability prediction) for various resampling strategies. A 4 -year real -world dataset collected in Washington State, U.S., and Monte Carlo simulations are utilized for demonstrating the designed experiments. The results indicate that crash severity modeling using synthetic data generated by the mix-resampling of CTGAN and random under -sampling (CTGAN-RU) outperforms all baseline methods. In addition, the proposed deep generative method demonstrates the capability in maintaining distribution consistency and achieving accurate parameter recovery. This study can provide valuable insights for traffic safety researchers and engineers into crash severity modeling, especially when handling imbalanced crash data of various types.																			0968-090X	1879-2359				JUL	2024	164								104642	10.1016/j.trc.2024.104642	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2024.104642													WOS:001244026900001

J	Kan, X; Shu, HS; Li, ZN				Kan, Xiu; Shu, Huisheng; Li, Zhenna			Robust state estimation for discrete-time neural networks with mixed time-delays, linear fractional uncertainties and successive packet dropouts	NEUROCOMPUTING												This paper is concerned with the robust state estimation problem for a class of discrete-time delayed neural networks with linear fractional uncertainties (LFUs) and successive packet dropouts (SPDs). The mixed time delays (MTDs) consisting of both discrete time-delays and infinite distributed delays enter into the model of the addressed neural networks. A Bernoulli distributed white sequence with a known conditional probability is introduced to govern the random occurrence of the SPDs. The main purpose of the problem under consideration is to design a state estimator such that the dynamics of the estimation error is globally asymptotically stable in the mean square. By using stochastic analysis and Lyapunov stability theory, the desired state estimator is designed to be robust against LFUs and SPDs.

Mathematical models for selection of optimal place and size of connections considering the time-value of money	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												In this study, mathematical models to select the optimal place and size of connections are studied considering the time-value of money. A connection is defined as a part that links different sets of departments through which some interdepartmental material flows must go [S. Huang, R. Batta, R.

However, most of the existing trust models rely on evaluating vehicles or data at the application level. For selfish or forgery attacks in intelligent vehicle networks, we propose a trusted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) cybersecurity approach for computation offloading to evaluate the safety and reliability performance in IoT edge networks, including our intelligent system model and a Deep Policy Gradient Action Quantization (DPGAQ) scheme. By introducing a reputation record table and designing a highly decisive communication trusted computing mode, we can accurately predict the untrusted selfish attack of vehicle in the task offloading of the Internet of things. Furthermore, in the multi-vehicle scenario, because the trusted offloading decision is a mixed integer programming problem, which leads to the dimension explosion of channel state and space, we propose a joint action-value quantization with attention mechanism to approximate the continuous actions values to a limited number of discrete values. Because it is not only inefficient but also unnecessary to generate high-dimensional decision actions in each time frame, we prune the infeasible action decisions by order preserving pruning to reduce the computational complexity of training and achieve efficient training on the premise of ensuring accuracy. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, millions of channels of edge vehicle networks are used as the input data. The simulation results show that compared with the benchmark trust model, DPGAQ achieves more than 72% reputation level, and improves 11%, 10% and 11% respectively in precision, recall and F-score.

To reduce transmission of signals in the limited bandwidth networks, a novel event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed. A networked singular Markovian jump filtering error system (FES) with time-delay is established by considering the network communication characteristic and the ETS. By utilizing Lyapunov-Kravoskii stability theory, some new criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such that the FES is stochastically admissible (SA) and has a prescribed level of mixed H-infinity and passive performance. The co-design method is given, which can realize the synchronous design for the filter and ETS parameters. The proposed method can deal with the mode-dependent or mode-independent filter design problems for SMJSs including H-infinity passive and mixed filter (i.e., mixed H-infinity and passive filter) in a unified form.

A GERMS model simulator was developed that insured that the rate of events depended only on the current state of model. Results: The confidence intervals of long-term averages of infection level in simulated GERMS models were shown to contain the deterministic model means. Conclusion: GERMS models provide a convenient framework for testing the sensitivity of model-based decisions to a variety of unrealistic assumptions that are characteristic of differential equation models. GERMS especially facilitates making more realistic assumptions about contact patterns in geographic and social space.																			0148-5717	1537-4521				NOV	2000	27	10					617	626		10.1097/00007435-200011000-00010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00007435-200011000-00010								11099077					WOS:000165337300010
J	Gokbayrak, K				Gokbayrak, Kagan			A two-level off-grid electric distribution problem on the continuous space	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												We introduce a two-level distribution network design problem to serve a set of demand points. At the higher level, primary facilities with source capabilities feed secondary facilities over tree networks. At the lower level, both the primary and secondary facilities serve customers within a coverage distance over star networks. The problem has wide applications especially in the spatial planning of energy distribution networks, where the coverage distance constraints may be associated with the loss of electric power over distance. The facilities can be located anywhere on the continuous space in our greenfield development problem. We formulate an optimization problem that determines the number, types, and locations of the facilities as well as the lower and higher-level networks to minimize a distribution cost. We also propose a heuristic solution method that solves a discrete counterpart and then improves its solution by moving facilities around on the continuous space. When the number of demand points is large, the discrete counterpart is also hard to solve. Therefore, we propose a decomposition method for its solution: We first solve a decentralized single-level problem with secondary facilities and then form the higher-level network. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of our discrete problem decomposition and facility location adjustments on the continuous space.

J	Bu, XW				Bu, Xiangwei			Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Control of Non-Strict Feedback Nonaffine Dynamic Systems	IEEE ACCESS												The most focuses of the existing actor-critic reinforcement learning control (ARLC) are on dealing with continuous affine systems or discrete nonaffine systems. In this paper, I propose a new ARLC method for continuous nonaffine dynamic systems subject to unknown dynamics and external disturbances. A new input-to-state stable system is developed to establish an augmented dynamic system, from which I further get a strict-feedback affine model that is convenient for control designing based on a model transformation approach. The Nussbaum function is connected with a fuzzy approximation to devise an actor network whose tracking performance is further enhanced via strengthening signals generated by a fuzzy critic network. The stability of the closed-loop control system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov synthesis. Finally, the comparison simulation results are presented to verify the design.

The missing measurements are modeled as a linear function of the stochastic variable satisfying Bernoulli random binary distribution, while the quantized measured output signals are considered by using the logarithmic quantization. The purpose of this paper is to design a filter such that, for the mixed delays and unreliable communication channel, the filtering error system is asymptotically mean square stable, and the H-infinity filtering performance index is satisfied. A sufficient condition for the solvability of the problem is derived, and the filter parameters are designed by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to show the usefulness of the designed filtering method.

Hidden Symmetries in Acoustic Wave Systems	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS												Latent symmetries are hidden symmetries which become manifest by performing a reduction of a given discrete system into an effective lower-dimensional one. We show how latent symmetries can be leveraged for continuous wave setups in the form of acoustic networks. These are systematically designed to possess latent-symmetry induced pointwise amplitude parity between selected waveguide junctions for all low frequency eigenmodes. We develop a modular principle to interconnect latently symmetric networks to feature multiple latently symmetric junction pairs. By connecting such networks to a mirror symmetric subsystem, we design asymmetric setups featuring eigenmodes with domain-wise parity. Bridging the gap between discrete and continuous models, our work takes a pivotal step towards exploiting hidden geometrical symmetries in realistic wave setups.

Flowsheet generation through hierarchical reinforcement learning and graph neural networks	AICHE JOURNAL												Process synthesis experiences a disruptive transformation accelerated by artificial intelligence. We propose a reinforcement learning algorithm for chemical process design based on a state-of-the-art actor-critic logic. Our proposed algorithm represents chemical processes as graphs and uses graph convolutional neural networks to learn from process graphs. In particular, the graph neural networks are implemented within the agent architecture to process the states and make decisions. We implement a hierarchical and hybrid decision-making process to generate flowsheets, where unit operations are placed iteratively as discrete decisions and corresponding design variables are selected as continuous decisions. We demonstrate the potential of our method to design economically viable flowsheets in an illustrative case study comprising equilibrium reactions, azeotropic separation, and recycles. The results show quick learning in discrete, continuous, and hybrid action spaces. The method is predestined to include large action-state spaces and an interface to process simulators in future research.					; Schweidtmann, Artur M./W-7428-2019	Stops, Laura/0000-0001-8827-5145; Leenhouts, Roel/0000-0002-9873-8657; Schweidtmann, Artur M./0000-0001-8885-6847													0001-1541	1547-5905				JAN	2023	69	1								10.1002/aic.17938	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aic.17938		NOV 2022											WOS:000884897200001

Such scenarios arise in networked and embedded systems, where several applications share a set of limited and varying resources. Technically, the toolbox evaluates the time-varying state covariance of a mixed continuous/discrete linear system driven by white noise. It also integrates a quadratic cost function for the system. The passing of time and the updating of the discrete-time systems are explicitly managed by the user in a simulation run. Since the timing is completely handled by the user, any complex timing scenario can be analyzed, including adaptive scheduling and reconfiguration between different system modes. Three examples of how the toolbox can be used to evaluate the control performance of such time-varying systems are given.

The key point of this estimation method is the design of three reconstructions and an event-triggered reduced-order discrete-time Luenberger observer (E-RODL-O). First, Reconstruction I compensates for the effects of event-triggered sampling. Based on Reconstruction I, the E-RODL-O is designed for obtaining a periodic sampled delayed system state. Then, Reconstruction II makes up for the influences of time delays, which brings the periodic sampled undelayed system state. Based on this, Reconstruction III finally calculates the continuous-time undelayed system state. Through some parameters selections, the stability of E-PCO system is guaranteed. The theoretical design is applied to a networked visual servoing mobile cart system for verifying its validity.

Probabilistic modeling of flexible pavement performance and LCC - based service lives with failure distributions	LIFE-CYCLE OF STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS: DESIGN, ASSESSMENT, MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT					FOURTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON LIFE-CYCLE CIVIL ENGINEERING	NOV 16-19, 2014	TOKYO, JAPAN					The long - term pavement performance of flexible pavements depends on a variety of generally known factors such as mix design, layer thickness, weather conditions and traffic loading. Common pavement performance models are usually based on regression approaches leading to deterministic average performance functions or computed discrete condition-based Markov transition probabilities in discrete or continuous time. However, these approaches have a number of shortcomings that are addressed shortly in the paper. Instead of using these approaches a new stochastic continuous time and state space process is introduced allowing a much more accurate description of any ageing system with continuous condition development and failure/condition distribution over time. In addition, the presented approach allows a survival analysis taking into account already failed/replaced sections, providing a condition based remaining service live of all surviving sections. Furthermore, the calculation of stochastic condition development with measures together with the resulting costs are provided allowing accurate calculations both on project and network level. Finally, the results of an application of this approach to real data from condition surveys from LTPP (USA) are provided.

An advanced discrete-time RNN for handling discrete time-varying matrix inversion: Form model design to disturbance-suppression analysis	CAAI TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY												Time-varying matrix inversion is an important field of matrix research, and lots of research achievements have been obtained. In the process of solving time-varying matrix inversion, disturbances inevitably exist, thus, a model that can suppress disturbance while solving the problem is required. In this paper, an advanced continuous-time recurrent neural network (RNN) model based on a double integral RNN design formula is proposed for solving continuous time-varying matrix inversion, which has incomparable disturbance-suppression property. For digital hardware applications, the corresponding advanced discrete-time RNN model is proposed based on the discretisation formulas. As a result of theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that the advanced continuous-time RNN model and the corresponding advanced discrete-time RNN model have global and exponential convergence performance, and they are excellent for suppressing different disturbances. Finally, inspiring experiments, including two numerical experiments and a practical experiment, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the advanced discrete-time RNN model for solving discrete time-varying matrix inversion with disturbance-suppression.

J	Shiono, N; Suzuki, H				Shiono, Naoshi; Suzuki, Hisatoshi			Optimal pipe-sizing problem of tree-shaped gas distribution networks	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												This study addresses the optimal pipe-sizing problem of a tree-shaped gas distribution network with a single supply source. An algorithm was developed with the aim of minimizing the investment for constructing a gas distribution network with a tree-shaped layout in which demands are fixed. The construction cost is known to depend on the pipe diameters used for each arc in the network. However, under the assumption that pipe diameters are continuous, we prove that it is possible to obtain the minimum construction cost directly and analytically by an iterating procedure that converts the original tree into a single equivalent arc. In addition, we also show that expanding the converted single arc inversely to the original tree computes the optimal continuous pipe diameter for each arc. Following this, we present an additional heuristic to convert optimal continuous pipe diameters into approximate discrete pipe diameters. The algorithms were evaluated by applying them to sample networks. The numerical results obtained by comparing the approximate discrete diameters with the optimal discrete diameters confirm the efficiency of our algorithms, thereby demonstrating their suitability for designing real gas distribution networks.

OFDM is a promising technology for next-generation optical networks to support high capacity and heterogeneity in network traffic by having flexible bandwidth allocation per wavelength. Another paradigm for supporting traffic heterogeneity and high bandwidth demands is mixed-line-rate (MLR) networks where wavelengths can have discrete capacities of 10/40/100 Gbps which are single carrier based. In this study, we compare the energy efficiency of an OFDM-based network versus a MLR network. We formulate mixed integer linear program (MILP) models to design energy-efficient MLR and OFDM-based networks with two scenarios: (1) with fixed average traffic per source-destination pair of the network, and (2) with uncertainties in the traffic that an actual network may have. For scenario (2), we employ a robust optimization technique which is called Gamma-robust optimization. Our results show that OFDM outperforms MLR in terms of energy efficiency especially when the traffic in the network takes random peaks in some of the links.

J	Li, YK; Shen, SP				Li, Yongkun; Shen, Shiping			Pseudo almost periodic synchronization of Clifford-valued fuzzy cellular neural networks with time-varying delays on time scales	ADVANCES IN DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS												At present, the research on discrete-time Clifford-valued neural networks is rarely reported. However, the discrete-time neural networks are an important part of the neural network theory. Because the time scale theory can unify the study of discrete- and continuous-time problems, it is not necessary to separately study continuous- and discrete-time systems. Therefore, to simultaneously study the pseudo almost periodic oscillation and synchronization of continuous- and discrete-time Clifford-valued neural networks, in this paper, we consider a class of Clifford-valued fuzzy cellular neural networks on time scales. Based on the theory of calculus on time scales and the contraction fixed point theorem, we first establish the existence of pseudo almost periodic solutions of neural networks. Then, under the condition that the considered network has pseudo almost periodic solutions, by designing a novel state-feedback controller and using reduction to absurdity, we obtain that the drive-response structure of Clifford-valued fuzzy cellular neural networks on time scales with pseudo almost periodic coefficients can realize the global exponential synchronization. Finally, we give a numerical example to illustrate the feasibility of our results.																			1687-1847					OCT 21	2020	2020	1							593	10.1186/s13662-020-03041-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13662-020-03041-w													WOS:000586682200002

We present a variational inequality (VI) formulation to describe the user equilibrium (UE) state of gasoline vehicles (GVs) and electric vehicles (EVs). Based on the mixed-UE model, a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) model is formulated for integrating the decisions of deploying EV charging stations (EVCSs) and adding new links to minimize the total travel cost (TTC) of all vehicles. A modified genetic algorithm is developed to tackle the MPEC model with an adaptive path generation procedure to address the mixed-UE model. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to identify the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms. Specifically, we propose a two-step optimization model and explore a performance comparison between the joint and two-step optimization approaches, while the joint optimization exhibits superiority in minimizing the TTC.

Computing optimal control policies based on the resulting regression models, however, is a challenging task because of the nonlinearity and nonconvexity of deep learning architectures. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a linearizable approach to design optimal control policies based on deep learning models for handling both continuous and discrete action spaces. When using piecewise linear activation functions, one can construct an equivalent representation of recurrent neural networks in terms of a set of mixed-integer linear constraints. That in turn means that the optimal control problem reduces to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which can then be solved using off-the-shelf MILP optimization solvers. Numerical experiments on standard reinforcement learning benchmarks attest to the good performance of the proposed approach.																			0743-1619	2378-5861	979-8-3503-2806-6				2023							100	105		10.23919/ACC55779.2023.10155810	http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/ACC55779.2023.10155810													WOS:001027160300014

In this article, we formulate the utility optimization problems of the CUPS-based RAN slicing system and propose a Lyapunov-based deep reinforcement learning (L-DRL) framework to solve them. Specifically, we propose that the control plane (CP) and user plane (UP) slices should control their respective power and subcarrier resources. First, we provide coverage-driven slices in the CP for coverage control and data-driven slices in the UP for diverse user requests, where we consider the influence of coverage-driven slices on data-driven slices. Second, we define the system's utilities as income minus cost, and we formulate the utility maximization problem of the UP as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is NP-hard because it considers both continuous actions (densities deployment and power allocation) and discrete action (subcarrier allocation). Furthermore, we design an alternating optimization method for the CP and UP based on the densities of deployment. Finally, we develop a novel L-DRL framework for mixed-action optimization problems and propose a specific Lyapunov-based asynchronous advantage actor-critic (L-A3C) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed Lyapunov-based A3C (L-A3C) algorithm outperforms the standard A3C algorithm in terms of the convergence while achieving higher performance than Lyapunov optimization. Moreover, our proposed CUPS-based RAN slicing scheme surpasses the benchmark RAN slicing schemes in terms of the achievable rate and delay.

A non-fragile controller is designed and an observer is constructed to estimate the state vectors of the system under consideration. In particular, the gain fluctuations occur in a random manner obeying the Bernoulli distribution. The key intent of this work is to design a non-fragile controller so that the addressed network is asymptotically synchronised in the sense of mean-square under H-infinity attenuation performance. By resorting to the stochastic analysis technique and the theory of Lyapunov stability, the required stability criteria are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities(LMIs).

Based on the problems encountered in application, the paper investigates the defects of WNN. It points out that the characteristics of activation functions of the continuous WNN and the back-propagation (BP) neural network have great differences, while the current continuous WNN uses the random initialization and back-propagation algorithm of BP network. Thus the continuous WNN has poor convergence performance. Referring to the design method of discrete WNN and signal edge detection and reconstruction theory, the paper proposes a design and initialization algorithm for single-input single-output continuous WNN. The novel algorithm utilizes the known data to search the modulus maxima of wavelet transform, then the number of hidden nodes and the initial parameters of continuous WNN can be obtained, which speeds up the training process as well as improves the convergence performance. Case study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.																					0-7803-8610-8				2004							897	901																WOS:000228358505164

These representations are used to render mixed-variable analog circuit sizing problems as continuous ones and to apply a low-budget black box Bayesian optimization (BO) variant to solve them. By transforming the initial search spaces into continuous-valued ones, the BO's Gaussian process models (GPs), which typically operate on real-valued spaces, can be used to guide the optimization search towards the global optimum. The proposed Device Representation Learning approach involves using device simulation data and training a composite model of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a dense Neural Network. The latent variables of the trained VAE model serve as the representations of the integrated device and replace the discrete-valued parametrizations of particular devices.

We assume that there are two important factors for successful SAO: one is parameter adjustment for good approximation, and the other is to find the unexplored regions for global approximation. The authors propose a simple estimate of the width in the Gaussian kernel for good approximation. In addition, in order to find the unexplored region, we develop a density function that, with the simple estimate of the width, works well in the case of continuous design variables. However, a simple application of the density function to discrete design variables often leads to the wrong result. In order to find the unexplored region of the discrete design variables with our density function, the permutation number is introduced. The density function with the permutation number can find out the unexplored region. As the result, the discrete optimum can find with a small number of function evaluations. The validity of proposed approach is examined by studying typical numerical examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Synthesis of cost-optimal heat exchanger networks using differential evolution	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Heat exchanger network synthesis (HENS) has been one of the most-studied problems in process synthesis. Nevertheless, the complexity of the HENS problem provides enough scope for the development of novel algorithms involving the application of specialized optimization techniques. Evolutionary algorithms (EA) have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional methods for optimizing functions of both continuous and discrete variables. Differential evolution (DE) is one such evolutionary algorithm that promises simple, fast and robust optimization. The present study illustrates the application of this novel technique for the synthesis of heat exchanger networks. The HENS model proposed here considers stream splitting, does away with the simplifying assumption of isothermal mixing of the split streams and has the capability to handle compulsory and forbidden matching of streams. The DE-based model (DEM) does not rely on the decomposition of the problem into subproblems but employs a simultaneous method of approach to optimize the structure of the network of heat exchangers, the heat loads of these exchangers, the split stream heat flows and the minimum approach temperature. The proposed model has been applied to some case studies available in the literature and the results of these studies are very encouraging. The present work represents thus a step forward in the search for robust and efficient global optimization algorithms for the solution of the HENS problem. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An integer linear programming model proposal	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING												In this paper, an optimization model is formulated for designing an integrated forward and reverse logistics network in the consumer goods industry. The resultant model is a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP). The objective is to minimize the total costs of the closed-loop supply chain network. It is important to note that the design of the logistics network may involve a trade-off between the total costs and the optimality in commercial goods management. The model comprises a discrete set as potential locations of unlimited capacity warehouses and fixed locations of customers' zones. It provides decisions related to the facility location and customers' requirements satisfaction, all of this related with the inventory and shipment decisions of the supply chain.

J	Hung, KL; Bensaou, B				Hung, Ka-Lok; Bensaou, Brahim			Throughput optimization in wireless local networks with inter-AP interference via a joint-association control, rate control, and contention resolution	AD HOC NETWORKS												The dense deployment of wireless access points (APs) either in wireless local area networks (WLANs) or in wireless mesh networks facilitates greatly ubiquitous Internet access, however, due to the limited number of orthogonal frequency channels allotted to the IEEE802.11-based networks, this also induces the inevitable problem of inter-AP interference. In this paper, we study the problem of determining the optimal association in multi-cell or extended wireless networks in the presence of hidden terminals and inter-AP collisions. Unlike most previous work in this area, which deals with networks without inter-AP interference, we first reveal that association control alone is not sufficient to achieve fair throughput allocation and load balancing across APs, then advocate a solution based on the joint association control, rate control and fair contention resolution as a means to improving network performance. Based on this, we formulate a cross-layer association control, throughput optimization and contention resolution problem whose objective is to allocate downlink throughput according to the proportional fairness principle. As the problem turns out to be a non-convex mixed integer programming problem, known to be NP-hard, we relax it first into a continuous problem, then transform the resultant into a convex problem and finally propose a distributed algorithm to solve it. We then design a simple yet effective approximation algorithm to recover an optimal solution that fulfills the discrete integral association constraints. The algorithm yields the optimal association, the maximum achievable rate for each downlink flow as well as each AP's optimal average backoff time. Using these results as settings in a network, we can achieve the optimal operation point without any scheduling. Numerical experiments and simulation results show that our algorithm converges rapidly and works effectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Roy, T; Barman, S				Roy, Tanusree; Barman, Soma			A behavioral study of healthy and cancer genes by modeling electrical network	GENE												In recent years, gene network modeling is gaining popularity in genomics to monitor the activity profile of genes. More specifically, the objective of the network modeling concept is to study the genetic behavior associated with disease. Previous researchers have designed network model at nucleotide level which produces more complexity for designing circuits mostly in case of gene expression studies. Whereas the authors have designed the present network model, based on amino acid level which is simpler as well as more appropriate for prediction of the genetic abnormality. In the present concept, SISO continuous and discrete system models of genes are realized using Foster network. The model is designed based on hydropathy index value of amino acids to study the biological system behavior. The time and phase response in continuous (s) domain and pole-zero distribution in discrete (z) domain are used as measurement metric in the present study. The simulated responses of the system show genetic instability for cancer genes which truly reflects the medical reports. The proposed modeling concept can be used, to accurately identify or separate out the diseased genes from healthy genes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hybrid Bayesian network classifiers: Application to species distribution models	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Bayesian networks are one of the most powerful tools in the design of expert systems located in an uncertainty framework. However, normally their application is determined by the discretization of the continuous variables. In this paper the naive Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) models are developed. They are based on Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials (MTE) designed to deal with discrete and continuous variables in the same network simultaneously without any restriction. The aim is to characterize the habitat of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca), using several continuous environmental variables, and one discrete (binary) variable representing the presence or absence of the tortoise. These models are compared with the full discrete models and the results show a better classification rate for the continuous one. Therefore, the application of continuous models instead of discrete ones avoids loss of statistical information due to the discretization. Moreover, the results of the TAN continuous model show a more spatially accurate distribution of the tortoise. The species is located in the Donana Natural Park, and in semiarid habitats. The proposed continuous models based on MTEs are valid for the study of species predictive distribution modelling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Marshal			Dissipativity based repetitive control for switched stochastic dynamical systems	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION												This paper addresses the issues of dissipativity analysis and repetitive control synthesis for a class of switched stochastic dynamical systems with time-varying delay. By using the lifting technique, the considered one dimensional model is converted into a continuous-discrete stochastic two dimensional delayed model to describe the control and learning actions of the repetitive controller. By employing stochastic system theory together with Lyapunov function technique, a new set of sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is established such that the switched stochastic system in two dimensional delayed model is mean square asymptotically stable and (Q, S, R)-dissipative. Then, the desired repetitive controller is designed by solving a convex optimization problem established in terms of LMIs. More precisely, repetitive controllers with H-infinity, passivity and mixed H-infinity and passivity performances can be obtained as the special cases for the considered system. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the developed design technique. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, JF; Huang, YM; Wang, YH; Ma, GW				Zhang, Junfei; Huang, Yimiao; Wang, Yuhang; Ma, Guowei			Multi-objective optimization of concrete mixture proportions using machine learning and metaheuristic algorithms	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS												For the optimization of concrete mixture proportions, multiple objectives (e.g., strength, cost, slump) with many variables (e.g., concrete components) under highly nonlinear constraints need to be optimized simultaneously. The current single-objective optimization models are not applicable to multi-objective optimization (MOO). This study proposes an MOO method based on machine learning (ML) and metaheuristic algorithms to optimize concrete mixture proportions. First, the performances of different ML models in the prediction of concrete objectives are compared on data sets collected from the published literature. The winner is selected as the objective function for the optimization procedure. In the optimization step, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize mixture proportions to achieve optimal objectives. The results show that the backpropagation neural network has better performance on continuous data (e.g., strength), whereas the random forest algorithm has higher prediction accuracy on more discrete data (e.g., slump). The Pareto fronts of a bi-objective mixture optimization problem for high-performance concrete and a tri-objective mixture optimization problem for plastic concrete are successfully obtained by the MOO model. The MOO model can serve as a design guide to facilitate decision-making before the construction phase. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In practice, the transportation network may comprise of multiple local regions, which are independently and separately managed by local transportation administrative authorities with different objectives. Therefore, it is possible that local authorities may act with different behaviours, either cooperatively or competitively, in designing transportation networks.

J	Shen, YY; Luo, WR; Wang, SQ; Huang, XX				Shen, Yanyan; Luo, Weiran; Wang, Shuqiang; Huang, Xiaoxia			Average AoI minimization for data collection in UAV-enabled IoT backscatter communication systems with the finite blocklength regime	AD HOC NETWORKS												Thanks to the autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), UAV-enabled data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks has become a key application for the next generation communication network. In this paper, we consider a scenario where an UAV is responsible for collecting data from sensor equipments (SEs) one by one and finally carrying the collected data to the computation center for processing. Different from the commonly used assumption that SEs always generate data at the beginning of each time slot, it is assumed that SEs can generate data at any instant during one time slot, which is more practical. Since SEs are energy limited, they upload data to the UAV by adopting backscatter communication technology to reduce energy consumption. Meanwhile, the updated information usually contains a small number of information bits but requires low latency and high reliability, thus the finite blocklength regime in ultra-reliable and low-latency communication is adopted for SEs' data transmission to the UAV. To keep the freshness of the updated information, a joint resource allocation problem including data collection time allocation, transmission power and trajectory design of the UAV is formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of all SEs. The formulated problem mixes discrete and continuous variables, which makes it difficult to solve. Thereby, we decompose the optimization problem into data collection time minimization subproblem and UAV trajectory design subproblem, which are solved by the successive convex approximation method, and the backtracking algorithm and the genetic algorithm, respectively. Numerical results show that the backtracking-based algorithm that can obtain the optimal trajectory of the UAV gains the minimal average AoI, and the genetic-based algorithm achieves sub-optimal average AoI with much lower computational complexity. The results also demonstrate that the average AoI of the backtracking-based algorithm and the genetic-based algorithm is reduced by up to 54% and 46% compared with the greedy-based benchmark algorithm, respectively.

Both discrete-time and continuous-time linear agent dynamics are considered. A quadratic Lyapunov function is constructed using two positive definite matrices. Two graph matrix inequalities are proposed using the graph Laplacian matrix to calculate the graph positive definite matrix for constructing the Lyapunov function. The continuous-time Riccati inequality and a modified discrete-time Riccati inequality are utilized to calculate the dynamics positive definite matrix for the Lyapunov function design as well as the distributed control design. Average dwell time (ADT) is used to describe the switching signal. Lyapunov analysis is performed to achieve exponential leaderless consensus with convergence rate specified by the parameters in the matrix inequalities and ADT.

The randomly occurring controller gain fluctuation phenomenon is investigated for non-fragile strategy. Moreover, the mixed time-varying delays composed of discrete and distributed delays are considered.

J	Tu, YK				Tu, Yu-Kang			Linear mixed model approach to network meta-analysis for continuous outcomes in periodontal research	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY												AimAnalysing continuous outcomes for network meta-analysis by means of linear mixed models is a great challenge, as it requires statistical software packages to specify special patterns of model error variance and covariance structure. This article demonstrates a non-Bayesian approach to network meta-analysis for continuous outcomes in periodontal research with a special focus on the adjustment of data dependency. DataSeventeen studies on guided tissue regeneration were used to illustrate how the proposed linear mixed models for network meta-analysis of continuous outcomes. Methods & ResultsArm-based network meta-analysis use treatment arms from each study as the unit of analysis; when patients are randomly assigned to each arm, data are deemed independent and therefore no adjustment is required for multi-arm trials. Trial-based network meta-analysis use treatment contrasts as the unit of analysis, and therefore treatment contrasts within a multi-arm trial are not independent. This data dependency occurs also in split-mouth studies, and adjustments for data dependency are therefore required. ConclusionsArm-based analysis is the preferred approach to network meta-analysis, when all included studies use the parallel group design and some compare more than two treatment arms. When included studies used designs that yield dependent data, the trial-based analysis is the preferred approach.

The method simultaneously determines the fixed and tunable/switchable circuit element values in an arbitrary-order canonical filter for a general set of performance constraints over a discrete or continuous set of operating frequencies and source/load impedances. To solve the filter design problem, we combine deterministic nonlinear constrained optimization using Sequential Quadratic Programming with a systematic constraint relaxation approach to facilitate convergence. Using the proposed methodology, we successfully generate three different reconfigurable impedance matching networks with performance requirements that would be difficult to realize using manual design techniques.																			0738-100X		978-1-60558-115-6				2008							498	+																WOS:000258930200099

The dynamics of each system are continuous, whereas the exchange of information on a communication network is operated in a discrete-time manner. The analysis and cooperative control design are transformed into representative forms of discretized systems using a zero-order holder and an ideal sampler. Based on the concept of PS, a design of a distributed static output feedback control for achieving output consensus is proposed. Compared with the concept of passivity, it is shown that PS extends the systems under consideration to higher relative degree and/or non-minimum phase. This extension allows the design of a distributed controller by quantifying the impact of each system in networked operation. Furthermore, properties of PS are discussed both in the continuous and discrete-time domain, and conditions for preserving PS through discretization are presented.

Specifically, we studied the capacity region of a practical uplink NOMA for multiple IoT devices with discrete and continuous inputs, respectively. For discrete inputs, we proposed an entropy approximation method to approach the channel capacity and obtain the discrete inner and outer bounds. For the continuous inputs, we derived the inner and outer bounds in closed forms. Based on these results, we further investigated the optimal receiver beamforming design for the multiple access channel (MAC) of VLC IoT networks to maximize the minimum uplink rate under receiver power constraints. By exploiting the structure of the achievable rate expressions, we showed that the optimal beamformers are the generalized eigenvectors corresponding to the largest generalized eigenvalues. Numerical results show the tightness of the proposed capacity regions and the superiority of the proposed beamformers for VLC IoT networks.

The activation functions are assumed to be neither monotonic, nor differentiable, nor bounded. We aim at designing a state estimator to estimate the neuron states, through available output measurements, such that the dynamics of the estimation error is globally exponentially stable in the presence of mixed time delays. By using the Laypunov-Krasovskii functional, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to establish sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of the state estimators. We show that both the existence conditions and the explicit expression of the desired estimator can be characterized in terms of the solution to an LMI. A simulation example is exploited to show the usefulness of the derived LMI-based stability conditions. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The issue of global exponential stability for impulsive delayed neural networks on time scales is analyzed by employing the convex combination method in this article. Several algebraic and linear matrix inequality conditions are proved by constructing impulse-dependent Lyapunov functionals and using timescale inequality techniques. Unlike the published works, impulsive control strategies can be designed by utilizing our theoretical results to stabilize delayed neural networks on time scales if they are unstable before introducing impulses. Sufficient criteria for global exponential stability in this article are derived based on the timescale theory, and they are applicable to discrete-time impulsive neural networks, their continuous-time analogues, and neural networks whose states are discrete at one time and continuous at another time. Four numerical examples are offered to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our new theoretical results in the end.

The network is implemented based on the Continuous Valued Number System (CVNS) arithmetic with neurons distributed in the network. Synapse weights are implemented on the chip using capacitive analog memories. Weight values are stored as the CVNS values and are refreshed and updated using the overlap between the CVNS digits. Current-mode logic is used for implementation in order to simplify the circuit design, and especially addition, which resulted in reduced power and area consumption. The distributed nature of the neurons allows for expansion of the network into larger networks. Individual modular layers are fabricated in TSMC CMOS 180nm, and are used to form different network sizes.

The problem mentioned above can be divided into two sub-problems: how the control performance depends on the quality of service (QoS) of network such as sampling period, network induced delay and pocket dropout, and how a resource allocation strategy can be designed to optimize the overall control performance. Linear quadratic cost functions are used as control performance indicators. The continuous-time quadratic performance cost indicator is discretized which takes the network QoS into account. To guarantee the network QoS demands, a co-design method of control and bandwidth scheduling is proposed to guarantee both networked control performance and network QoS. Finally, a series of experiments based on Truetime is present, and the results show that the scheme is effective and necessary.																					978-1-4799-3009-8				2014							15	20		10.1109/CSCI.2014.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CSCI.2014.11													WOS:000355911900003

For a case study, this article used the sewer network design of a central Taiwan township, which contains significantly varied elevations, and the optimal designs from TS and SA were compared with the original official design. The results show that, in contrast with the original design's failure to satisfy the minimum flow-velocity requirements, both TS and SA achieved least-cost solutions that also fulfilled all the constraints of the design criteria. According to the average performance of 200 trials, SA outperformed TS in both robustness and efficiency for solving sewer network optimization problems.

This means that the arc sizes need to be feasible for an infinite set of scenarios. The problem can be seen as a strictly robust counterpart of a single-scenario network design problem, which is shown to be NP-complete even on trees. In order to obtain a tractable problem, we introduce a method for generating a finite scenario set such that optimality of a sizing for this finite set implies the sizing's optimality for the originally given infinite set of scenarios. We further prove that the size of the finite scenario set is quadratically bounded above in the number of nodes of the underlying tree and that it can be computed in polynomial time. The resulting problem can then be solved as a standard mixed-integer linear optimization problem. Finally, we show the applicability of our theoretical results by computing globally optimal arc sizes for a realistic hydrogen transport network of Eastern Germany.

By using a novel technique, the design problem of digital PID-type controller is converted into a design problem of static output feedback controller based on the discrete-time system model. The controller gains are obtained using networked control system theory, linear matrix inequality technique and cone complementarity linearization algorithm. By taking the developed systematic procedures, digital PID-type controllers for LFC scheme of a three-area interconnected power system are designed. Simulation results show that the designed controllers provide better robustness against certain time delays than the existing controllers.

Especially, backbone networks will become the main contributor of the overall Internet cost and power consumption. Except the feature of huge total amount, the traffic in future backbone networks will also show high heterogeneity in bandwidth requirement. Based on the variety of those traffic demands, the mixed-line-rate (MLR) schemes have been proposed in recent years. The MLR schemes are considered to be able to support flexibility for network provisioning. To utilize resources in MLR backbone networks efficiently, logical topology design is an important issue. However, previous studies about logical topology design have focused on optimizing either monetary cost or power consumption of the whole network. In this paper, we design logical topology for optical MLR backbone networks by considering both energy efficiency and cost efficiency. The network cost is defined as an integrity consisting of the monetary cost and the power consumption of the whole network. Then, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation is presented to minimize the network cost. In order to evaluate the proposed formulation, it is applied on illustrative case studies. Finally, the numerical results are analyzed and discussed.																			2163-0771		978-1-4673-4728-0				2012							492	497																WOS:000395448600098

The model is formulated as a bi-level multi-objective discrete network design problem which forms a non-convex mixed integer non-linear problem. Solved by a Branch and Bound method, the solution algorithm employs an outer approximation method to estimate the lower bound of each node in the Branch and Bound search tree. The solution algorithm exploits a unique approach for lower-bound computation dealing with a disrupted multi-class network that may not be able to satisfy the demand between all OD pairs due to damaged links. The model is assessed by applying it on the Sioux Falls network. It is also illustrated how the Pareto-optimal solutions achieved by the multi-objective optimisation can vary depending on the emphasis placed on different classes of vehicles.					sarvi, majid/A-2397-2009; Thompson, Russell G/D-6451-2012; Rajabifard, Abbas/D-1818-2015	Thompson, Russell/0000-0002-8128-6586; Rajabifard, Abbas/0000-0002-4256-3173													0049-4488	1572-9435				FEB	2020	47	1					109	143		10.1007/s11116-017-9852-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-017-9852-5													WOS:000512776200005

The difficulties involved in designing large shared-memory computers and the resulting high cost of even modest size systems has led to the proliferation of computer systems consisting of small shared-memory computers connected via low-latency message-passing interconnection networks. This paper describes how a network simulation system using a simulation kernel optimized for high performance operation on shared-memory parallel computers has been extended to operate on computers that mix shared-memory and message-passing paradigms. Results are presented showing that the system can achieve over 60 million simulated packet transmissions per second on 32 4-processor nodes. The results demonstrate the advantage of using a mixture of shared-memory and message-passing over using only message-passing in many cases.																					0-7695-2111-8				2004							17	25		10.1109/PADS.2004.1301281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PADS.2004.1301281													WOS:000222057000003

To solve this important problem, a novel discrete error redefinition neural network (D-ERNN) is proposed. By redefining the error monitoring function and discretization, the proposed neural network is superior to some traditional neural networks in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and overshoot. Compared with the continuous ERNN, the proposed discrete neural network is more suitable for computer implementation. Unlike continuous neural networks, this article also analyzes and proves how to select the parameters and step size of the proposed neural networks to ensure the reliability of the network. Moreover, how to achieve the discretization of the ERNN is presented and discussed. The convergence of the proposed neural network without disturbance is proven, and bounded time-varying disturbances can be resisted in theory. Furthermore, the comparison results with other related neural networks show that the proposed D-ERNN has a faster convergence speed, better antidisturbance ability, and lower overshoot.

In real-time pricing systems, information of the price and power consumption is sent to an ISO (independent system operator) and consumers (i.e., smart meters) through communication networks. Hence, this system can be regarded as a class of networked control systems. In this paper, design of real-time pricing systems over communication networks is discussed. First, a probabilistic discrete model expressing the relation between the price and power consumption is explained. In addition, effects of communication networks are also explained, and directed graphs with communication properties are introduced. Next, the pricing problem is reduced to a mixed integer linear programming problem. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented.

The observed system is jointly observable, i.e., each agent can only access a part of the measurement output of the observed system and cannot recover the full state by itself. The full state estimation has to be achieved by network communication of neighboring agents. In contrast to existing works, the salient feature of this work is that the developed approach can deal with jointly connected switching networks and thus is more resilient to unreliable communication. First, we propose a new observability decomposition method for linear systems in modal canonical form. Then, we design distributed observers for both the continuous-time system and the discrete-time system. Based on the common Lyapunov function approach, we show that the switched estimation error system is asymptotically stable and thus, the full state estimation can be achieved under jointly connected switching networks.

J	Sawada, K; Shin, S				Sawada, Kenji; Shin, Seiichi			Numerical Optimization Design of Dynamic Quantizer via Matrix Uncertainty Approach	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												In networked control systems, continuous-valued signals are compressed to discrete-valued signals via quantizers and then transmitted/received through communication channels. Such quantization often degrades the control performance; a quantizer must be designed that minimizes the output difference between before and after the quantizer is inserted. In terms of the broadbandization and the robustness of the networked control systems, we consider the continuous-time quantizer design problem. In particular, this paper describes a numerical optimization method for a continuous-time dynamic quantizer considering the switching speed. Using a matrix uncertainty approach of sampled-data control, we clarify that both the temporal and spatial resolution constraints can be considered in analysis and synthesis, simultaneously. Finally, for the slow switching, we compare the proposed and the existing methods through numerical examples. From the examples, a new insight is presented for the two-step design of the existing continuous-time optimal quantizer.

J	Wang, SA; Meng, Q; Yang, H				Wang, Shuaian; Meng, Qiang; Yang, Hai			Global optimization methods for the discrete network design problem	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												This paper addresses the discrete network design problem (DNDP) with multiple capacity levels, or multi-capacity DNDP for short, which determines the optimal number of lanes to add to each candidate link in a road network. We formulate the problem as a bi-level programming model, where the upper level aims to minimize the total travel time via adding new lanes to candidate links and the lower level is a traditional Wardrop user equilibrium (UE) problem. We propose two global optimization methods by taking advantage of the relationship between UE and system optimal (SO) traffic assignment principles. The first method, termed as SO-relaxation, exploits the property that an optimal network design solution under SO principle can be a good approximate solution under UE principle, and successively sorts the solutions in the order of increasing total travel time under SO principle. Optimality is guaranteed when the lower bound of the total travel time of the unexplored solutions under UE principle is not less than the total travel time of a known solution under UE principle. The second method, termed as UE-reduction, adds the objective function of the Beckmann-McGuire-Winsten transformation of UE traffic assignment to the constraints of the SO-relaxation formulation of the multi-capacity DNDP. This constraint is convex and strengthens the SO-relaxation formulation. We also develop a dynamic outer-approximation scheme to make use of the state-of-the-art mixed-integer linear programming solvers to solve the SO-relaxation formulation. Numerical experiments based on a two-link network and the Sioux-Falls network are conducted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We assume that all agents can obtain the information of their current and final relative positions with their neighbors, and the final absolute velocities (as well as their current and final relative velocities, the final absolute accelerations for the second-order MASs) through a communication network, whereas two boundary agents are able to obtain their current and final absolute positions (as well as their current and final absolute velocities for the second-order MASs). The neighbor relationship of all agents is described by a spatial variable and two static-feedback controllers are introduced, which can be expressed as a second-order space difference of the spatial variable. Then, the deployment of MASs can be transformed into the stabilization of discrete-space partial differential equation (PDE) systems. Three virtual agents are introduced to constitute the Dirchlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Several algebraic inequality criteria are derived to guarantee that the prescribed-time time-varying deployment can be achieved within a prescribed time under the Dirchlet and mixed boundary conditions. Unlike the published results, our results are derived based on the discrete-space PDE systems instead of continuous-space PDE systems, which is consistent with the discrete spatial distribution of agents. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.

The performance of the model is assessed on a hydrogen network design problem, including renewable elec-tricity, electrolyzer design and hydrogen storage. The share of renewable electricity use increases from 60% to 90% with hydrogen storage. Different compressed gas storage linearized models are compared with different pressure scales and the linearization error is assessed. The introduction of discrete inter -mediate pressures reduces the committed error on compressor power and operating costs, due to the linearization. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, GQ; Görges, D				Li, Guoqiang; Goerges, Daniel			Energy management strategy for parallel hybrid electric vehicles based on approximate dynamic programming and velocity forecast	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												In parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the power split between the engine and the electric motor as well as the gear shift in the gearbox determines the overall energy efficiency. In this paper an adaptive energy management strategy with velocity forecast is proposed to optimize the fuel consumption in parallel HEVs, which is formulated into a mixed-integer optimization problem. Approximate dynamic programming with a novel actor-gear-critic design is presented for simultaneously controlling the power split and gear shift online. The power split as a continuous variable is determined from an actor network to realize the energy distribution between two power sources. The gear shift as a discrete variable is obtained from a gear network to adjust the gear ratio in the gearbox. The concept enables an online learning of the energy management strategy for different driving behaviors without the requirement of a system model and the driving cycle. Simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy achieves close fuel economy compared with the optimal solutions resulting from dynamic programming Furthermore, a multi-stage neural network is introduced for velocity forecast, providing a computationally efficient training framework with good prediction performance. The velocity prediction is finally combined with the energy management strategy for an effective application and fuel economy. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In order to increase fab productivity and mitigate waiting time, AMHS design often intends to reduce transportation time and to avoid congestion. During the time consuming and elaborate layout design process, simulation studies are frequently used for evaluating manually generated layouts. However, in this article an analytical approach is implemented, enabling semi-automated AMHS layout generation with no simulation needed. The applied DNDP is a bi-level mixed-integer optimization model, mostly used in road network design for determining optimal lane additions under consideration of dynamic routing and traffic equilibrium. In this article, the suitability of the DNDP for generating AMHS layouts is assessed. In addition, opportunities and limits of its application are discussed by means of an use case from semiconductor industry. Furthermore, additions to the formulation of the DNDP model are introduced to attain new functionality and ensure suitability to AMHS layout design. Due to its bi-level and non-convex structure, solving the DNDP in acceptable time is considered to be challenging. Thus, the application of two branch & bound algorithms and three heuristics (local search, tabu search and simulated annealing) for solving the DNDP in AMHS design is examined.																			1078-8743		978-1-5386-3748-7				2018							295	300																WOS:000448893500066

First, MRNNs with inertial items are of second-order state derivatives, thereby differing from the classical first-order MRNNs and bringing difficulties to study the dynamics of such systems. By using the order-reduction method, such kind of second-order MRNNs is transferred into conventional first-order differential systems. Then, under two kinds of designed feedback controllers, several sufficient conditions are derived ensuring the FTS of MRNNs with inertial items and mixed delays. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the results and one application is also presented in pseudorandom number generation.						lu, zhenyu/0000-0002-5066-4716													2168-2216	2168-2232				MAY	2021	51	5					2701	2711		10.1109/TSMC.2019.2916073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2019.2916073													WOS:000640749000006

The parameters of the neural networks under consideration switch over time subject to a Markov chain. The networks involve both the discrete-time-varying delay and the mode-dependent distributed time-delay characterized by the upper and lower boundaries dependent on the Markov chain. By constructing novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, sufficient conditions are firstly established to guarantee the exponential stability in mean square for the addressed discrete-time neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters and mixed time-delays. Then, the state estimation problem is coped with for the same neural network where the goal is to design a desired state estimator such that the estimation error approaches zero exponentially in mean square. The derived conditions for both the stability and the existence of desired estimators are expressed in the form of matrix inequalities that can be solved by the semi-definite programme method. A numerical simulation example is exploited to demonstrate the usefulness of the main results obtained.

Stochastic Stability for a Class of Discrete-time Switched Neural Networks with Stochastic Noise and Time-varying Mixed Delays	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND SYSTEMS												In this paper, stochastic stability is analyzed for a class of discrete-time switched neural networks, in which time-varying mixed delays and stochastic noise are considered. Specifically, benefitting from the triple summation term included in a new Lyapunov functional, time-varying distributed delays are tackled and a criterion of decay estimation for a non-switched neural network is firstly obtained. Subsequently, in view of average dwell time methodology and stochastic analysis, several sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that the stochastic stability problem is solvable. Furthermore, the derived sufficient conditions reflect that the decay rate of the considered neural networks has a close relationship with average dwell time, upper and lower bounds of delays and intensity of stochastic noise.

To address this issue, this article proposes a dynamic collaborative charging algorithm that acts on both the mobile nodes and the static nodes in a sensing node network. The proposed scheme is to design a collaborative group of charging robots that can rendezvous with the sensing nodes. The group includes aerial charging vehicles (ACVs)-able to charge the underpowered mobile nodes, and terrestrial charging vehicles (TCVs), which charge their targeted static nodes. The aim of this study is to optimize the charging effect and the energy cost in the rendezvous process. This approach consists of two subalgorithms: 1) a charging algorithm for mobile nodes (CAMNs) and 2) a charging algorithm for static nodes (CASNs). The CAMNs is designed so that each underpowered mobile node can be charged by a dedicated ACV. For this purpose, a deep learning model is trained to divide the underpowered mobile nodes into appropriate clusters, each of which is equipped with a mobile base station. The rendezvous process is then constructed as a mixed continuous/discrete optimization problem, which is solved by using the firefly algorithm. In addition, the CASNs ensures that the TCVs traverse their routes, charging static nodes as they proceed. This traversing process was formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem, solved by using genetic algorithm. Through various experiments and case studies, the results have demonstrated both the feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

J	Wang, ZM; Furukawa, S				Wang, Zaoming; Furukawa, Shuhei			Pore-Networked Soft Materials Based on Metal-Organic Polyhedra	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH												The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous development of crystalline microporous adsorbents in a wide range of applications including molecular adsorption, storage and separation, purification, as well as catalysis. The main players as porous materials that have contributed to the developments are extended molecular frameworks (e.g., metal-organic frameworks, MOFs; covalent-organic frameworks, COFs) or discrete porous molecules (e.g., metal-organic cages, MOCs; porous organic cages, POCs) thanks to the high degrees of freedom in their structural designability and tunability. To overcome the processability issue originating from their powder forms after synthesis, one main strategy is to hybridize the microporous adsorbents as pore-containing fillers with solvents or polymers as processable matrices to produce porous soft materials, such as porous liquids, gels/aerogels, and mixed-matrix membranes, depending on the form of matrix used. Nevertheless, the fabrication of "ideal" hybrid materials relies on the homogeneous distribution of the pore-containing fillers within the matrices. It is still challenging to find a versatile way to solve the aggregation issues of fillers and their insufficient interaction with the matrices, which are concerned with inhibiting the translation of the distinctive properties of microporous adsorbents into the obtained hybrid soft materials. Herein, we describe a new bottom-up approach for the fabrication of "pore-networked soft materials" based on the concept of directly interconnecting the pore-containing fillers into a continuous pore network within the matrices. The advantages of the pore-networking strategy lie in two main aspects: (i) the elimination of the need to struggle with the aggregation issue of fillers due to their overall interconnection throughout the matrices; (ii) the generation of continuous pore networks that guarantee the efficient molecular mass transfer in the materials. In this Account, we summarize our state-of-the-art progress of pore-networked soft materials based on the use of MOCs, alternatively called metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) herein, as pore units for the pore network construction. The good solubility of MOPs in organic solvents allows them to be feasibly processed in solution, wherein the coordination of MOPs with organic linkers leads to the formation of linked MOP gels featuring not only intrinsic MOP cavities but also tunable extrinsic porosities generated between linked MOPs through the control of MOP/linker structures and network connectivity. Furthermore, the matrix of the linked MOP network, here referred to as the continuous phase with respect to the entire porous MOP network, is not limited to the solvents. We anticipate that the implementation of air, liquids, and polymers as the matrices could result in different forms of pore-networked soft materials like aerogels, foams, gels, monoliths, and membranes. For instance, we demonstrate the fabrication of linked MOP aerogel and permanently porous gel with their potential applications on selective CO2 photoreduction and gas sorption, respectively. We believe that the pore-network strategies will advance the development of porous soft materials featuring unique advantages and properties beyond the current hybrid systems.

The continuous-time linear system under consideration is first transformed into a discrete-time system, where the system matrix of the discrete-time system is characterized by stochastic characteristic. Then, by the matrix exponential computation, an equivalent discrete-time stochastic system is established. Based on this, a controller is designed by the law of total expectation, which guarantees the stochastic stability of the closed-loop stochastic system. Finally, a numerical example and an example using power grid with IEEE 4-bus line are used to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design algorithm.

JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS												Selecting an appropriate mathematical model to describe the dynamical behavior of a genetic regulatory network plays an important part in discovering gene regulatory mechanisms. Whereas fine-scale models can in principle provide a very accurate description of the real genetic regulatory system, one must be aware of the availability and quality of the data used to infer such models. Consequently, pragmatic considerations motivate the selection of a model possessing minimal complexity among those capable of capturing the level of real gene regulation being studied, particularly in relation to the prediction capability of the model.

Optimization is one of its major subjects, where a problem can be mathematically formulated and its optimal solution is determined by using derivatives. However, this calculus-based derivative technique can only be applied to real-valued or continuous-valued functions rather than discrete-valued functions while there are many situations where design variables contain not continuous values but discrete values by nature. In order to consider these realistic design situations, this study proposes a novel derivative for discrete design variables based on a harmony search algorithm. Detailed analysis shows how this new stochastic derivative works in the bench-mark function and fluid-transport network design. Hopefully this new derivative, as a fundamental technology, will be utilized in various science and engineering problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A fixed-charge capacitated network design model is formulated, and two efficient heuristics are proposed to determine near-optimal solutions to the resulting NP-hard problem. The first heuristic iteratively adjusts the are fixed costs and selectively includes arcs in the flow network until a feasible network is obtained. The second heuristic partially explores the problem state-space. Both heuristics are tested against an implicit enumeration scheme used to obtain optimal solutions for small examples. For more realistic cases, solutions are compared to lower bounds obtained by linear programming relaxation of the mixed integer program or by an iterative dual-ascent algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning-assisted optimization framework to design multi-layered core-shell particles that provide a scattering response on demand. Artificial neural networks can learn to predict the scattering spectrum of core-shell particles with high accuracy and can act as fully differentiable surrogate models for a gradient-based design approach. To enable the fabrication of the particles, we consider existing materials and introduce a novel two-step optimization to treat continuous geometric parameters and discrete feasible materials simultaneously. Moreover, we overcome the non-uniqueness of the problem and expand the design space to particles of varying numbers of shells, i.e., different number of optimization parameters, with a classification network. Our method is 1-2 orders of magnitudes faster than conventional approaches in both forward prediction and inverse design and is potentially scalable to even larger and more complex scatterers.

Users of a secondary network may attempt to acquire the best bands based on prior information. Without any cooperation among users during or after sensing, multiple users may attempt to sense/acquire the same band leading to a loss in throughput due to contentions. We propose a continuous channel selection strategy and show that it maximally utilizes the opportunity in the physical layer which was left untapped by the existing works. The throughput performance of the proposed continuous channel selections in both low and high opportunity primary activity profiles outperforms the discrete selection based design. We also propose a low complexity algorithm to achieve optimal channel selection among users. Numerical results show that system throughput with continuous channel selections is better than with discrete channel selections. In the worst case interference scenario, continuous selections perform as good as discrete selections.

However, intensive memory access of activations introduces considerable energy consumption, resulting in a great challenge for deploying CNNs on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing research utilizes dimension reduction (DR) and mixed-precision (MP) quantization separately to reduce computational complexity without paying attention to their interaction. Such naive concatenation of different compression strategies ends up with suboptimal performance. To develop a comprehensive compression framework, we propose an optimization system by jointly considering DR and MP quantization, which is enabled by independent groupwise learnable MP schemes. Group partitioning is guided by a well-designed automatic group partition mechanism that can distinguish compression priorities among channels, and it can deal with the tradeoff between model accuracy and compressibility. Moreover, to preserve model accuracy under low bit-width quantization, we propose a dynamic bit-width searching technique to enable continuous bit-width reduction. Our experimental results show that the proposed system reaches 69.03%/70.73% with average 2.16/2.61 bits per value on Resnet18/MobileNetV2, while introducing only approximately 1% accuracy loss of the uncompressed full-precision models. Compared with individual activation compression schemes, the proposed joint optimization system reduces 55%/9% (-2.62/-0.27 bits) memory access of DR and 55%/63% (-2.60/-4.52 bits) memory access of MP quantization, respectively, on Resnet18/ MobileNetV2 with comparable or even higher accuracy.

A matching mechanism is proposed to synchronise the sampled data between the plant and an observer, and computes the corresponding error. Using the error, the multirate observer is developed to estimate the state of the system in real time. A state feedback controller based on the observer is utilised to control the system. Different from discrete-time modelling methods, the resulting closed-loop system is modelled as a continuous-time system with multiple sawtooth input-delays. Inspired by Wirtinger's inequality, a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed to analyse efficiently the closed-loop system in the presence of time-varying network-induced delays. Then sufficient conditions for H-infinity performance analysis and the observer-based controller design are presented. Finally, two illustrative examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Kleinert, T; Schmidt, M				Kleinert, Thomas; Schmidt, Martin			Global optimization of multilevel electricity market models including network design and graph partitioning	DISCRETE OPTIMIZATION												We consider the combination of a network design and graph partitioning model in a multilevel framework for determining the optimal network expansion and the optimal zonal configuration of zonal pricing electricity markets, which is an extension of the model discussed in Grimm et al. (2019) that does not include a network design problem. The two classical discrete optimization problems of network design and graph partitioning together with nonlinearities due to economic modeling yield extremely challenging mixed-integer nonlinear multilevel models for which we develop two problem-tailored solution techniques. The first approach relies on an equivalent bilevel formulation and a standard KKT transformation thereof including novel primal-dual bound tightening techniques, whereas the second is a tailored generalized Benders decomposition. For the latter, we strengthen the Benders cuts of Grimm et al. (2019) by using the structure of the newly introduced network design subproblem. We prove for both methods that they yield global optimal solutions. Afterward, we compare the approaches in a numerical study and show that the tailored Benders approach clearly outperforms the standard KKT transformation. Finally, we present a case study that illustrates the economic effects that are captured in our model. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, in certain real-world kinematic control tasks that involve robot control based on kinematic properties, the action space is parameterized, wherein actions are represented by a fusion of discrete actions and continuous parameters. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical RL architecture designed specifically for handling parameterized action spaces. Our architecture consists of two levels, the higher level (discrete actor network) selects the discrete action and the lower level (continuous actor networks) determines the corresponding continuous parameters. These components work in tandem to generate an action-parameters vector to interact with the environment. Both the higher and lower levels share the rewards of environmental feedback and the critic networks to update the network weights. The soft actor critic and deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms are adopted to update higher-level and lower-level policies, respectively. Through simulation experiments conducted on different kinematic control tasks with parameterized action spaces, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

The network topology under consideration is assumed to be governed by a Markov chain with time-varying transition probabilities (TPs). The variation of TPs is subject to a kind of slow switching signals; that is, the average dwell time (ADT) switching. The focus is on the design of non-fragile mixed mode-dependent/-independent controllers such that the underlying network reaches stochastic mean-square synchronisation with a mixed H/l(2)-l performance level for an admissible switching signal with ADT. By using a new mixed H/l(2)-l performance index, combined with the switched control method, the solutions to the considered problem are formulated.

J	Liu, YC; Wang, HD				Liu, Yongcun; Wang, Handing			Surrogate-assisted hybrid evolutionary algorithm with local estimation of distribution for expensive mixed-variable optimization problems	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												Some real-world design optimization problems can be formulated as expensive mixed-variable op-timization problems (EMVOPs), which involve both continuous and discrete decision variables and expensive function evaluations. The main challenges for solving EMVOPs are the handling of mixed variables, limited number of function evaluations and multiple disconnected regions in the search space. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm with global and local search strategies for improving the search ability on disconnected regions, and it only consumes hundreds of function evaluations. The global module employs hybrid evolutionary operators and a Gower distance based surrogate model for handling mixed variables. The local estimation of distributions in different local regions performs in a competitive switching way to combine their advantages, and local surrogate models trained with selected samples improve the accuracy of approximated evaluations for the locally generated solutions. In the late stage, a local continuous search module is executed for refining the continuous decision variables. Verification results on the artificial benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is competitive and works effectively. To verify the practicability of the algorithm, it is applied on a convolutional neural network hyperparameter optimization problems and obtains satisfactory results. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, the delay tolerant network does not meet this condition. Therefore, we construct a novel blockchain transaction framework with discrete token negotiation called DTNB, which can be deployed on the delay tolerant network to provide transaction services. Specifically, we present the structure of add-chains by modifying the existing block structure. Then, we design a mining qualification determining scheme to achieve fair transactions, including discrete token generation algorithm and mining qualification attribution algorithm, and this scheme avoids the problem that nodes with more stakes in the PoS and DPoS algorithms can obtain mining qualifications with a higher probability. Furthermore, we present two mining schemes and also design a fork processing algorithm, which ensures that blocks on the add-chain generated by the local network can be appended to the main chain with the equal probability. Finally, we design the second consensus algorithm to avoid the problem of false and repeated transactions of the blocks on the add-chains in the local network. Theoretical analysis shows three properties of DTNB, including safety, reliability and activeness, and the experimental simulations demonstrate DTNB has advantages in throughput, block generation time and fork rate.

They must rely on carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies to reduce their production processes' inevitable carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. For transporting continuously large amounts of CO2, utilizing a pipeline network is the most effective solution; however, building such a network is expensive. Therefore minimizing the cost of the pipelines to be built is extremely important to make the operation financially feasible. In this context, we investigate the problem of finding optimal pipeline diameters from a discrete set of diameters for a tree-shaped network transporting captured CO2 from multiple sources to a single sink. The general problem of optimizing arc capacities in potential-based fluid networks is already a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem. The problem becomes even more complex when adding the highly sensitive nonlinear behavior of CO2 regarding temperature and pressure changes. We propose an iterative algorithm splitting the problem into two parts: (a) the pipe-sizing problem under a fixed supply scenario and temperature distribution and (b) the thermophysical modeling, including mixing effects, the Joule-Thomson effect, and heat exchange with the surrounding environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying our algorithm to a real-world network planning problem for a CO2 network in Western Germany. Further, we show the robustness of the algorithm by solving a large artificially created set of network instances.

The advantage of a continuous-state system model is that it represents realities more accurately than discrete-state system models. However, using conventional optimization algorithms to solve the optimal design problem for continuous-state systems becomes very complex. Under general cases, it is impossible to obtain an explicit expression of the objective function to be optimized. In this paper, we propose a neural network (NN) approach to approximate the objective function. Once the approximate optimization model is obtained with the NN approach, the subsequent optimization methods and procedures are the same and straightforward. A 2-stage example is given to compare the analytical approach with the proposed NN approach. A complicated 4-stage example is given to illustrate that it is easy to use the NN approach while it is too difficult to solve the problem analytically.

Linear quadratic networked control of uncertain polytopic systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												This paper investigates the problem of designing robust linear quadratic regulators for uncertain polytopic continuous-time systems over networks subject to delays. The main contribution is to provide a procedure to determine a discrete-time representation of the weighting matrices associated to the quadratic criterion and an accurate discretized model, in such a way that a robust state feedback gain computed in the discrete-time domain assures a guaranteed quadratic cost to the closed-loop continuous-time system. The obtained discretized model has matrices with polynomial dependence on the uncertain parameters and an additive norm-bounded term representing the approximation residual error. A strategy based on linear matrix inequality relaxations is proposed to synthesize, in the discrete-time domain, a digital robust state feedback control law that stabilizes the original continuous-time system assuring an upper bound to the quadratic cost of the closed-loop system. The applicability of the proposed design method is illustrated through a numerical experiment. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Inspired by recent deep learning algorithms on binarized neural networks, binary activation with a straight-through gradient estimator is used to model the leaky integrate-fire spiking neuron, overcoming the difficulty in training SNNs using back propagation. Two SNN training algorithms are proposed: (1) SNN with discontinuous integration, which is suitable for rate-coded input spikes, and (2) SNN with continuous integration, which is more general and can handle input spikes with temporal information. Neuromorphic hardware designed in 28nm CMOS exploits the spike sparsity and demonstrates high classification accuracy (>98% on MNIST) and low energy (51.4-773 nJ/image).

For the first time, a novel method based on a discrete-time event-triggered mechanism and a nonlinear fractional-order state observer is obtained. A new discrete-time event-triggered mechanism is first proposed. Then a new nonlinear fractional-order state observer based on the newly discrete-time event-triggered mechanism is designed to estimate state vectors of the fractional-order neural networks robustly. The discrete-time event-triggered mechanism is Zeno-free, and it helps reduce unnecessary continuous signal transmission. A fractional-order-dependent condition to guarantee the existence of the discrete-time event-triggered nonlinear fractional-order state observer is established. This condition is translated into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved easily by MATLAB. The solution to this problem minimizes the attenuation levels and thus reduces the error in estimating the state vector of the fractional-order neural networks. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by two numerical examples and simulation results.

Firstly, an arctangent adaptive event-triggering scheme (AAETS) is designed to reduce the frequency of communication. This AAETS can be adjusted adaptively based on each sampling instant due to the fact that the triggering thresholds depending on continuous function are updated. Secondly, a networked time-varying delay system model is delicately designed by taking into account the network-induced delay, RONs, ROUs, and the AAETS. According to Lyapunov function method, sufficient admissible criteria to verdict admissibility and stabilization criteria to co-design the triggering matrix and the controller gain are obtained, respectively. Admissible criteria and stability criteria produce a tradeoff between the required communication resources and the desired control performance. Finally, a comparative example is provided to show the effectiveness and the advantageous performances of the designed AAETS. (c) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Even when the input set is specifically designed/architected to segue to a convex paradigm, the resultant output set may still turn out to be nonconvex, thereby necessitating a transformation to a convex optimization problem via certain relaxation techniques. This transformation in itself may spawn yet other nonconvex optimization problems, highlighting the need/opportunity to utilize a Robust Convex Relaxation (RCR) framework. In this paper, we explore a particular class of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), namely Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGANs), to solve not only the QoS-related convex optimization problems but also to leverage the same RCR mechanism for tuning its own hyperparameters. This approach gives rise to various technical challenges. For example, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is often used for hyperparameter reduction/tuning. When implemented on a DCGAN, PSO requires converting continuous/discontinuous hyperparameters to discrete values, which may result in premature stagnation of particles at local optima. The involved implementation mechanics, such as increasing the inertial weighting, may spawn yet other convex optimization problems. We introduce a RCR framework that capitalizes upon the feed-forward structure of the "You Only Look Once" (YOLO)-based DCGAN. Specifically, we use a squeezed Deep Convolutional-YOLO-Generative Adversarial Network (DC-YOLO-GAN), hereinafter referred to as a Modified Squeezed YOLO v3 Implementation (MSY3I), combined with convex relaxation adversarial training to improve the bound tightening for each successive neural network layer and to better facilitate the global optimization via a specific numerical stability implementation within MSY3I.

The net input signals are currents instead of voltages as presented in previous approaches, thus avoiding the need for current-to-voltage dedicated interfaces in image processing tasks with photosensor devices. Outputs may be either currents or voltages. Cell design relies on exploitation of current mirror properties for the efficient implementation of both linear and nonlinear analog operators. These cells are simpler and easier to design than those found in previously reported CT and DT-CNN devices. Basic design issues are covered, together with discussions on the influence of nonidealities and advanced circuit design issues as well as design for manufacturability considerations associated with statistical analysis. Three prototypes have been designed for 1.6-mum n-well CMOS technologies. One is discrete-time and can be reconfigured via local logic for noise removal, feature extraction (borders and edges), shadow detection, hole filling, and connected component detection (CCD) on a rectangular grid with unity neighborhood radius. The other two prototypes are continuous-time and fixed template: one for CCD and other for noise removal. Experimental results are given illustrating performance of these prototypes.					; Espejo Meana, Servando/M-1637-2014	Dominguez Castro, Rafael/0000-0002-9924-3410; Espejo Meana, Servando/0000-0003-2609-2663; Rodriguez Vazquez, Angel Benito/0000-0002-1006-5241													1057-7130					MAR	1993	40	3					132	146		10.1109/82.222812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/82.222812													WOS:A1993LM86600002

Based on the isothermal Euler equations, linearized continuous-time gas pipeline network models with boundary actuation and sensing in the infinite-dimensional space are established, with consideration of Rankine-Hugoniot conditions at junction joints. Cayley-Tustin bilinear transformation is applied for model time discretization without any spatial approximation, by which the continuous-time model with unbounded operators is transformed into an infinite-dimensional discrete-time system with all bounded operators and essential continuoustime properties are invariant under this transformation. Based on the internal model principle, the discrete output regulator is constructed and its solvability conditions are provided. Considering the unavailability of the full state information, observer design methods for state estimation of exogenous and pipeline systems are proposed in order to construct an output feedback regulator. Additionally, a stability analysis of the considered pipeline system is provided. Finally, two simulation examples representing a single gas pipeline and a star-shaped pipeline network are given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic design and re-design of multi-echelon, multi-product logistics networks with outsourcing opportunities: A computational study	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING												We address the problem of designing/redesigning a multi-echelon logistics network over multiple periods. Strategic decisions comprise opening new facilities and selecting their capacities from a set of available discrete sizes. Capacity expansion may occur more than once over the time horizon both at new locations and at existing facilities. In addition, logistics decisions involving supplier selection, procurement, production, and distribution of multiple products are to be made. The latter also involve the choice of transportation modes with limited capacities. Finally, a strategic choice between in-house manufacturing and a mixed approach with product outsourcing is to be taken. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming model and develop additional inequalities to enhance the original formulation. To gain insight into the complexity of the problem at hand, an extensive computational study is performed with randomly generated instances that are solved with standard mathematical optimization software. Useful managerial insights are derived from varying several parameters and analyzing the impact of different business strategies on various segments of the logistics network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Network devices can borrow the same concepts as a basis for their energy-efficient design; however, to effectively tailor network processors for their specific applications, the set of energy-aware states defined by the ACPI and their parameters should be carefully chosen. In particular when designing network hardware, one should address the problem of optimizing parameter values (most often chosen in a discrete set) to trade-off energy efficiency and network performance. In this paper, we provide a methodology for such choice, by investigating this trade-off over a continuous spectrum of parameter values.

A novel linear mapping function is presented to transform the complex-valued system into the real-valued system. Under such mapping function, both continuous-time and discrete-time MCVNNs are analyzed in this paper. Firstly, when activation functions are continuous but not Lipschitz continuous, an extended matrix inequality is proved to ensure the stability of continuous-time MCVNNs. Furthermore, if activation functions are discontinuous, a discontinuous adaptive controller is designed to acquire its stability by applying Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Secondly, compared with techniques in continuous-time MCVNNs, the Halanay-type inequality and comparison principle are firstly used to exploit the dynamical behaviors of discrete-time MCVNNs. Finally, the effectiveness of theoretical results is illustrated through numerical examples. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this research, we extended the CLGSA to tackle NP-hard combinatorial problems and introduced the Discrete Comprehensive Learning Gravitational Search Algorithm (D-CLGSA). The D-CLGSA framework incorporated a refined position and velocity update scheme tailored for discrete problems. To evaluate the algorithm's efficiency, we conducted two sets of experiments. Firstly, we assessed its performance on a diverse range of 24 benchmarks encompassing unimodal, multimodal, composite, and special discrete functions. Secondly, we applied the D-CLGSA to a practical optimization problem involving water distribution network planning and management. The D-CLGSA model was coupled with the hydraulic simulation solver EPANET to identify the optimal design for the water distribution network, aiming for cost-effectiveness. We evaluated the model's performance on six distribution networks, namely Two-loop network, Hanoi network, New-York City network, GoYang network, BakRyun network, and Balerma network.

A Software Tool for Automated Management and Supervisory Control of Shipboard Integrated Power Systems	2012 IEEE POWER AND ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING	IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM				General Meeting of the IEEE-Power-and-Energy-Society	JUL 22-26, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE Power & Energy Soc				This paper presents a software tool for automated management, supervision and control of shipboard Integrated Power Systems (IPS). A formalism of switched dynamic systems is used to develop a framework for optimal and supervisory control of the IPS. Switched dynamical systems are translated to mixed binary and real variable formulas which can be used to compute optimal control by dynamic programming or develop supervision strategies to preserve system integrity during disturbances. The tool consists of a simulation platform capable of representing continuous time differential algebraic power system models of varying fidelity, as well as discrete time events such as faults and reconfiguration. The simulation platform is integrated with symbolic computation tools for controller synthesis. Modular design allows for flexibility in incorporating multiple component and network models while faster than real time simulation speed enables efficient computation of controller strategies.																			1944-9925		978-1-4673-2729-9				2012																								WOS:000312493700002
J	Zhao, X; Marquardt, W				Zhao, Xiao; Marquardt, Wolfgang			Reactor network synthesis with guaranteed robust stability	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This paper proposes a systematic approach to design reactor networks with guaranteed robust stability. The approach is based on the superstructure approach for reactor network synthesis. A structured dynamic model for reactor network modeling is formulated and embedded in a MINLP with robust eigenvalue constraints. Design parameters, structural alternatives and parametric uncertainty are considered simultaneously as design degrees of freedom. Structural alternatives result from decisions on the existence of reactors and flow connections in the superstructure. Parametric uncertainty may either result from model uncertainties such as reaction kinetic constants or heat transfer coefficients, or from process uncertainties including slow disturbances in load or quality of raw materials. A tailored two-step solution strategy is proposed to tackle the robust mixed -integer optimization problem. A case study with five continuous stirred -tank reactors (CSTR) and five plug flow reactors (PFR) is presented for illustration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The use of a mixed distribution function to evaluate rain gauge networks has an important advantage of considering rainfall intermittency in both time and space. Parameters of both mixed and continuous distribution functions were estimated using the daily rainfall data collected in the Choongju Dam Basin, Korea. The optimal number of rain gauge stations is, then, decided by using the entropy theory. The optimal number of rain gauge stations estimated by applying the mixed distribution function was found to be much smaller, but still reasonable, than that estimated by applying the continuous distribution function; mostly due to the small wet probability and the high coincidence of daily rainfall between rain gauge stations.

A networked predictive control scheme is employed to compensate for random communication delays, which mainly consists of the control prediction generator and network delay compensator. Furthermore, a new strategy of designing the time-varying predictive controller with mixed random delays for networked systems is proposed. Then the system can be formulated as a Markovian jump system. New techniques are presented to deal with the distributed delay in the discrete-time domain. Based on analysis of closed-loop networked predictive control systems, the designed predictive time-varying output feedback controller can achieve the desired control performance and also guarantee system stability. Simulation examples demonstrate the compensation for random communication delays and data loss in networked systems using the proposed predictive controller design strategy.

As in the continuous-time case, the discrete-time update laws involve auxiliary terms, or Q-modification terms, predicated on an estimate of the unknown neural network weights which in turn involve a set of auxiliary equations characterizing a set of affine hyperplanes. In addition, we show that the Q-modification terms in the discrete-time update law are designed to minimize an error criterion involving a sum of squares of the distances between the update weights and the family of affine hyperplanes.																			0743-1619		978-1-4244-7427-1				2010							2482	2486																WOS:000287187902143

Firstly, the new concept of mixedK-dissipativity is proposed for DIHS. Then, the criteria of stabilization in the sense of ISS are derived for mixed K-dissipative DIHS. It shows that for a mixed K-dissipative DIHS, under the same state feedback control, even if all subsystems have no ISS, the whole DIHS may still has ISS property. The results are then used to study the case of network via impulsive interconnections. The linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for K-dissipativity of every DIHS in the network under the mixed quadratic supply rate are derived. Moreover, the interconnection control is designed to stabilize the network to ISS. Finally, one example is given for illustration.

The closed-loop NCS is modeled as a discrete-time linear system with a time-varying, bounded state delay. Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability and the FTS of the closed-loop NCS are provided, respectively. Based on the stability analysis results, a mixed controller design method, which guarantees the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop NCS in the usual case and the FTS of the closed-loop NCS in the unusual case (that is, in some particular time intervals, large state delay occurs), is presented. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed mixed controller design method.

By virtue of theories of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand sides, inequality techniques, and the comparison method, an algebraic criterion is derived to stabilize the addressed FMNNs with bounded discrete and distributed time delays via a designed fuzzy state feedback controller in Filippov's sense. The result can be reinforced to stabilize FMNNs with unbounded discrete time delays. Meanwhile, exponential stabilization of FMNNs with bounded discrete time delays and unbounded continuously distributed delays is also discussed. FMNNs in this study are general since fuzzy logics and hybrid time delays are all considered, and the obtained conditions enhance and extend some existing ones.

By using the continuous Jensen inequality, linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based H-infinity model reference tracking controller design for nominal NCSs with controller-to-actuator communication constraints is presented, and a new method is proposed to design H-infinity model reference tracking controllers for NCSs with both controller-to-actuator and sensor-to-controller communication constraints. The results are also extended to NCSs with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. The merits of the proposed methods lie in their less computational complexity and less conservatism, which are achieved by adopting continuous Jensen inequality and proposing new controller design methods, respectively.

Multilayer perceptron for simulation models reduction: Application to a sawmill workshop	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE												Simulation is often used to evaluate supply chain or workshop management. This simulation task needs models, which are difficult to construct. The aim of this work is to reduce the complexity of a simulation model design. The proposed approach combines discrete and continuous approaches in order to construct speeder and simpler reduced model. The simulation model focuses on bottlenecks with a discrete approach according to the theory of constraints. The remaining of the workshop must be taken into account in order to describe how the bottlenecks are fed. It is modeled through a continuous approach thanks to a neural network. In particular, we use a multilayer perceptron. The structure of the network is determined by using a pruning procedure. For validation, this approach is applied to the modelisation of a sawmill workshop. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The existing methods require that agents communicate with their neighbors in real time. In this article, we propose two discrete-time communication schemes based on the designed continuous-time strategy-updating rule for the efficient use of communication resources. First, the property of the designed continuous-time rule is analyzed to ensure that all agents' strategies can reach the Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we propose, respectively, periodic and event-triggered communication schemes for the discrete-time interactions among agents. The rule in the periodic case is implemented synchronously. The rule in the event-triggered case is executed asynchronously without Zeno behaviors. All agents in both cases can reach the NE asymptotically by interacting with neighbors at discrete times.

The main complication of this Networked Control System (NCS) control architecture is the presence of variable time delays. One solution is to reduce the temporal dependency of the individual parts of this model by introducing a buffer at the actuator. As long as variable delay is shorter than buffer length, the loop delay is constant and is equal to the buffer length. This makes design of the controller and stability analysis much easier. This paper proposes a novel co-design method taking into account sampling period, network parameters and optimal buffer length. A case study for a liquid level stabilisation problem is given.

The nonlinear neural activation function satisfies the sector-bounded condition and the logarithmic quantization error is transformed to the norm-bounded uncertainty. In order to save the networks resources, the maximum-error-first (MEF) protocol is introduced to allocate the utilization order of the network channel. The focus is on the design of non-fragile state estimator to ensure such that, in the simultaneous presence of the mixed time-delays, quantization errors and estimator gain perturbations, real state is confined to the ellipsoid. In particular, a minimization problem is given to determine the radius of the designed ellipsoid and the estimator gain matrix by testifying the feasibility of some recursive matrix inequalities.

An actor-critic structure is adopted for designing the controller, in which the critic network is tuned by itself and generates the reinforcement learning signal to tune actor network which generates the input signal to the system. The designed controller can achieve asymptotic convergence of the tracking error and performance measurement signal to zero, while ensuring boundedness of parameter estimation errors.

J	Astorino, A; Gaudioso, M; Miglionico, G				Astorino, Annabella; Gaudioso, Manlio; Miglionico, Giovanna			Lagrangian relaxation for the directional sensor coverage problem with continuous orientation	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												We present a mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation of the Directional Sensors Continuous Coverage Problem (DSCCP), where a given set of targets on a plane are to be covered by a set of sensors whose locations are known. Sensors are supposed to be directional, that is characterized by a discrete set of possible radii and aperture angles. The orientation (which is a continuous variable), the radius and the aperture angle of each sensor are to be decided, taking into account possibility of keeping one or more sensors switched off. The objective is to minimize cost coverage. We incorporate into the objective function penalty cost for possibly uncovered targets. We prove NP-hardness of DSCCP and introduce a Lagrangian relaxation model. We design a dual ascent procedure based on acting on a single multiplier at a time accompanied by a heuristics to find a feasible solution at each ascent iteration. We report also the results of the method on several test problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This letter examines the effect of network topology on the linearized time-invariant dynamics of electric power systems. The proposed framework utilizes H-2-norm based stability metrics to study the optimal placement of lines on existing networks as well as the topology design of new networks. The design task is first posed as an NP-hard mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that is exactly reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using McCormick linearization. To improve computation time, graph-theoretic properties are exploited to derive valid inequalities (cuts) and tighten bounds on the continuous optimization variables. Moreover, a cutting plane generation procedure is put forth that is able to interject the MILP solver and augment additional constraints to the problem on-the-fly. The efficacy of our approach in designing optimal grid topologies is demonstrated through numerical tests on the IEEE 39-bus network.

The discrete-time model with mixed time delays is used to express the target system.

By utilizing output measurements from each individual sensor and its neighboring sensors, we design distributed state estimators with a view to approximating the states of the target system in a distributed manner.

At a cost of 1 million Euros per kilometer the extension of the European pipeline network is already a multi-billion Euro business. Therefore, automatic planning tools that support the decision process are desired. We model the topology optimization problem in gas networks by a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). This gives rise to a so-called active transmission problem, a continuous nonlinear non-convex feasibility problem which emerges from the MINLP model by fixing all integral variables. We offer novel sufficient conditions for proving the infeasibility of this active transmission problem. These conditions can be expressed in the form of a mixed-integer program (MILP), i.e., the infeasibility of a non-convex continuous nonlinear program (NLP) can be certified by solving an MILP. This result provides an efficient pruning procedure in a branch-and-bound algorithm. Our computational results demonstrate a substantial speedup for the necessary computations.																			2192-4406	2192-4414				MAR	2017	5	1-2			SI		239	261		10.1007/s13675-016-0077-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13675-016-0077-8													WOS:000406578200009

This letter proposed a PA model based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), where policy-based power selection assisted with value-based evaluation is leveraged to explore the optimal result from a continuous power space. Specifically, this model uses two CNNs named actors to formulate continuous deterministic PA strategy function instead of discrete power distribution sampling, and designs another two CNNs named critics for PA strategy evaluation and actor CNNs' update supervision. Additionally, to reduce the interference, a tunable service base station set is designed for each user and is considered for the model training. Experiments demonstrate the proposed DDPG-based PA model respectively reaches 116.2% and 95.9% sum-rate relative to the iterative algorithm in small and large-scale networks.

A Symbolic Approach to the Design of Nonlinear Networked Control Systems	HSCC 12: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 15TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HYBRID SYSTEMS: COMPUTATION AND CONTROL					15th ACM International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC 2012)	APR 17-19, 2012	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	ACM SIGBED				Networked control systems (NCS) are spatially distributed systems where communication among plants, sensors, actuators and controllers occurs in a shared communication network. NCS have been studied for the last ten years and important research results have been obtained. These results are in the area of stability and stabilizability. However, while important, these results must be complemented in different areas to be able to design effective NCS. In this paper we approach the control design of NCS using symbolic (finite) models. Symbolic models are abstract descriptions of continuous systems where one symbol corresponds to an "aggregate" of continuous states. We consider a fairly general multiple-loop network architecture where plants communicate with digital controllers through a shared, non-ideal, communication network characterized by variable sampling and transmission intervals, variable communication delays, quantization errors, packet losses and limited bandwidth. We first derive a procedure to obtain symbolic models that are proven to approximate NCS in the sense of alternating approximate bisimulation. We then use these symbolic models to design symbolic controllers that realize specifications expressed in terms of automata on infinite strings. An example is provided where we address the control design of a pair of nonlinear control systems sharing a common communication network. The closed loop NCS obtained is validated through the OMNeT++ network simulation framework.

Initially, by using a set of logical switched functions, the original MNN is transformed into another model which is easy to be dealt with. Then, based on the transformed model and using the Lyapunov direct method, a mixed H-2/H-infinity control design is developed in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), such that the closed-loop MNN is exponentially stable and an H-2 performance bound is given while providing a prescribed H-infinity performance of disturbance attenuation. Furthermore, via the existing LMI optimization technique, a suboptimal mixed H-2/H-infinity controller can be constructed in the sense of making the H-2 performance bound as small as possible. Finally, numerical simulations exhibit the feasibility and validity of the proposed design method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Research on the optimization of logistics network model is helpful to reduce the waste of routes, improve the utilization rate of transportation tools and hubs, and thus reduce the organizational cost of logistics. In this paper, the basic model of hub-and-spoke network (HSN) is constructed based on the principle of minimizing the connection distance and total cost between hubs. By discretizing the particles in the continuous motion space, the discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed and the Exchange () exchange function is used to improve its search strategy to update the individual optimal value and the global optimal value. Finally, the improved double-layer discrete PSO algorithm is obtained to solve the logistics network model. The results show that the optimized PSO algorithm has faster convergence speed and higher precision, and the application of the logistics network model is helpful to integrate logistics resources, reduce logistics costs, and improve logistics efficiency.					zhang, ailing/KJL-5844-2024														1687-5265	1687-5273				JUL 8	2022	2022								1862911	10.1155/2022/1862911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/1862911								35845888					WOS:000849799900001

On the use of mathematical programs with complementarity constraints in combined topological and parametric design of biochemical enzyme networks	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												A new method is presented for biochemical enzyme network design based on direct transcription and mathematical programs with complementarity constraints. Topology and continuous parameters are optimized simultaneously. The case study design objective is to optimize adaptability while maintaining sufficient sensitivity to ensure input change detection. A three-node problem is solved using both simultaneous and single-shooting approaches. The simultaneous approach enables solution of four-node problems; this is a new capability not available through existing approaches such as exhaustive enumeration, and is a step toward designing larger systems. A conventional nested solution strategy was also investigated for a four-node problem where an outer loop solves the discrete topology optimization problem, and an inner loop solves the continuous problem for each candidate topology. The simultaneous approach yields robust network topological designs that are superior to those identified through the single-shooting and nested strategies.																			0305-215X	1029-0273				FEB	2017	49	2					345	364		10.1080/0305215X.2016.1188091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0305215X.2016.1188091													WOS:000389820300010

A discrete-time open queueing network approach is applied. The data obtained from the evaluation of the lift and vehicle movements can be used directly as input for the general discrete service time distributions of the queueing network. Furthermore, the approach allows for the computation of the retrieval transaction time distribution as well as of the distribution of the number of transactions waiting to be stored. Consequently, not only expected values and variances but also quantiles of the performance measures can be obtained. Comparison to discrete-event simulation quantifies approximation errors resulting from the decomposition approach in the discrete-time domain. Moreover, the errors obtained by the discrete-time approach are compared to the errors obtained using a continuous-time open queueing network approach. Finally, it will be outlined how the model can be used for designing AVS/RSs according to given system requirements, such as storage capacity, throughput, height and length of the system as well as the 95% quantile of the retrieval transaction time.

Synchronization in a network of identical continuous- or discrete-time agents with unknown nonuniform constant input delay	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												This paper studies the synchronization problem for multiagent systems with identical continuous- or discrete-time agents with unknown nonuniform constant input delays. The agents are connected via full- or partial-state coupling. The agents are assumed to be asymptotically null controllable, ie, all eigenvalues are in the closed left-half complex plane for continuous-time agents or in the closed unit disc for discrete-time agents. We derive an upper bound for the input delay tolerance, which explicitly depends on the agent dynamics. Moreover, for any unknown delay satisfying this upper bound, a low-gain-based protocol design methodology is proposed without relying on exact knowledge of the network topology such that synchronization is achieved among agents for any network graph in a given set.																			1049-8923	1099-1239				SEP 10	2018	28	13					3959	3973		10.1002/rnc.4115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rnc.4115													WOS:000439507100008

In this contribution, Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) syntheses of water networks are performed by using various economic objectives, in order to investigate their effects on the structural, environmental, and economic characteristics of optimal water networks. Batch-semicontinuous and isothermal continuous water networks were analyzed during this study. Significant differences between optimal networks were obtained when using different economic objectives. Minimization of freshwater costs produced highly integrated designs with high levels of water reuse, regeneration reuse or recycling, but low profitability. In contrast, maximization of the internal rate of return resulted in highly profitable designs with low investment and a low level of water integration. Either minimization of the total annual cost, maximization of the net present value, or maximization of the annual profit produced designs with intermediate or high levels of integration between water using operations, and modest profitability. These criteria produced compromise solutions with proper trade-offs between the profitabilities and sustainabilities of water network designs.

Discrete-time weight updates in neural-adaptive control	SOFT COMPUTING												Typical neural-adaptive control approaches update neural-network weights as though they were adaptive parameters in a continuous-time adaptive control. However, requiring fast digital rates usually restricts the size of the neural network. In this paper we analyze a delta-rule update for the weights, applied at a relatively slow digital rate. We show that digital weight update causes the neural network to estimate a discrete-time model of the system, assuming that state feedback is still applied in continuous time. A Lyapunov analysis shows uniformly ultimately bounded signals. Furthermore, slowing the update frequency and using the extra computational time to increase the size/accuracy of the neural network results in better performance. Experimental results achieving link tracking of a two-link flexible-joint robot verify the improved performance.																			1432-7643	1433-7479				MAR	2013	17	3					431	444		10.1007/s00500-012-0918-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-012-0918-1													WOS:000314754000009

Moreover, a less conservative criterion is established to solve the dissipative state estimation problem by using matrix decomposition approach. Furthermore, to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, a dissipative estimator is designed to ensure stochastic dissipativity of the error fuzzy jump neural networks.

The optimization of existing water distribution networks has therefore often been tackled through the use of stochastic optimization procedures. However, even these suffer from the need to solve systems of nonlinear algebraic equations. This paper describes the implementation of a hybrid method which combines a fully discrete formulation and visualization procedure with mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solution methods. The discrete formulation is suitable for solution by stochastic and direct search optimization methods and provides a natural basis for visualization and, hence, user interaction. Visual hints allow a user to identify easily bottlenecks and the aspects of the design that most greatly affect the overall cost. The result is a tool which combines the global search capabilities of stochastic algorithms with the pattern recognition and tuning abilities of the user. The solutions obtained provide good initial points for subsequent optimization by rigorous MINLP solution methods.					; Papageorgiou, Lazaros/L-2122-2013	Fraga, Eric/0000-0002-5732-6082; Papageorgiou, Lazaros/0000-0003-4652-6086													1570-7946		0-444-51368-X				2003	14						119	124																WOS:000183369400020

Delay compensation, design and simulation of controllers for distributed control systems	2006 International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems, Vols 1 and 2					International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems	AUG 08-11, 2006	Peradeniya, SRI LANKA					This paper is focused on controller design for distributed control systems. The performance degradation due to time varying control delays in the loop closed through a network has been addressed by a novel predictor based delay compensation method supported by an adaptive sampling scheme when the control delay exceeds the sampling period. Both continuous and discrete time domains have been considered in the design and a methodology has been derived to transform a continuous time design to discrete time implementation without loosing performance. Since the existing simulation tools support only constant sampling frequencies, a different approach based on a set of differential equations representing the system has also been presented.

Paola Vera; McGee, John; Laubenbacher, Reinhard			Discretization of Time Series Data	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY												An increasing number of algorithms for biochemical network inference from experimental data require discrete data as input. For example, dynamic Bayesian network methods and methods that use the framework of finite dynamical systems, such as Boolean networks, all take discrete input. Experimental data, however, are typically continuous and represented by computer floating point numbers. The translation from continuous to discrete data is crucial in preserving the variable dependencies and thus has a significant impact on the performance of the network inference algorithms. We compare the performance of two such algorithms that use discrete data using several different discretization algorithms. One of the inference methods uses a dynamic Bayesian network framework, the other-a time- and state-discrete dynamical system framework. The discretization algorithms are quantile, interval discretization, and a new algorithm introduced in this article, SSD. SSD is especially designed for short time series data and is capable of determining the optimal number of discretization states. The experiments show that both inference methods perform better with SSD than with the other methods. In addition, SSD is demonstrated to preserve the dynamic features of the time series, as well as to be robust to noise in the experimental data. A C++ implementation of SSD is available from the authors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization.

J	De Mel, I; Klymenko, OV; Short, M				De Mel, Ishanki; V. Klymenko, Oleksiy; Short, Michael			Discrete optimal designs for distributed energy systems with nonconvex multiphase optimal power flow	APPLIED ENERGY												The optimal selection, sizing, and location of small-scale technologies within a grid-connected distributed energy system (DES) can contribute to reducing carbon emissions, consumer costs, and network imbalances. There is a significant lack of studies on how DES designs, especially those with electrified heating systems, impact unbalanced low-voltage distribution networks to which most DES are connected. This is the first study to present an optimisation framework for obtaining discrete technology sizing and selection for grid-connected DES design, while simultaneously considering multiphase optimal power flow (MOPF) constraints to accurately represent unbalanced low-voltage distribution networks. An algorithm is developed to solve the resulting Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) formulation. It employs a decomposition based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Nonlinear Programming (NLP) and uses integer cuts and complementarity reformulations to obtain discrete designs that are also feasible with respect to the network constraints. A heuristic modification to the original algorithm is also proposed to improve computational speed. Improved formulations for selecting feasible combinations of air source heat pumps (ASHPs) and hot water storage tanks are also presented. Two networks of varying size are used to test the optimisation methods. Designs with electrified heating (ASHPs and tanks) are compared to those with conventional gas boilers. The algorithms outperform one of the existing stateof-the-art commercial deterministic MINLP solvers, which fails to find any solutions in two instances within specified time limits. While feasible solutions were obtained for all cases, convergence was not achieved for all, especially for those involving the larger network. Where converged, the algorithm with the heuristic modification has achieved results up to 70% faster than the original algorithm. Results for case studies suggest that including ASHPs can support up to 16% higher renewable generation capacity compared to gas boilers, albeit with higher ASHP investment costs, as local generation and consumption minimises network violations associated with excess power export. The results also show the importance of including nonlinear power flow constraints in DES design problems. The optimisation framework and results can be used to inform stakeholders such as policymakers and network operators, to increase renewable energy capacity and aid the decarbonisation of domestic heating systems.

In this paper, a creative discrete-form recurrent neural network (RNN) model is developed, analyzed and investigated for solving discrete-form time-variant generalized-Sylvester matrix equation (DF-TV-GSME), which is derived by a direct discretization numerical method. Specifically, first of all, DF-TV-GSME, which includes the wellknown Lyapunov matrix equation and Sylvester matrix equation, is presented as the target problem of this research. Secondly, for solving such problem, different from the traditional discrete-form RNN design philosophy, second-order Taylor expansion is applied to derive the discrete-form RNN model. This creative process avoids involving the continuous time-variant environment and continuous-form model. Then, theoretical properties analyses are presented, which present the convergence and precision of the discrete-form RNN model. Abundant numerical experiments are further carried out with different perspectives of DF-TV-GSME, which further confirm the excellent properties of discrete-form RNN model.

The continuous-time neural network is shown to have a global stability, including the global asymptotic and exponential stability. The discrete-time neural network is shown to have, a global convergence with a fixed step length. This fixed step length can be independent of the regression problem size by scaling a design parameter. Since the sizes of the proposed neural networks depend only on the constraints of the optimization problems, the proposed new regression estimator can obtained by two novel neural networks with lower implementation costs than the conventional methods.

Conventional optimization techniques often easily get bogged down in local optima and cannot successfully address such problems. In the past decades, heuristic algorithms with robust and efficient global-search capabilities have helped to solve continuous and discrete optimization problems and have demonstrated considerable promise. This study applied tabu search (TS) and simulated annealing (SA) to the optimization of sewer-network designs. As a case study, it applied to solve a benchmark sewer network optimization problem reported in the literature. The optimal configuration of TS and SA parameters were determined by systematically evaluating the relative computational performance of TS and SA. Characteristic analysis was undertaken and solution qualities from different algorithms were also compared. The results show that SA is able to obtain optimal sewer network designs better than those methods previously reported in the literature.																			2157-3611		978-1-4799-0986-5				2013							1636	1640																WOS:000395631500325

J	Afshar, MH; Rohani, M				Afshar, M. H.; Rohani, M.			Optimal design of sewer networks using cellular automata-based hybrid methods: Discrete and continuous approaches	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												In this article, cellular automata based hybrid methods are proposed for the optimal design of sewer networks and their performance is compared with some of the common heuristic search methods. The problem of optimal design of sewer networks is first decomposed into two sub-optimization problems which are solved iteratively in a two stage manner. In the first stage, the pipe diameters of the network are assumed fixed and the nodal cover depths of the network are determined by solving a nonlinear sub-optimization problem. A cellular automata (CA) method is used for the solution of the optimization problem with the network nodes considered as the cells and their cover depths as the cell states. In the second stage, the nodal cover depths calculated from the first stage are fixed and the pipe diameters are calculated by solving a second nonlinear sub-optimization problem. Once again a CA method is used to solve the optimization problem of the second stage with the pipes considered as the CA cells and their corresponding diameters as the cell states. Two different updating rules are derived and used for the CA of the second stage depending on the treatment of the pipe diameters. In the continuous approach, the pipe diameters are considered as continuous variables and the corresponding updating rule is derived mathematically from the original objective function of the problem. In the discrete approach, however, an adhoc updating rule is derived and used taking into account the discrete nature of the pipe diameters. The proposed methods are used to optimally solve two sewer network problems and the results are presented and compared with those obtained by other methods. The results show that the proposed CA based hybrid methods are more efficient and effective than the most powerful search methods considered in this work.

As is well known, such networks have very constrained Lyapunov-function controlled dynamics. Nevertheless, we show that they are universal and efficient computational devices, in the sense that any convergent synchronous fully parallel computation by a recurrent network of n discrete-time binary neurons, with in general asymmetric coupling weights, can be simulated by a symmetric continuous-time Hopfield net containing only 18n + 7 units employing the saturated-linear activation function. Moreover, if the asymmetric network has maximum integer weight size w(max) and converges in discrete time t*, then the corresponding Hopfield net can be designed to operate in continuous time Theta (t* /epsilon) for any epsilon > 0 such that w(max)2(12n) less than or equal to epsilon2(1/epsilon). In terms of standard discrete computation models, our result implies that any polynomially space-bounded Turing machine can be simulated by a family of polynomial-size continuous-time symmetric Hopfield nets.

J	Wan, YM; Wang, W; Ye, H				Wan, Yiming; Wang, Wei; Ye, Hao			Integrated design of residual generation and evaluation for fault detection of networked control systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												In this paper, integrated design of residual generation and evaluation is proposed to fault detection (FD) of networked control systems. Both the imperfect network transmissions and the sampling effects are considered under the assumption that no stochastic network model is available. By deriving a linear discrete time-varying system equivalent to the sampled plant, the continuous-time behaviors of disturbances and faults during sampling intervals are captured. Moreover, the effects of unknown but bounded packet delays and dropouts in the controller-to-actuator link are described by uncertain input delays with finite number of possibilities. A parity relation-based FD module with multiple residuals is constructed for the derived system model. For the constructed FD module, the set of undetectable faults is obtained from integrated analysis of residual generation and evaluation and then designed to achieve its worst-case minimal geometrical size while guaranteeing zero false alarms. Simulation results on a networked three-tank system are provided to show the merits of the proposed integrated design approach. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

By considering the controlled plant as a class of unknown nonlinear discrete-time systems, the affine data-driven model (ADM) is developed by a multi-input fuzzy rule emulated network (MiFREN) when the property of a continuous function is omitted. Therefore, the controller is established by the result of ADM when the specification of tracking error can be designed by the prescribed boundaries. The theoretical principle is utilized for the closed-loop analysis which guarantees the performance by designing the setting parameters. For the practical aspect, the design procedure and the performance are demonstrated by the experimental results.

We consider a scenario that the measurement output may contain the unexpected outliers. In order to attenuate the impact of measurement outliers on the state estimation performance, a stubborn state estimator is designed for discrete-time CVNNs. For the purpose of analysis and synthesis, the CVNNs under consideration are firstly transformed to an augmented system which includes the dynamics of the real and imaginary parts of original CVNNs. Then, by resorting to the Lyapunov functional approach, a sufficient condition is given to ensure that the estimation error system is asymptotically stable. Subsequently, the desired state estimator gain is determined by solving a set of matrix inequalities. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stubborn state estimation scheme.					liu, yufei/AAJ-1743-2021	liu, yufei/0000-0002-5253-0850; Shen, Bo/0000-0003-3482-5783													0941-0643	1433-3058				APR	2022	34	7			SI		5449	5464		10.1007/s00521-021-06707-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06707-y		NOV 2021											WOS:000717910900004

Using a constant sampling period and an extension of the Taylor series expansion applied to the exponential of a parameter-dependent matrix, a discretized model whose matrices depend polynomially on the time-varying parameters that are used to schedule the control gain is obtained. The discrete-time model also has additive norm bounded terms, representing the discretization errors, and a network-induced delay in the control signal. A two-step strategy based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions is then proposed to synthesize a digital static scheduled output feedback control law that stabilizes both the discretized and the original continuous-time LPV system. The conditions can also be used to provide robust (i.e., independent of the scheduling parameter) static output feedback controllers. The viability of the proposed design method is illustrated through a numerical example.					de Freitas Morais, Cecília/N-1946-2018; Oliveira, Ricardo/JBJ-2175-2023; Oliveira, Ricardo C.L.F./A-8285-2008; Oliveira, Ricardo/GVS-4393-2022; Braga, Marcio/ABA-9939-2021; Tognetti, Eduardo Stockler S/Q-9740-2017; Peres, Pedro L.

This paper presents a single-objective deterministic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design problem consisting of plants, collection centers, disposal centers, and customer zones. Our model minimizes the total costs comprising fixed opening cost of plants, collection, disposal centers, and transportation costs of products among the nodes. As supply chain network design problems belong to the class of NP-hard problems, a novel league championship algorithm (LCA) with a modified priority-based encoding is applied to find a near-optimal solution. New operators are defined for the LCA to search the discrete space. Numerical comparison of our proposed encoding with the existing approaches in the literature is indicative of the high quality performance of the proposed encoding.

Intelligent control of chaos using linear feedback controller and neural network identifier	COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION												A method for controlling chaos when the mathematical model of the system is unknown is presented in this paper. The controller is designed by the pole placement algorithm which provides a linear feedback control method. For calculating the feedback gain, a neural network is used for identification of the system from which the Jacobian of the system in its fixed point can be approximated. The weights of the neural network are adjusted online by the gradient descent algorithm in which the difference between the system output and the network output is considered as the error to be decreased. The method is applied on both discrete-time and continuous-time systems. For continuous-time systems, equivalent discrete-time systems are constructed by using the Poincare map concept. Two discrete-time systems and one continuous-time system are tested as examples for simulation and the results show good functionality of the proposed method. It can be concluded that the chaos in systems with unknown dynamics may be eliminated by the presented intelligent control system based on pole placement and neural network. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Elhedhli, S; Wang, Y; Saif, A				Elhedhli, Samir; Wang, Yan; Saif, Ahmed			Service system design with immobile servers, stochastic demand and concave-cost capacity selection	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												The service system design problem is a location-allocation problem with service quality considerations that is often modeled as a network of M/M/1 queues to minimize facility setup, customer access, and waiting costs. Traditionally, capacity decisions are either ignored or modeled as a selection among discrete capacity levels. In this work, we study the general continuous capacity case and account for economies-of-scale in its cost through an increasing concave function. We focus on the special square root case that has been shown to model capacity in terms of the number of servers needed under Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program with concave and convex terms in the objective function. Two novel resolution approaches are proposed: In the first, the problem is reformulated as a mixed-integer quadratic program with fourth-degree polynomial equality constraints. These constraints and the quadratic objective function are approximated using piecewise-linear segments. In the second, we use Lagrangian relaxation to decompose the problem and reformulate the subproblems as second-order cone programs that are solved at multiple utilization levels. The Lagrangian multipliers are updated using a cutting-plane method and a feasible solution is obtained by solving the corresponding set-covering formulation. The solution approaches are tested and compared. The linearization approach provides high quality solutions within short computational times for small instances and lower accuracy; whereas the Lagrangian approach scales well as size increases.

The focus is on the use of a deposit-refund requirement by the government when the collection rate voluntarily achieved by the firms is deemed insufficient. We present a continuous modeling framework for designing a drop-off facility network and determining the sales price that maximize the firm's profit under a given deposit-refund. The customers' preferences with regards to purchasing and returning the product are incorporated via a discrete choice model with stochastic utilities. Through parametric analyses, we determine the net value that can be recovered from a returned product as a key driver for the firm to voluntarily engage in collection. We show that a minimum deposit-refund requirement would not achieve high collection rates for products with low return value and point out two complementary policy tools that can be used by the government.

J	Vaisman, R				Vaisman, Radislav			Subset selection via continuous optimization with applications to network design	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Choosing a subset of representative items from a set of alternatives is an important problem in many scientific fields such as environmental science and statistics. For most practical problems, however, a computationally efficient solution method is not known to exist. While this problem has attracted a significant amount of attention, the majority of specifically designed algorithms do not scale well with respect to the problem size or do not provide a usable open-source package. In this study, we show that any global continuous optimization technique can be used for solving the representative subset selection problem. The latter is achieved by designing a simple transformation which embeds the problem's discrete space into a larger continuous space.

A delay-dependent sufficient condition containing several simple inequalities is first proposed to guarantee that the state trajectories remain inside or converge globally exponentially into a Cartesian product of two polytopes under the minimal dwell-time constraint. Second, the reachable set estimation problem is further studied, and another reachable set estimation condition can be derived. Based on the reachable set estimation result, state-feedback controllers are designed such that the state trajectories of the closed-loop system are limited in a given Cartesian product of two polytopes. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.																			0170-4214	1099-1476				APR	2023	46	6					6416	6439		10.1002/mma.8914	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mma.8914		NOV 2022											WOS:000891390600001

The infinite distributed delay is introduced in the discrete networked domain. Also, it is assumed that system state is quantized before being communicated and the quantization error is described as sector bounded uncertainty. Moreover, a compensation scheme is proposed to deal with the effect of random packet dropout through communication network. Then, by constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional that accounts for mixed time delays, sufficient conditions for the existence of an admissible controller are established to ensure the asymptotical stability of the resulting closed loop system. Especially, the cone complementary linearization approach is exploited to solve the nonconvex feasibility problem. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed design method in this paper.

We model the packet delivery characteristics of the network as a four-state Markov process and note that the results for discrete-time linear systems with Markovian jumping parameters can be applied. We focus on the design problem of a full-order H-infinity filter such that for all possible uncertain measurements the filtering error dynamics is exponentially mean square stable and a prescribed H-infinity performance bound is guaranteed. Necessary and sufficient bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) condition for the synthesis of the aforementioned filter for a discrete-time jump system is presented.

We have developed an MRM framework to support hierarchical modeling as exemplified for Network-on-Chip (NoC) systems, as exemplar of network systems, with support for both validation and verification. Throughout the design phase, fine-grain models are created using their coarse-grain counterparts. Each model can be validated using discrete-event simulation and verified using model checking. We propose Constrained-DEVS, a variant of the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism, which supports model checking in addition to DEVS's discrete-event simulation capability. Appropriate execution protocols for mixed V&V (validation and verification) are proposed. This leads to an MRM framework enabling both simulation and model checking.

However, current models are network-based and presume that travelers can choose between a finite number of discrete route alternatives. For walking facilities, where pedestrians can choose their paths freely in two-dimensional space, applicability of these traditional network models is limited. This contribution puts forward an approach for user-optimal dynamic assignment in continuous time and space for analyzing walking infrastructure. Contrary to network-based approaches, the theory allows the traffic units to choose from an infinite non-countable set of paths through the considered space. The approach consists of three interrelated steps, that is: determining the continuous paths using a path choice model, assigning the origin-destination flows, and calculating the resulting traffic conditions. The approach to determine a user-optimal assignment is heuristic and consists of a sequence of all-or-nothing assignments in continuous time-space. The article presents the mathematical problem formulation, solution approaches, and application examples.																					978-962-8804-18-4				2002							87	98																WOS:000261327900008

Then the EMCACO-C employs the Gaussian random sampling to exploit further the directional solutions for finding better solutions. The methodology similarities and differences between the EMCACO-C and genetic algorithm are analyzed. The performances of the EMCACO-C for TRFN designs are verified in the simulations of five application examples including dynamic system control, dynamic system identification, and chaotic series prediction.

Our experimental results show that strict Nash networks prove to be a good indicator for predicting network formation, particularly in continuous time. In explaining our results, it turns out that, among others, the complexity in coordinating on stars, the inequity aversion against unequal payoff distribution in the network, and the groups' degrees of activity are the most important determinants for the formation of strict Nash networks.

In an IMT powertrain system, the performance of speeding tracking is of importance. It is well known that controller area network (CAN) has been a common communication medium to exchange signals between controller and physical apparatus in vehicular systems. The CAN-bus-induced delays due to the limited network capacity are a challenge to the speed tracking control for the IMT systems involving varieties of CAN communication nodes. In this paper, we aim to design a tracking controller for IMT powertrain systems by considering the CAN-bus-induced delays. To achieve the objective, the discrete-time system model of IMT powertrain systems coupled with the influence of CAN-bus-induced delays is analyzed. Then, a new system augmentation method considering the integral of error is applied to the obtained discrete-time system. With the augmentation technique, the tracking controller design is transformed into a state-feedback controller design for the augmented closed-loop system. In addition, the mixed H-infinity and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) performance is considered and a design approach for robust mixed H-infinity/LQR controller is proposed. Finally, simulation and comparison results are carried out. Compared with a conventional proportional-integral controller and an L-2 - L-infinity controller, the superiority and the improvement of proposed controller are displayed.

J	Gao, Y; Xue, HM; Zhang, L; Sun, EC				Gao, Ying; Xue, Hongmei; Zhang, Long; Sun, Enchang			UAV Trajectory Design and Power Optimization for Terahertz Band-Integrated Sensing and Communications	SENSORS												Sixth generation (6G) wireless networks require very low latency and an ultra-high data rate, which have become the main challenges for future wireless communications. To effectively balance the requirements of 6G and the extreme shortage of capacity within the existing wireless networks, sensing-assisted communications in the terahertz (THz) band with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. In this scenario, the THz-UAV acts as an aerial base station to provide information on users and sensing signals and detect the THz channel to assist UAV communication. However, communication and sensing signals that use the same resources can cause interference with each other. Therefore, we research a cooperative method of co-existence between sensing and communication signals in the same frequency and time allocation to reduce the interference. We then formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total delay by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, frequency association, and transmission power of each user. The resulting problem is a non-convex and mixed integer optimization problem, which is challenging to solve. By resorting to the Lagrange multiplier and proximal policy optimization (PPO) method, we propose an overall alternating optimization algorithm to solve this problem in an iterative way. Specifically, given the UAV location and frequency, the sub-problem of the sensing and communication transmission powers is transformed into a convex problem, which is solved by the Lagrange multiplier method. Second, in each iteration, for given sensing and communication transmission powers, we relax the discrete variable to a continuous variable and use the PPO algorithm to tackle the sub-problem of joint optimization of the UAV location and frequency. The results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the delay and improves the transmission rate when compared with the conventional greedy algorithm.

Extensive experimentation with a multitude of networks and comparison with a conventional simulator show that the model is quite fast and accurate, thus becoming a promising candidate for design purposes.

First, based on the bilinear transform and Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, we propose a general five-step third-order Zhang dynamic (ZeaD) formula, which is shown to be convergent with the truncation error O(tau(3)) with tau > 0 the sampling gap. Second, based on the designed ZeaD formula and the continuous-time Zhang dynamic design formula, a general five-step discrete-time Zhang neural network (DTZNN) model with quartic steady-state error pattern is presented for TVNO, which includes many multi-step DTZNN models as special cases. Third, based on the Jury criterion, we derive the effective domain of step size in the DTZNN model, which determines its convergence and convergence speed. Fourth, a nonlinear programming is established to determine the optimal step size. Finally, simulation results and discussions are given to validate the theoretical results obtained in this paper.

The ability to predict their EMC compliance to standard immunity tests in design phase is required. The paper focuses on an AMS modeling procedure allowing to describe the CAN bus behaviour when affected by disturbances. The network is simulated combining mixed-signal models of CAN transceiver, cables and noise injection circuits, correctly assessing at system level the relationship between analog and digital signals. The obtained model efficiently predicts the influence of a continuous wave disturbance and estimates the immunity graph obtained through standard testing in a design phase. An application example on a real CAN network concludes the paper and confirms its ability to assess EMC problems.																			2158-110X		978-1-4799-3226-9				2014							795	800																WOS:000364988600146

Among followers, the communication topology is assumed to be undirected and connected. Two networked observability conditions are introduced and discussed. The first one extends the traditional detectability condition for a single system, while the second one is a full rank condition, which is stronger than the first one. In the continuous-time case, two distributed observer-based protocols are designed under corresponding networked observability conditions, respectively. Specifically, the second protocol is an adaptive one, which has a better robustness performance than the first one. In the discrete-time case, a distributed observer-based protocol is presented under the full rank networked observability condition. It is found that under the networked observability conditions, consensus tracking can still be achieved even if there exists no follower being able to track the leader independently. Based on algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov stability theory, some sufficient conditions are derived for reaching consensus tracking. Finally, simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of theoretical results.

J	Camp, CV; Bichon, BJ				Camp, CV; Bichon, BJ			Design of space trusses using ant colony optimization	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING												A design procedure utilizing an ant colony optimization (ACO) technique is developed for discrete optimization of space trusses. The objective function considered is the total weight (or cost) of the structure subjected to material and performance constraints in the form of stress and deflection limits. The design of space trusses using discrete variables is transformed into a modified traveling salesman problem (TSP) where the network of the TSP reflects the structural topology and the length of the TSP tour is the weight of the structure. The resulting truss, mapped into a TSP, is minimized using an ACO algorithm. The ACO design procedure uses discrete design variables, an open format for prescribing constraints, a penalty function to enforce design constraints, and allows for multiple loading cases. A comparison is presented between the ACO truss design procedure and designs developed using a genetic algorithm and classical continuous optimization methods.

The mixed time delays include discrete and distributed delays. Due to the constraint of physical devices, the measurement outputs are partially nonlinear and subjected to sensor saturations. In order to save the limited communication resource, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism is employed to determine whether or not the current sampled data should be transmitted. Data quantization is also an effective way to decrease the amount of transmitted data via networks. Some delay-dependent sufficient conditions have been derived to guarantee the augmented estimator system is asymptotic stable and achieve the prescribed L-2-L-infinity performance. The design process of L-2-L-infinity estimator is also derived. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute.

We hypothesized that local sources of reflection introduce trends of global reflection into the input impedance spectra. These trends are related to the network topology, geometry, and design according to R(b) = R(d)(x), where R(b) is the branching ratio, R(d) is the diameter ratio, and x is the fractal dimension quantifying design. Simulations using values of R(d) and x, which were derived morphometrically, confirmed two patterns of global reflection: a continuous trend attributed to a single effective site of reflection caused by frequency-dependent sources of impedance contrast and a discrete trend arising from a longitudinal distribution of frequency-independent sources of reflection. The continuous trend depended only on the network parameter R(d), whereas the discrete trend depended on R(d) and x. Our results indicate that the impedance-matching properties of a deterministic pulmonary fractal network encode arterial geometry and topology via function and that typical values of R(d) and x for the pulmonary circulation facilitate shear stress amplification in its peripheral vessels. Thus, inasmuch as shear forces may be involved in the endothelial mechanisms for pathological, or physiological, vascular remodeling, broadband input impedance analysis may reveal interactions between network organization and vascular function.																			8750-7587					MAR	1996	80	3					1033	1056		10.1152/jappl.1996.80.3.1033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1996.80.3.1033								8964721					WOS:A1996UE82500044

Sampled-data system with time-delay in its discrete-time subsystem shows some nice features to admit many network-induced topics, for example, time-delay, packet dropout. Beside of the networked control systems with different combinations of the time-driven or event-driven mode of the devices, including the samplers, the controllers and the holders, this work concerns with the networks with multirate devices. By transforming the time-delay in the discrete-time subsystem into the continuous-time singular subsystem, a less conservative time-delay dependent stability result for the networked singular control systems is obtained. The stability condition guarantees that the networked singular system is regular, impulse free and stable. Furthermore, a stabilized control law for the networked singular systems is presented. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed techniques.																			2078-0958		978-988-98671-0-2				2008							927	932																WOS:000263417100174

Optimization of water distribution networks using a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												In the present work, a model is presented for the optimization of water distribution networks (WDN). The developed model can be used to verify node pressures, head losses, and fluid flow rate and velocity in each pipe. The algorithm is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO), considering real and discrete variables and avoiding premature convergence to local optima using objective function penalization. The model yields the minimum cost of the network, the node pressures and the velocities in the pipes. The pressures and velocities are calculated using the hydraulic simulator Epanet.

J	Gokbayrak, K; Avci, H				Gokbayrak, Kagan; Avci, Harun			A voltage drop limited decentralized electric power distribution network	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												We consider a decentralized electric power distribution network design problem in rural areas with no existing infrastructure. While the source facilities can be located anywhere on the continuous space, the demand points are connected to these source facilities on a tree topology. Since excessive voltage drops cause problems with the appliances at the demand points, we employ a limitation on the voltage drop as a constraint in our distribution network design. Given the locations of demand points on a plane, we formulate a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained programming model for our design problem. Since this problem can be solved for only very small instances, we propose seven alternative heuristic methods that initially decompose the set of demand points into clusters that can be served by a single source facility. Then, for each cluster, these methods tackle the problems of locating the source facility on the continuous space and designing the voltage drop-limited minimum spanning tree to serve all demand points in the cluster by a single facility. We select the solution method based on the size of each cluster; alternative methods can be employed for different sized clusters of the same problem. We use numerical examples to demonstrate the benefits of the tree topology networks obtained by each method compared to the star topology distribution networks for the same clusters.

Moreover, two numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness and high precision of the proposed ten-instant-type discrete gradient zeroing neural network algorithms. In the end, comparison simulations for solving the path-tracking problem of the PUMA560 robot arm are further performed to substantiate the applicability, validity, and superiority of the proposed ten-instant-type discrete gradient-zeroing neural network algorithms.(c) 2023 The Franklin Institute.

Towards the development of a tractable approach for high dimensional nonlinear systems, an existing optimization-based technique for residual generator design is reviewed. However, this requires that both system dynamics and measurements are in the same time scale, i.e., either continuous or discrete. To this end, we investigate different variants of discrete-time modeling approaches for state-space systems, specifically tailored to meet the needs of the existing FDI filter design methodology. Finally, the efficiency and limitations of the presented scheme are illustrated through simulation results for a two-area power system network, in which the objective is the diagnosis of a cyber attack at the Automatic Generation Control signal.																			0743-1546		978-1-4673-5717-3				2013							194	199																WOS:000352223500032

This paper studies the effect of topology on the linear time-invariant dynamics of power networks. For a variety of stability metrics, a unified framework based on the H-2-norm of the system is presented. The proposed framework assesses the robustness of power grids to small disturbances and is used to study the optimal placement of new lines on existing networks as well as the design of radial (tree) and meshed (loopy) topologies for new networks. Although the design task can be posed as a mixed-integer semidefinite program (MI-SDP), its performance does not scale well with network size. Using McCormick relaxation, the topology design problem can be reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To improve the computation time, graphical properties are exploited to provide tighter bounds on the continuous optimization variables. Numerical tests on the IEEE 39-bus feeder demonstrate the efficacy of the optimal topology in minimizing disturbances.

This class of systems naturally occurs when continuous processes are observed through digital sensors and information is sent via a network to a computer for state estimation. Since the network introduces variations in the sampling time, the observer must be designed so that it takes them into account. Here impulsive observers, which make instantaneous correction when information is received, are investigated. Moreover, we consider time-varying observer gains adapting to the varying sampling interval. In order to deal with both continuous-time and discrete time dynamics, a new hybrid model is used to state the problem and establish the convergence of the proposed observer. First, generic conditions are provided using a hybrid Lyapunov function. Then, a restriction of the generic Lyapunov function is used to establish tractable conditions that allows the analysis and synthesis of an impulsive gain.

However, Raman scattering imposes a limit on the optical power, which in turn impacts the network capacity for classical traffic in presence of CV-QKD. Network-planning simulations indicate that maxing out the CV-QKD capacity in an optical link can adversely impact its classical capacity. Although preliminary, these results show that designing a mixed classical and CV-QKD network will require dedicated planning heuristics and tools that specifically seek a compromise between classical and CV-QKD traffics.

Both global asymptotic and exponential stabilities are considered. The existence of the periodic solutions of the addressed neural networks is briefly discussed. Then, by constructing different Lyapnuov--Krasovskii functionals and using some analysis techniques, several new easy-to-test sufficient conditions are derived, respectively, for checking the globally asymptotic stability and globally exponential stability of the delayed neural networks. These results are useful in the design and applications of globally exponentially stable and periodic oscillatory neural circuits for recurrent neural networks with mixed time delays.

For the phenomenon of medium access constraint, the measurement transmitted from sensors to the estimator is subjected to the TOD scheduling protocol. The mixed compensation is proposed to flexibly compensate those missing measurements caused by the TOD protocol. By using a novel polytopic uncertain model, a reliable state estimator is designed, where the gain matrix is determined by two vertex matrices. Then sufficient conditions are established, which ensure the error system meets the stochastic stability and the l2-l1 performance.

In this paper, our focus is on exponential synchronization for a class of complex networks. Under certain conditions, a feedback control and stochastic periodically intermittent noise are designed to synchronize the networks. Such synchronization scheme needs less control energy due to the usage of the intermittent noise. The threshold of intermittent rate for synchronization scheme is derived. Moreover, the noise states are observed in discrete-time mode, which reduces the complexity and the computation burden for continuous observations. The observation supremum is obtained by solving a transcendental equation. Finally, a simulation example is provided, and the comparison results with some existing methods illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed new design strategy.

J	Hermans, M; Schrauwen, B				Hermans, Michiel; Schrauwen, Benjamin			Memory in linear recurrent neural networks in continuous time	NEURAL NETWORKS												Reservoir Computing is a novel technique which employs recurrent neural networks while circumventing difficult training algorithms. A very recent trend in Reservoir Computing is the use of real physical dynamical systems as implementation platforms, rather than the customary digital emulations. Physical systems operate in continuous time, creating a fundamental difference with the classic discrete time definitions of Reservoir Computing. The specific goal of this paper is to study the memory properties of such systems, where we will limit ourselves to linear dynamics. We develop an analytical model which allows the calculation of the memory function for continuous time linear dynamical systems, which can be considered as networks of linear leaky integrator neurons. We then use this model to research memory properties for different types of reservoir. We start with random connection matrices with a shifted eigenvalue spectrum, which perform very poorly. Next, we transform two specific reservoir types, which are known to give good performance in discrete time, to the continuous time domain. Reservoirs based on uniform spreading of connection matrix eigenvalues on the unit disk in discrete time give much better memory properties than reservoirs with random connection matrices, where reservoirs based on orthogonal connection matrices in discrete time are very robust against noise and their memory properties can be tuned. The overall results found in this work yield important insights into how to design networks for continuous time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike most work in this area which deal with networks without inter-AP interference, we reveal that association control alone is not sufficient to achieve fair throughput allocation and load balancing across APs. Instead, we advocate the joint association control, rate control and contention control to improve network performance. Based on this, we formulate a cross-layer optimization problem whose objective is to allocate downlink throughput according to the proportional fairness principle. As the problem turns out to be a non-convex mixed integer programming problem, which is known to be NP-hard, we relax it into a continuous convex problem and propose a distributed algorithm to solve it. We then design a simple yet effective distributed approximation algorithm to construct an solution that fulfills the discrete integral association constraint. The output of the algorithm provides the optimal association, the maximum achievable rate for each downlink flow and each AP's optimal average backoff time. Numerical experiments and simulation results show that our algorithm converges rapidly and works effectively.																					978-1-4503-0274-6				2010							210	217																WOS:000287115700027

We assume the dynamical system to be partitioned into disjoint areas, and we let each area be equipped with a control center. Each control center knows local dynamics, collects local observations, performs local computation, and communicates with neighboring control centers at discrete times. For our continuous-discrete estimation algorithm we prove convergence, we characterize its convergence rate, and we show robustness against discretization and communication errors. Our technical approach is inspired by waveform relaxation methods and combines tools from estimation theory, decentralized control theory, and parallel computation.

Since the complexity of online optimization and the overhead for channel estimation scale with the size of the phase-shift codebook, the design of small codebooks is of high importance. We consider both continuous and discrete phase-shift designs and formulate the codebook construction as optimization problems. To solve the optimization problems, we propose an optimal algorithm for the discrete phase-shift design and a locally optimal solution for the continuous design. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms facilitate the construction of codebooks of different sizes and with different beamwidths. Moreover, the performance of the discrete phase-shift design with 2-bit quantization is shown to approach that of the continuous phase-shift design. Finally, our simulation results show that the proposed designs enable large transmit power savings compared to the existing linear and quadratic codebook designs.

It has been widely used and applied in image-processing tasks. However, most algorithms focus on designing more complex structures to enhance performance, ignoring learning frequency information. Moreover, existing methods are designed for SR tasks with specific scales, such as scales of 2 and 4. It limits the network performance in applications. To alleviate the above issues, this letter designs a multilevel wavelet learning network (MWLN) for continuous-scale remote-sensing image SR. MWLN achieves continuous magnification remote-sensing image SR tasks without training at different scales multiple times through multilevel wavelet feature aggregation (MWFA) and self-learning implicit representation (SLIR). MWFA extracts hierarchical features and applies discrete wavelet transforms (DWTs), capturing high-frequency information while avoiding information loss. Moreover, this letter cascades a multidimensional attention mechanism model channel and spatial features and enhances features' interaction.

J	Carvalho, SR; Moreno, UF				Carvalho, Sidney Roberto; Moreno, Ubirajara Franco			Optimal design for manipulation of random consensus over discrete information in networked systems	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												In distributed and cooperative systems, the network structure is determinant to the success of the strategy adopted to solve complex tasks. Those systems are primarily governed by consensus protocols whose convergence is intrinsically dependent on the network topology. Most of the consensus algorithms deal with continuous values and perform average-based strategies to reach cohesion over the exchanged information. However, many problems demand distributed consensus over countable values, that cannot be handled by traditional protocols. In such a context, this work presents an approach based on semidefinite programming to design the optimal weights of a network adjacency matrix, in order to control the convergence of a distributed random consensus protocol for variables at the discrete-space domain, based on the voter model. As a second contribution, this work uses Markov theory and the biological inspiration of epidemics to find out a dynamical spreading model that can predict the information diffusion over this discrete consensus protocol. Also, convergence properties and equilibrium points of the proposed model are presented regarding the network topology. Finally, extensive numerical simulations evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed consensus algorithm, its spreading model, and the approach for optimal weight design.

J	Nakao, H; Shen, SQ; Chen, ZH				Nakao, Hideaki; Shen, Siqian; Chen, Zhihao			Network design in scarce data environment using moment-based distributionally robust optimization	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												We consider a network design problem (NDP) under random demand with unknown distribution for which only a small number of observations are known. We design arc capacities in the first stage and optimize single-commodity network flows after realizing the demand in the second stage. The objective is to minimize the total cost of allocating arc capacities, flowing commodities, and penalty for unmet demand. We formulate a distributionally robust NDP (DR-NDP) by constructing an ambiguity set of the unknown demand distribution based on marginal moment information, to minimize the worst-case total cost over all possible distributions. Approximating polynomials with piecewise-linear functions, we reformulate DR-NDP as a mixed-integer linear program optimized via a cutting-plane algorithm. We test diverse network instances to compare DR-NDP with a stochastic programming approach, a deterministic benchmark model, and a robust NDP formulation. Our results demonstrate adequate robustness of optimal DR-NDP solutions and how they perform under varying demand, modeling parameter, network, and cost settings. The results highlight potential niche uses of DR-NDP in data-scarce contexts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In such models, nodes represent locations at distinct points in time and arcs represent possible actions, e.g., moving from one location to another at a particular point of time, or staying in the same location for a period of time. To use a time-expanded network, time must be discretized, i.e., the planning horizon is partitioned into discrete time intervals. The length of these intervals, therefore, must be chosen, and the parameters involving time, e.g., travel duration and due times, need to be mapped to these discrete intervals. Short intervals yield a high-quality approximation to the continuous-time problem, but typically induce a computationally intractable model; whereas long intervals can yield a computationally tractable, but low-quality model. The loss of quality is due to the approximation introduced by the mapping of parameters involving time. To guide researchers and practitioners in their use of time-expanded networks, we explore the choice of time discretization and its impact, by means of an extensive computational study on the service network design problem. The empirical results show that in some cases the loss of quality, i.e., the relative gap between the discretized and continuous-time optimal values, can be greater than 20%. We also investigate metrics that characterize and help identify instances that are likely to be sensitive to discretization and could incur a large loss of solution quality.

The multiple delays mean that both discrete time-varying delays and distributed delays are included. Time-triggered impulsive control (TTIC) is proposed to investigate the synchronization issue of the DTCNNs based on the recently proposed impulsive control scheme for continuous neural networks with single time delays. Furthermore, a novel event-triggered impulsive control (ETIC) is designed to further reduce the communication bandwidth. By using linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique and constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions, some sufficient criteria guaranteeing the synchronization of the DTCNNs are obtained.

First, a discrete-time distributed periodic ETM is developed based on communication measurement. Under this mechanism, the signal is sampled in a periodic manner, but whether the control signal is updated or not depends on the pre-designed triggering condition. The sampling signal is designed as the communication measurement calculated by both state feedback and inner communication among nodes. Compared with the existing discrete-time ETMs, this method considers the topology connection among network nodes and avoids the continuous measurement of signals. Therefore, this mechanism effectively saves communication resources and reduces the waste of computing resources. Second, in order to analyze the serrated constraint caused by the periodic sampling error, a piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed. Third, under the distributed periodic ETM, sufficient conditions are derived for bounded synchronization of discrete-time CDNs with time-varying delay. Finally, a simulation example verifies the effectiveness and accuracy of the conclusion.

To assist the user in better understanding and analyzing the network traffic data, an interactive web-based visualization system is designed using multiple coordinated views, supporting a rich set of user interactions.

For this reason, simulation is seen as an important tool in neural network research. In this paper we present a framework for simulating neural networks as discrete event nonlinear dynamical systems. This includes neural network models whose components are described by continuous-time differential equations, or by discrete-time difference equations. Specifically, we consider the design and construction of a concurrent object-oriented discrete event simulation environment for neural networks. The use of an object-oriented language provides the data abstraction facilities necessary to support modification and extension of the simulation system at a high level of abstraction. Furthermore, the ability to specify concurrent processing supports execution on parallel architectures. The use of this system is demonstrated by simulating a specific neural network model on a general-purpose parallel computer.																			0098-5589	1939-3520				JUL	1992	18	7					551	562		10.1109/32.148474	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/32.148474													WOS:A1992JE24400002

To ensure the fairness of moving users, we maximize the minimum average user rate during the observed time by jointly optimizing UAVs' trajectories, transmission power, and user association. To effectively tackle this non-convex problem with both discrete and continuous variables, we propose a joint neural network (NN) design, where a network named advantage pointer-critic (APC) is applied to optimize discrete variables and a deep-unfolding NN is used to optimize continuous variables. Specifically, we first elaborately formulate a Markov decision process to model the user association, and then use the APC network trained by the advantage actor-critic algorithm to address it. As for the deep-unfolding NN, we first develop a block coordinate descent based algorithm to optimize UAVs' trajectories and transmission power, and then unfold this algorithm into a layer-wise NN with introduced trainable parameters. These two networks are jointly trained in an unsupervised fashion. Simulation results validate that the proposed joint NN significantly outperforms the mathematical optimization algorithm with much lower complexity.

Performance of a novel hybrid algorithm in the design of water networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT												This paper proposes a novel hybrid evolutionary-based approach, named the modified cellular automaton network design algorithm-honey-bee mating optimisation (Mcanda-HBMO) algorithm, to the optimal design of water distribution systems. HBMO is a meta-heuristic approach for solving discrete and continuous optimisation problems, and Mcanda is a powerful local search algorithm that can help HBMO in better evolution. Two benchmark water distribution networks are considered in which the design variables are pipe diameters. Subsequently, the HBMO algorithm is applied to determine optimal discrete and continuous pipe sizes for the networks. Furthermore, to determine the effects of the roughness coefficient and minimum required nodal pressure on the HBMO algorithm performance, some additional information is presented to demonstrate those influences in the value of the final objective function as well as optimal pipe diameters. Moreover, in order to improve the performance of the search method, a combination of a local search algorithm with HBMO is tested in both examples. The hybrid algorithm consists of the modified Canda algorithm and pure HBMO which has had a better performance in both convergence rate and average objective functions found. The final results yielded by both HBMO and hybrid Mcanda-HBMO show the capability of these algorithms and also present some improvements in previously reported results.

In particular, the constructed abstractions are themselves also continuous-space systems with potentially lower dimensions, which can be used as replacements of the original (also known as concrete) systems in the controller design process. Having designed a controller for the abstract system, it is refined to a more detailed one for the concrete system. We use the notion of so-called simulation functions to quantify the mismatch between the original system and its approximation. Each subsystem in the concrete network and its corresponding one in the abstract network are related through a notion of local simulation functions. We show that if the local simulation functions satisfy a spectral small-gain condition, then the aggregation of the individual simulation functions provides an overall simulation function quantifying the error between the overall abstract network and the concrete one. In addition, we show that our methodology results in a scale-free compositional approach for any finite-but-arbitrarily large networks obtained from truncation of an infinite network. We provide a systematic approach to construct local abstractions and simulation functions for networks of linear switched systems. In this case, the conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities that can be efficiently computed. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through an application to AC islanded microgrids. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

On the one hand we try to find the maximum possible increase in traffic demand by setting traffic signals at individual intersections. On the other hand, we increase the road capacity in order to increase the whole capacity of a road network. In view of the characteristic of mixed traffic flow in road network, we proposed a multimodal bi-level programming model which fully considered the interaction of different vehicle classes and influence upon the network reserve capacity by budget. The proposed model was solved by a solution algorithm based on extremum disturbed and simplified Particle Swarm Optimization (dsPSO).

The mixed time delays consist of discrete and distributed delays. The measurement outputs are subject to the sensor saturations due to the physical constraints. Through the available measurement outputs, the main purpose of the addressed problem is to design a state estimator to estimate the actual neural states. In order to improve the efficiency in resource utilization, an event-triggered mechanism is employed to decide whether the received measurement output is transmitted to the state estimator. Different from the existing event-triggering strategies, the triggering condition is given for each sensor, and the measurement output from each sensor is sent according to their separate triggering conditions. By using the Lyapunov functional approach, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the estimation error dynamics is exponentially stable and the H-infinity performance requirement is satisfied. Then, the desired H-infinity state estimator is designed in terms of the solution to a linear matrix inequality that can be easily solved by the MATLAB toolboxes. Finally, one simulation example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered estimation scheme.

First, a Luenberger-type filter is designed for estimating the network states. Second, by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and using the so-called Wirtinger-based integral inequality to estimate its derivative, a delay-range-dependent and delay-rate-dependent criterion is presented to ensure the filtering error dynamic system to be exponentially stable and passive with an expected dissipation. Third, since the criterion is presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities with nonlinear constraints, a cone complementarity linearization algorithm is proposed to solve the nonlinear problem.

J	Lilleborge, M; Eidsvik, J				Lilleborge, Marie; Eidsvik, Jo			Efficient designs for Bayesian networks with sub-tree bounds	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING												We present upper and lower bounds for information measures, and use these to find the optimal design of experiments for Bayesian networks. The bounds are inspired by properties of the junction tree algorithm, which is commonly used for calculating conditional probabilities in graphical models like Bayesian networks. We demonstrate methods for iteratively improving the upper and lower bounds until they are sufficiently tight. We illustrate properties of the algorithm by tutorial examples in the case where we want to ensure optimality and for the case where the goal is an approximate solution with a guarantee. We further use the bounds to accelerate established algorithms for constructing useful designs. An example with petroleum fields in the North Sea is studied, where the design problem is related to exploration drilling campaigns. All of our examples consider binary random variables, but the theory can also be applied to other discrete or continuous distributions.

In order to predict the compressive strength of self-compacting concrete, two kinds of artificial neural networks (ANNs), including the BP (Back-propagation) networks and the hybrid networks DRGA-BP (Dimenssion reduction back-propagation based on genetic algorithm), were designed and applied in this study. With DRGA-BP, the most representative variables were selected out from many initial inputs to reduce data dimensions and also the weights and thresholds of BP model were optimized. The results showed that the hybrid model presented better prediction accuracy with the R-2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.9602, and appeared to well agree with the experimental data and was quite reliable. Finally, a mix ratio design method based on DRGA-BP model was proposed for reducing material waste and saving time in the process of concrete production with continuous adjustment.

We design a comprehensive filter that considers the network-induced defects of asynchronous switching, randomly occurring uncertainty, the quantization effect, and data packet dropout in a unified framework. A new lemma is given to overcome the design difficulty relating to the product terms of two uncertainties. By applying the average dwell time technique and the piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional technique, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the mean-square finite-time boundedness of the filtering error system with a prescribed H-infinity performance level and a filter design method is proposed.

The internal steam demand is calculated from the first principle model, and the internal electricity demand is obtained from design data. For multiperiod operation with varying demand as a series of piecewise constant for utilities, the optimal configurations of utility pumps (UP) are determined. The objective function is comprised of the operational costs for each period, transition costs and switch costs between periods. Total cost obtained from the proposed planning methodology has been reduced by 2.34% compared with the planning result without considering switch costs between periods and 3.15-9.14% compared with the result by Lee et al, (1998).

It deals with the justification of the need to prepare "logistics" experts for the field of continuous media and energies flows. The current logistics is understood as a logistics of discreet flows as well as preparation logistic specialists in current study programmes too. Individual subjects and hence the scientific and professional basis deals with the flows of discrete products, if flows are continuous, they have to be discretized. The article compares logistics of discrete and continuous flows and their identities and specifics. There are many companies in this area. Each city has gas, water, electricity, heat and sewerage networks and networks for international transport of raw materials play a strategic role today. There are no study programs that would prepare graduates for practice for the logistics in this area. The paper also includes the concept of the study program "Logistics of Continuous Media and Energies (LCME)" and design of subjects through which this programme should be implemented in the future.																					978-80-87294-88-8				2019							86	89																WOS:000563511600011

A number of basic topology control protocols exist and have been extensively analyzed. Unfortunately, most of these protocols are designed primarily for static networks and the protocol designers simply advise that the protocols should be repeated periodically to deal with failures, mobility, and other sources of dynamism. However, continuously maintaining a network topology with basic connectivity properties is a fundamental requirement for overall network dependability. Current approaches consider failures only as an afterthought or take a static fault tolerance approach, which results in extremely high energy usage and low throughput. In addition, most of the existing topology control protocols assume that transmission power is a continuous variable and, therefore, nodes can choose an arbitrary power value between some minimum and maximum powers. However, wireless network interfaces with dynamic transmission power control permit the power to be set to one of a discrete number of possible values. This simple restriction complicates the design of the topology control protocol substantially. In this paper, we present a set of topology control protocols, which work with discrete power levels and for which we specify a version that deals specifically with dynamic networks that experience failures, mobility, and other dynamic conditions. Our protocols are also novel in the sense that they are the first to consider explicit coordination between neighboring nodes, which results in more efficient power settings. In this paper, we present the design of these topology control protocols, and we report on extensive simulations to evaluate them and compare their performance against existing protocols. The results demonstrate that our protocols produce very similar topologies as the best protocols that assume power is a continuous variable, while having very low communication cost and seamlessly handling failures and mobility.

That includes selecting the right suppliers and determining the number and the location of plants, distribution centres and retailers. An apt design model of the supply chain is imperative for the proper function of the supply chain and consequently for making better operational decisions in an attempt of a continuous improvement. In this paper, we propose two models. The first model is a mixed-integer linear programming model which is concerned with the SCN design problem, whereas the second operational model is a mixed-integer non-linear programming model in respect to the production-distribution and inventory planning problem in a supply chain network. The number of customers and suppliers as well as their demand and capacities are assumed to be known in both models. Two steady-state genetic algorithms were implemented in MATLAB in order to solve both the design and the operational model. The results were compared with GAMS. Some examples were devised in order to demonstrate potential ways of use for the designer of the supply chain network, as well as for the supply chain manager.

The designed recurrent fuzzy system is the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK)-type recurrent fuzzy network (TRFN), in which each fuzzy rule contains feedback loops to handle dynamic system processing problems. The ECACO optimizes all of the free parameters in each recurrent fuzzy rule in a TRFN. Unlike the general ant colony optimization that finds solutions in discrete space, the ECACO finds solutions in a continuous space. The ECACO is a population-based optimization algorithm. New solutions are generated by selection, Gaussian random sampling, and elite-guided movement. To verify the performance of ECACO, three examples of dynamic plant control are simulated using ECACO-optimized TRFNs. The ECACO performance is also compared with other continuous ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithms in these simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The modeling strategy is based on the representation of structural alternatives in a state-equipment network (SEN) and its formulation as a mixed-logic dynamic optimization (MLDO) problem. Particularly, the disjunctive multistage modeling strategy by Oldenburg and Marquardt (2008) is extended to combine and organize single-stage and multistage models for representing the sequence of continuous and batch units in each structural alternative and for synchronizing dynamic profiles in input and output operations with material transference.

The evolutions of the electrical variables are determined by the state-dependent switchings, which complicate the mathematical modeling of controlled power converters. Differently from the complementarity models previously presented in the literature, the model proposed in this paper allows to represent as a linear complementarity system also closed-loop power converters, without requiring the a priori knowledge of the converter modes. A model construction procedure, not dependent on the specific converter topology, is presented. The discretization of the continuous-time model allows to formulate mixed linear complementarity problems for the computation of the control-to-output frequency response and the evolutions of both transient and steady-state currents and voltages. As illustrative examples, Z-source, boost, and buck dc-dc power converters under voltage-mode control and current-mode control operating both in continuous and discontinuous conduction modes are considered.

We focus on minimizing the total energy consumption of the network i.e., to make the network green. OFDM is a promising technology for next-generation optical networks with per-wavelength capacities higher than or equal to 100 Gbps. In addition, it can support heterogeneity in network traffic by having flexible bandwidth allocation per wavelength. The flexibility comes through the multiple subcarriers in an OFDM signal which can be modulated with the client data signals. Another paradigm for supporting traffic heterogeneity and high bandwidth demands is mixed-line-rate (MLR) networks where wavelengths can have discrete capacities of 10/40/100 Gbps which are single carrier based. In this study, we compare the energy efficiency of an OFDM-based network versus a MLR network. Our results show that OFDM outperforms MLR in terms of energy efficiency.

The randomly occurred actuator failure is also considered. According to the Lyapunov method, the sufficient conditions are achieved to ensure the synchronization of the MS FNNs, and the controller gains are designed by using the obtained results.

Robust fixed-time synchronization of discontinuous Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed time delays	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-MODELLING AND CONTROL												This paper aims to investigate the fixed-time synchronization (i.e., synchronization in fixed-time sense) of Cohen-Grossberg drive-response neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations and mixed time delays (both time-varying discrete delay and distributed delay). To accomplish the target of fixed-time synchronization, a novel discontinuous feedback control procedure is firstly designed for the response neural networks. Then, under the framework of Filippov solutions, by means of functional differential inclusions theory, inequality technique and the nonsmooth analysis theory with Lyapunov-like approach, some sufficient criteria are derived to design the control parameters for achieving fixed-time synchronization of the proposed drive-response systems. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

It can therefore be applied to systems with a high degree of non-linearity with no prior knowledge of the system dynamics. The proposed observer is a three-layer feedforward neural network that has been intensively trained using the error backpropagation learning algorithm, which includes an e-modification term to ensure robustness of the observer. A structure of the output predictor with a corrective term is added in the structure of the NN observer to overcome the problem of discrete time measurement. Simulations using MATLAB and CarSim are illustrated to demonstrate the performance of the proposed state observer strategy to reconstruct the state variables and parameters of a vehicle system.

Optimal Network Topology Design in Multi-Agent Systems for Efficient Average Consensus	49TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control				49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 15-17, 2010	Atlanta, GA	IEEE				The problem considered in the present article is optimal design of network topologies in multi-agent systems in order to make communication on the network as efficient as possible for the continuous-time average-consensus protocol. The network design problem can be posed in two different ways. (1) Assuming that the maximum communication cost, i.e. the maximum number of communication links, is known, the goal is to find the network topology which results in the fastest convergence to the consensus (in presence of communication time delays on the links). (2) If a minimum performance of the protocol is required, the design problem can be posed as finding the network with lowest possible communication cost which fulfills the required performance. In both approaches, we formulate the problem of finding the optimal communication graph among a class of directed graphs, strongly balanced digraphs, as a Mixed Integer Semidefinite Program (MISDP). By solving this MISDP, the optimal graph and the weights on communication links are obtained.																			0743-1546		978-1-4244-7746-3				2010							3877	3883		10.1109/CDC.2010.5717719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2010.5717719													WOS:000295049104071

Unlike continuous-time event-triggered mechanism (ETM) or state-dependent ETM, the discrete dual-side ETMs are firstly proposed by using plant output and controller output, respectively, which effectively reduce transmission rate of sampled data in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels. Then, the closed-loop system is modelled as a time-delay system, which characterizes effects of the dual-side ETMs and networked-induced delays in a unified framework. Based on the system model, asymptotic stability criterion satisfying H-infinity performance is derived, and conservatism is reduced by the delay decomposition method and reciprocally convex approach. Moreover, a co-design scheme is presented to design the dual-side ETMs and controller simultaneously, which is more convenient than two-step design method requiring controllers to be given a priori. Finally, examples confirm effectiveness of the proposed method.																			1598-6446	2005-4092				FEB	2018	16	1					108	119		10.1007/s12555-016-0407-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12555-016-0407-x													WOS:000426704300010

The problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon optimal adaptive learning problem, and we are able to simultaneously address the issue of designing a control and a triggering mechanism with guaranteed optimal performance by design. In order to provide a model-free solution, we adopt a Q-learning framework with a critic network to approximate the optimal cost and a zero-order hold actor network to approximate the optimal control. Since we have dynamics that evolve in continuous and discrete-time, we write the closed-loop system as an impulsive model and prove asymptotic stability of its equilibrium. Numerical simulation of an unknown unstable system is presented to show the efficacy of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Grover, C; Bansal, S				Grover, Charu; Bansal, Sangeeta			Effect of green network and emission tax on consumer choice under discrete continuous framework	ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY STUDIES												The paper considers a discrete continuous model where consumers choose quality of the product they buy as well as its usage. The product has two quality dimensions, intrinsic quality and environmental quality, that are in conflict with each other. It analyzes a two-stage game in a vertically differentiated duopoly market, where firms choose intrinsic quality in the first stage, and compete in prices in the second stage. It examines the effects of green network, and environmental regulation in the form of an emission tax on equilibrium qualities, market share, and total emissions. It shows that while both green network effect and environmental regulation, individually, improve the overall environmental quality, the effect is stronger when the tax is imposed in the presence of green network effect. Though an increase in green network effect reduces environmental quality of both firms, the market share of the cleaner firm rises at the expense of the other firm, resulting in an overall improvement of the environment. In the presence of green network effect, an emission tax improves environmental quality of both firms with market shares unaltered, thereby resulting in a reduction in total emissions. The green network effect enhances the effect of an emission tax. We also find that the environmental friendly firm benefits from the green network effect. The optimal tax is increasing in the network effect.

While it is widely used in industrial automation and the automotive area, it is rarely applied to Building Automation Systems (BAS). This work proposes the interconnection of a prominent building automation protocol, namely Building Automation and Control network (BACnet), and a simulator, PowerDEVS, to facilitate HIL testability of new and existing building automation networks. The Discrete Event Systems Specification formalism, used by PowerDEVS, is especially geared towards systems that show both discrete event and continuous state characteristics. Hence, the field of BAS is a prime candidate for such simulators. Further, the interconnection of HIL simulation and BAS via building automation networks allows for easy and location-independent testing of single field devices on one hand, and distributed BAS applications on the other hand. Therefore, design issues, and the pros and cons of a bridging solution between BAS and simulators are discussed throughout the course of this work. The paper introduces a modular software architecture for the interconnection of building automation networks and simulation. This allows for easy portability of the proposed design to other HIL simulators or building automation network protocols. The feasibility of the proposed approach is validated by means of a proof-of-concept.

Automatic pain intensity estimation is useful in a variety of applications in social and medical domains. However, the existing pain intensity estimation approaches are limited to either classifying the discrete intensity levels in pain or estimating the continuous pain intensities without considering the key-frame. The first approach suffers from abnormal fluctuations while estimating the pain intensity levels. Further, continuous pain estimation approaches suffer from low prediction capabilities. Hence, in this paper, we propose a deep hybrid network based approach to automatically estimate the continuous pain intensities by incorporating spatiotemporal information. Our approach consists of two key components, namely key-frame analyser and temporal analyser. We use one conventional and two recurrent convolutional neural networks to design key-frame and temporal analysers, respectively. Further, the evaluation on a benchmark dataset shows that our model can estimate the continuous emotions better than existing state-of-the-art methods.

Enabling large scale content distribution at a reasonable cost and without overloading the mobile core network is a crucial design goal for network operators. Nowadays, a key task for network operators is the development of efficient MCDNs due to the day-by-day video traffic increase in the network. In this paper, a novel concept of MCDN is proposed with the target of flexibly adapting the video caching and transport in the cellular network to the mobility of the users. By means of simulation we show that there exists a video chunk length which provides the best trade-off between the traffic volume generated in the network and the size of the cache in the CDN nodes.

The mixed time-delays under consideration comprise both the discrete and the distributed delays. By using the completing-the-square technique, the discrete and distributed time-delays are handled in a unified framework. Then, by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov functional, a sufficient condition is established under which the closed-loop control system is stable and an adequate performance index is guaranteed over all admissible uncertainties as well as mixed time-delays. Based on the sufficient condition, the nonlinear cost-guaranteed controller is designed and an explicit expression of the controller parameter is obtained.

The traditional H&S networks cannot respond intelligently to the demand changes. Therefore, a new network design method combining information and automation needs to be developed urgently. This paper considers a multi-hub version and proposes a hybrid network to dynamically design the hubs' locations and the straight connections between nodes. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated, and a two-stage genetic algorithm is developed to solve the small and large-scale instances of the hybrid H&S network design problem. The MILP and heuristic algorithm are tested on instances provided by an express delivery giant from China. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and economy of the hybrid H&S network and the ability of the proposed heuristic algorithm to quickly find the approximate optimal solution.																			2161-8070		978-1-6654-1873-7				2021							1689	1694		10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551642	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551642													WOS:000878693200223

Firstly, a more general mixed event-triggering scheme (ETS) is proposed. Secondly, considering the effects of the ETS and communication delays, based on the T-S fuzzy model scheme and time delay system approach, the original nonlinear NCSs is reformulated as a new event-triggered networked T-S fuzzy systems with interval time-varying delays. Sufficient conditions for uniform ultimately bound (UUB) stability are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In particular, the quantitative relation between the boundness of the stability region and the triggering parameters are studied in detail. Thirdly, a relative ETS is also provided, which can be seen as a special case of the above proposed mixed ETS. As a difference from the preceding results, sufficient conditions on the existence of desired fuzzy controller are derived to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system with reduced communication frequency between sensors and controllers. Moreover, a co-design algorithm for simultaneously determining the gain matrices of the fuzzy controller and the triggering parameters is developed. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed ETS and the effectiveness of the controller design method. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

On the basis of genetic algorithm integrated with back-propagation (BP) neural networks, taking the mobile phone as research object, an optimization design algorithm was finally designed. First, the continuous and discrete design variables that describe mobile phones were screened with methods of dimensions, coordinate label, and morphological analysis. Forty three-dimensional (3D) mobile phone models were designed by using 3D design software PROE. Accordingly, 12 representative mobile phones were selected through multidimensional scaling analysis and cluster analysis. Fourteen pairwise Kansei image words were obtained by collecting, screening, surveys, and statistical analysis method. Second, a BP neural networks model between design variables and user preference along with Kansei image words was established and verified with questionnaire survey data. Finally, the optimization design model for mobile phones was established considering design requirements and users' emotional needs. A genetic algorithm integrated with BP neural networks was used to optimize mobile phone design. The results show that the optimization scheme is superior to others, and this paper will provide design suggestion for mobile phone designers.

This paper compares rectilinear distance transportation costs for hub networks with two types of demand to investigate how well an idealized model predicts the cost for real-world demand. The idealized model approximates the transportation cost for a hub network serving a continuous uniform distribution of demand in a square service region with equal origin-destination flows. The cost for the approximation formula is compared to the optimal cost for discrete demand hub location problems. The ability of the approximation formula to predict the optimal transportation cost is measured, and the quality of the prediction is related to characteristics of the discrete demand.

An online stochastic actor-critic neural network (NN) based approach is utilized to achieve the near optimal regulation in the presence of network constraints, such as, network induced time-varying delays and random packet losses under event-based transmission of the feedback signals. The transformed nonlinear NCS in discrete-time after the incorporation the delays and packet losses is utilized for the actor-critic NN based controller design. To relax the knowledge of the control coefficient matrix, a NN based identifier is used. Event sampled state vector is utilized as NN inputs and their respective weights are updated non-periodically at the occurrence of events. Further, an event-trigger condition is designed by using the Lyapunov technique to ensure ultimate boundedness of all the closed-loop signals and save network resources and computation.

The saturation phenomenon of physical actuators is specifically considered in designing feedback controllers. By exploring the mixed-delay-dependent sector conditions in combination with the piecewise Lyapunov-like functional and the average-dwell-time switching, a sufficient condition is first established under which all trajectories of the error dynamics are bounded for admissible initial conditions and nonzero external disturbances, while the l(2)-l(infinity) performance constraint is satisfied. Furthermore, the exponential stability of the error dynamics is ensured for admissible initial conditions in the absence of disturbances. Second, by using some congruence transformations, the explicit condition guaranteeing the existence of desired controller gains is obtained in terms of the feasibility of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Then, three convex optimization problems are formulated regarding the disturbance tolerance, the l(2)-l(infinity) performance, and the initial condition set, respectively. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness and merits of the proposed results.

Transportat Res Board				The dynamic network loading problem is considered. This problem is at the heart of analytical approaches to dynamic traffic assignment models. Given path flow rate and link travel time functions, the dynamic network loading problem consists of determining time-dependent network How conditions, such as link travel times, total number of vehicles on links, and link inflow and outflow rates. The dynamic network loading problem is formulated as a continuous-time system of nonlinear equations expressing link dynamics, flow conservation, flow propagation, and boundary constraints. A discrete-time version of the continuous-time model is developed to design solution algorithms. Two solution algorithms are developed and implemented efficiently. Techniques are described that were designed to reduce memory usage and computation times of these solution algorithms. Computational results with a real-world traffic network emanating from the Amsterdam A10 beltway, containing 300 nodes, 1,500 paths, 1,000 origin-destination pairs, and 2 h of analysis period indicate that the developed computer implementations can solve the network loading problem in 2 min when a small discretization interval of 3.5 s is used.																			0361-1981		0-309-07229-8				2001		1771					191	200																WOS:000176595300024

Community detection in complex networks has attracted much attention in recent years. As an effective evolutionary computation technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has become a candidate for many optimization applications. However, PSO algorithm was originally designed for continuous optimization. In this paper, an improved simple discrete particle swarm optimization (ISPSO) algorithm and a discrete particle swarm optimization with redefined operator (IDPSO-RO) algorithm are proposed in the discrete context of community detection problem. Furthermore, a community correcting strategy is used to optimize the results. The performance of the two algorithms is tested on three real networks with known community structures. The experiment results show that ISPSO and IDPSO-RO algorithms using community correcting strategy can detect community structures more efficiently without prior knowledge about the size of communities and the number of communities.																					978-1-4799-7492-4				2015							171	178																WOS:000380444800023

Through further research and Analysis on the basic technologies of cryptography and data transmission, combined with several common data encryption algorithms and data communication methods, the Windows sock communication method and mixed encryption module of mixed encryption data transmission system are designed and studied. In this module, a pair of RSA keys are generated by the software system first, which are imported into the hybrid encryption process to encrypt the des keys randomly generated in the system, which optimizes the system design objectives and the main functions of the system. In this paper, through further careful and in-depth research on the two classical encryption algorithms DES (Data Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), we propose and design a method of heterogeneous network data security transmission based on hybrid encryption. The experiment is programmed by visual c++, and the mixed encryption data transmission system is simulated and tested. The experimental results show that the design and implementation of the hybrid encryption data transmission system overcomes the shortcomings of the previous systems, such as slow speed and difficult key transmission.

Quality-of-service (QoS) metrics are associated with the quality of fused information: throughput, delay, packet error rate, etc. Multivariate point process (MVPP) models of discrete random events in WSNs establish stochastic characteristics of optimal cross-layer protocols. Discrete-event, cross-layer interactions in mobile ad hoc network (MANET) protocols have been modeled using a set of concatenated design parameters and associated resource levels by the MVPPs. Characterization of the "best" cross-layer designs for a MANET is formulated by applying the general theory of martingale representations to controlled MVPPs. Performance is described in terms of concatenated protocol parameters and controlled through conditional rates of the MVPPs. Modeling limitations to determination of closed-form solutions versus explicit iterative solutions for ad hoc WSN controls are examined.																			1867-8211	1867-822X	978-3-642-11722-0				2010	28						762	779																WOS:000307263400052

This is a challenging goal, because it requires protocols that guarantee both unconditional security and high communication rates, while increasing the number of users. In this scenario, continuous-variable systems provide an ideal platform where high rates can be achieved by using off-the-shelf optical components. At the same time, the measurement-device independent architecture is also appealing for its feature of removing a substantial portion of practical weaknesses. Driven by these ideas, here we introduce a modular design of continuous-variable network where each individual module is a measurement-device-independent star network. In each module, the users send modulated coherent states to an untrusted relay, creating multipartite secret correlations via a generalized Bell detection. Using one-time pad between different modules, the network users may share a quantum-secure conference key over arbitrary distances at constant rate.

A sequence of random variables satisfying certain probability distributions is employed to describe the stochasticity of the coupling strengths. A redundant-channel-based data transmission mechanism is adopted to enhance the reliability of the transmission channel from the sensor to the estimator. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a state estimator for each node, such that the error dynamics achieves both the stochastic stability (with probability 1) and the prespecified mixed H-2/H-infinity performance requirement. By using the switched system theory, an extensive stochastic analysis is carried out to derive the sufficient conditions ensuring the stochastic stability as well as the mixed H-2/H-infinity performance index.

Over the past two decades, various approaches have been proposed for causal discovery from observational data. However, most of the existing methods are designed for either purely discrete or continuous data, which limit their practical usage. In this paper, we target the problem of causal structure learning from observational mixed-type data. Although there are a few methods that are able to handle mixed-type data, they suffer from restrictions, such as linear assumption and poor scalability. To overcome these weaknesses, we formulate the causal mechanisms via mixed structure equation model and prove its identifiability under mild conditions. A novel locally consistent score, named CVMIC, is proposed for causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure learning. Moreover, we propose an efficient conditional independence test, named MRCIT, for mixed-type data, which is used in causal skeleton learning and final pruning to further improve the computational efficiency and precision of our model. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed hybrid model outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.

The objective is to minimize the total inbound and outbound transportation costs and the total warehouse operation costs, which include the fixed costs related to their locations and the variable costs related to their space requirements for given service levels. Each warehouse is modeled as an M/G/c queueing system in which each storage slot acts as a server. We formulate this problem as a nonlinear mixed integer program with a probabilistic constraint. Two cases are considered. For the continuous unbounded size case, we find an approximate formula for the overflow probability and reformulate the problem into a set-covering problem. For the discrete size option case, we reformulate the problem into a capacitated connection location problem with discrete size options. Computational experiments are performed and the results show that the continuous model is appropriate for the small and median size problems and the discrete model is a good choice for the large size problems.

See AUG, 2023)	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS												Communication protocol is the rule and process of information exchange between every communication entities. It is the technical support of seamless interconnection between heterogeneous networks from SAGN (space-air-ground network). SDN (software-defined network) is a significant attempt framework on SAGN to manage all the entities. However, there are the following problems of protocol monitoring based on SDN. To define a unified monitoring framework on a heterogeneous network is difficult. What's more, demanded monitoring features are much less than the real traffic in the network. The captured features are always redundancy in the case of protocol monitoring. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method of discrete Noetherian ring variational pattern features set for SAGN protocol monitoring. We build the real time traffic model of SAGN based on discrete Noetherian ring multi-dimensional vector. Employing the traffic between heterogeneous network elements to describe the non-linear features by reasoning the origin traffic. To make the discrete features into finite feature of the Noetherian ring, furtherly operate Legendre equation to design reversible multidimensional feature matrix. Those enhance the aggregation of protocol features. Continuous feature set and content monitoring of real-time monitoring traffic are designed. Associating spatial information features is enhances the adaptive ability of traffic feature set. The simulations and tests demonstrates that the new method has improve the accuracy of protocol test by 28% and response time by 3.53 s.

Taking the parallel buck converter as an example, first, the master-slave current sharing SM controller of the parallel buck converter is designed. Then, the NCS containing the designed SM controller is uniformly quantized in the continuous domain, and the stability performance of the system is analyzed according to the quantization error. Considering the parallel buck converter's application in the digital control system, the discretization effect of the uniform quantization SMC system is studied using a text zero-order hold (ZOH), and the stability conditions of the discrete quantization system are given. Finally, the system's state trajectories and output performances under different parameters in the continuous domain and discrete domain are analyzed by simulations, and the correctness and reliability of the uniform quantization SMC system designed in this paper are further verified by experiments.						zhang, weiqi/0000-0002-3180-3653; Wang, Yanmin/0000-0003-2081-6923													2169-3536						2023	11						99918	99934		10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3309162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3309162													WOS:001071087000001
J	Backlund, PB; Shahan, DW; Seepersad, CC				Backlund, Peter B.; Shahan, David W.; Seepersad, Carolyn Conner			Classifier-guided sampling for discrete variable, discontinuous design space exploration: Convergence and computational performance	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												A classifier-guided sampling (CGS) method is introduced for solving engineering design optimization problems with discrete and/or continuous variables and continuous and/or discontinuous responses. The method merges concepts from metamodel-guided sampling and population-based optimization algorithms. The CGS method uses a Bayesian network classifier for predicting the performance of new designs based on a set of known observations or training points. Unlike most metamodelling techniques, however, the classifier assigns a categorical class label to a new design, rather than predicting the resulting response in continuous space, and thereby accommodates non-differentiable and discontinuous functions of discrete or categorical variables. The CGS method uses these classifiers to guide a population-based sampling process towards combinations of discrete and/or continuous variable values with a high probability of yielding preferred performance. Accordingly, the CGS method is appropriate for discrete/discontinuous design problems that are ill suited for conventional metamodelling techniques and too computationally expensive to be solved by population-based algorithms alone. The rates of convergence and computational properties of the CGS method are investigated when applied to a set of discrete variable optimization problems. Results show that the CGS method significantly improves the rate of convergence towards known global optima, on average, compared with genetic algorithms.																			0305-215X	1029-0273				MAY 4	2015	47	5					579	600		10.1080/0305215X.2014.908869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0305215X.2014.908869													WOS:000350042100001

This method could find the best possible optimum solutions with high grantees for the synthesis of RN, which generally is kind of mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models. In this work, instead of solving the discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, (like MINLP problems), a combination of stochastic algorithm and mathematical methods (i.e. Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) + quasi LP (QLP)) has been used. The reason for using NSGA II is because of the possibility of considering several objective functions instead of a single function in obtaining RN synthesis solutions. This algorithm could provide several optimal structure of RNs as set of final optimal solutions by use of its operators. The isothermal RNs produced by NSGA II are sent to QLP model to compute the amount of objective functions. In the QLP model, whilst all continues variables of RN calculated with just using a linear and a non-linear equations set with outer search loop, their general objective functions are also calculated. Comparison the results with the references shows that the presented method is capable of producing better solutions, which, in some cases improvement of about one percent in concentration of the main material in the product and a decrease of 77 % of the residence time of the materials in the reactor system is observed.

The trade-offs between the production and the fresh water requirement is captured through the Pareto optimal front. The Pareto optimal front consists of discrete points and facilitates decision maker to select an appropriate operating point based on other process constraints.

The mixed time delays comprise both the multiple discrete time delays and the infinite distributed delays. A sequence of stochastic variables is introduced to govern the random occurrences of the discrete time delays, distributed time delays, and successive packet dropouts, where all the stochastic variables are mutually independent but obey the Bernoulli distribution. The main purpose of this paper is to design a fuzzy fault detection filter such that the overall fault detection dynamics is exponentially stable in the mean square and, at the same time, the error between the residual signal and the fault signal is made as small as possible. Sufficient conditions are first established via intensive stochastic analysis for the existence of the desired fuzzy fault detection filters, and then, the corresponding solvability conditions for the desired filter gains are established. In addition, the optimal performance index for the addressed robust fuzzy fault detection problem is obtained by solving an auxiliary convex optimization problem.

The methodology is based on the superstructure approach for reactor network synthesis and extends our previous work (Zhao and Marquardt, 2016) to simultaneously design the process and the control system structure. The spectral abscissa of the Jacobian matrix of the closed-loop reactor network is chosen to measure the response speed of the designed process. A mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) with complementarity constraints and a robust eigenvalue constraint is formulated and solved sequentially by a two-step solution strategy. Structural alternatives of the process and the control system as well as parametric uncertainties are considered in an integrated framework.

The most commonly observed measure of product availability in practical settings is the fill-rate service level. However, the optimal design of a distribution network that considers the fill rate to control shortages of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) is considered intractable and has only been addressed by heuristic methods. This paper addresses the optimal design of a distribution network for FMCG able to provide high fill-rate service level under a continuous review (r,Q)$(r,Q)$ policy. Considering the exact formulation for the provided fill rate, we formulated a joint location-inventory model with fill-rate service level constraints as a convex mixed integer nonlinear problem for which a novel decomposition-based outer approximation algorithm is proposed. Numerical experiments have shown that our solution approach provides good-quality solutions that are on average 0.15% and, at worst, 2.2% from the optimal solution.

The focus is mainly on the design of useful control laws such that the constructed error system converges to zero in a fixed time. The major difficulty is to cope with the discontinuous neuron activations, D operators, time-varying discrete, and distributed delays simultaneously. To accomplish the target, a new and effective framework is firstly established. By means of functional differential inclusions theory, inequality technique and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, novel discontinuous feedback controllers are designed and some new verifiable algebraic criteria are derived to design the control gains. In contrast to the existed results on the neutral-type neural networks, the theoretical results of this paper are more general and rigorous. Finally, numerical examples and simulations are presented to illustrate the correctness of the main results.

The formulation is based on the resource task network process representation, uses a uniform time grid continuous-time representation, and can handle both short-term and periodic problems. It originates mixed-integer nonlinear programs or mixed-integer linear programs, depending on the types of tasks and objective function being considered. The performance of the formulation is illustrated through the solution of two periodic example problems that have been examined in the literature, where the selection and design of the main equipment, items and their connecting pipes is considered. The results clearly show that all decisions should be part of the same model because the plant structure, operating schedule, and cycle time can all change with a change in product demand.

Stabilization of sampled-data nonlinear systems via backstepping on their Euler approximate model	AUTOMATICA												Two integrator backstepping designs are presented for digitally controlled continuous-time plants in special form. The controller designs are based on the Euler approximate discrete-time model of the plant and the obtained control algorithms are novel. The two control laws yield, respectively, semi global-practical stabilization and global asymptotic stabilization of the Euler model. Both designs achieve semiglobal-practical stabilization (in the sampling period that is regarded as a design parameter) of the closed-loop sampled-data system. A simulation example illustrates that the obtained controllers may sometimes be superior to backstepping controllers based on the continuous-time plant model that are implemented digitally.

It is shown that mathematical representations of this type allow for a broad range of interactions between the discrete and continuous variables in the system. Since the form of these interactions determines the dynamic properties of the network, the number of possible configurations can be significantly expanded in this way. In the context of gene regulation, this added flexibility can be used to formulate models that better reflect the physical nature of the underlying biochemical processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To solve this problem we have recently proposed [1] a theoretical framework based on the Platform Based Design (PBD). The first step consists in mapping control specifications onto communication network specifications: this involves parameters as quantization noise, coding and modulation scheme, and power level. Next, a communication scheme is chosen so that the control specifications are satisfied. Hybrid models are exploited in order to capture the intrinsic discrete-continuous behaviors, and the developed framework is able to account for safety specifications that often occur in industrial control systems. While in our previous work we have been concerned with modeling efforts, in this paper we focus on the development of control methodologies and provide an example of application within a test case that is currently considered within the project HYCON.

Modeling timed concurrent systems	CONCUR 2006 - CONCURRENCY THEORY, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science				17th International Conference on Concurrency Theory	AUG 27-30, 2006	Bonn, GERMANY					Timed concurrent systems are widely used in concurrent and distributed real-time software, modeling of hybrid systems, design of hardware systems (using hardware description languages), discrete-event simulation, and modeling of communication networks. They consist of concurrent components that communicate using timed signals, that is, sets of (semantically) time-stamped events. The denotational semantics of such systems is traditionally formulated in a metric space, wherein causal components are modeled as contracting functions. We show that this formulation excessively restricts the models of time that can be used. In particular, it cannot handle super-dense time, commonly used in hardware description languages and hybrid systems modeling, finite time lines, and time with no origin. Moreover, if we admit continuous-time and mixed signals (essential for hybrid systems modeling) or certain Zeno signals, then causality is no longer equivalent to its formalization in terms of contracting functions. In this paper, we offer an alternative semantic framework using a generalized ultrametric that overcomes these limitations.

In this paper, we benchmark two different approaches to nonlinear topology optimization of District Heating Networks in terms of computational cost and optimality gap. We compare a combinatorial approach, which directly solves a mixed-integer nonlinear program, against a density-based approach. This density-based approach relaxes the integer constraint on pipe placement and ensures near-discrete topologies through penalization. The benchmark shows subquadratic scaling of the computational cost for the density-based approach, making it tractable for large problems, while the combinatorial approach scales exponentially. The combinatorial approach took 29 h to optimize a network for a neighborhood of about 600 streets, compared to 35 min for the density-based method. Optimality gap analysis indicates that resolving the integer constraint on pipe placement does not necessarily lead to a superior design, while making the optimization of large practical problems intractable. In contrast, the scaling of the density-based approach remains tractable for large problems. Further study of the optimality gap highlights the importance of consciously choosing initialization strategies when deciding to solve the nonlinear topology optimization problem.

To address this issue, this article first proposes a discrete memristive Rulkov neuron model (MRN) and then constructs a large-scale discrete memristive Rulkov ring-star neural network model (MRRSNN). Furthermore, spatiotemporal pattern, snapshot, and recurrence plot of the nodes are adopted to declare the spatio-temporal dynamics of the MRRSNN. Consequently, it can manifest rich network behaviors, including double-well chimera, asynchronized, multiclustered, solitary, synchronized, and continuous traveling wave states. Besides, the influence of the memristive coupling strength and initial conditions of MRNs on the network behaviors is quantified by three metrics, including root mean-square deviation, averaged cross-correlation coefficient, and normalized time-averaged synchronization error, which provides an important basis for state regulation of the MRRSNN. Finally, a spatio-temporal chaos-based pseudorandom number generator is designed, and experiment results from the NIST 800-22 and performance indicators show that the MRRSNN generates better random sequences than the MRN even in the presence of dynamic degeneracy.						min, fuhong/0000-0001-7826-3124													1551-3203	1941-0050				2024 MAY 8	2024										10.1109/TII.2024.3393563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TII.2024.3393563		MAY 2024											WOS:001218633400001

In the course of amplifier design, matching networks are constructed employing the real frequency techniques. In order to come with proper production technology, three amplifiers were considered with lumped elements, commensurate transmission lines, and with mixed lumped and distributed elements. It is deduced that lumped element broad X-Band power amplifier can be either built using discrete component technology or utilizing Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuit technology. It turns out to be that mixed element amplifier can easily be built with discrete components which is relatively cheaper solution. Unfortunately, usage of commensurate transmission lines results in impractical characteristic impedance distributions which are not technically feasible to print as microstrip lines.

Design engineers working within the limited scope of construction projects report that only ad-hoc, experience-based methods of capacity analysis are available to them. Designs have subtle capacity pitfalls which are discovered too late, only when network-wide timetables are made - there is a mismatch between the scope of construction projects and the scope of capacity analysis, as currently practiced. We suggest a language for capacity specifications suited for construction projects, expressing properties such as running time, train frequency, overtaking and crossing. Verifying these properties amounts to solving a planning problem constrained by discrete control system logic, network topology, laws of motion, and sparse communication. To describe train dynamics one uses second-order linear differential equations which when solved analytically give rise to non-linear equations over real variables. We argue that reasoning over the whole discrete/continuous solution space is not efficient with current state-of-the-art solvers. Instead, we have solved the problem by building a special-purpose solver which splits the problem into two: an abstracted SAT-based dispatch planning, and continuous-domain dynamics and timing constraints evaluated using discrete event simulation. The two components communicate in a CEGAR-loop (counterexample-guided abstraction refinement). We show that our method is fast enough at relevant scales to provide agile verification in a design setting, and we present case studies based on data from existing infrastructure and ongoing construction projects.

Optimisation of water networks using linear programming	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT												In this study, optimal design of municipal water distribution networks is determined by the mixed-integer real linear programming technique. The method is capable of rapidly obtaining the discrete characteristics of commercially available pipe sizes, pumps and reservoir heights. The hydraulic and optimisation analyses are linked through an iterative procedure which enables a water distribution system to be designed that satisfies all required constraints with a minimum total cost. The constraints include pipe sizes, which are limited to the commercially available sizes, reservoir heights, available pumps, pipe flow velocities and nodal pressures. Unlike integer linear programming, the developed model has the advantages of having short nodal pressure constraint equations and the ability of optimising networks that contain pumps. The proposed model has also been applied to a network solved by others. Comparison of the results indicates that the results of the proposed method are satisfactory.																			1741-7589	1751-7729				OCT	2010	163	9					475	485		10.1680/wama.2010.163.9.475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/wama.2010.163.9.475													WOS:000283907800007

J	Liu, MQ				Liu, Meiqin			Delayed standard neural network models for control systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS												In order to conveniently analyze the stability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and successfully synthesize the controllers for nonlinear systems, similar to the nominal model in linear robust control theory, the novel neural network model, named delayed standard neural network model (DSNNM) is presented, which is the interconnection of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static delayed (or nondelayed) nonlinear operator. By combining a number of different Lyapunov functionals with S-procedure, some useful criteria of global asymptotic stability and global exponential stability for the continuous-time DSNNMs (CDSNNMs) and discrete-time DSNNMs (DDSNNMs) are derived, whose conditions are formulated as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on the stability analysis, some state-feedback control laws for the DSNNM with input and output are designed to stabilize the closed-loop systems. Most RNNs and neurocontrol nonlinear systems with (or without) time delays can be transformed into the DSNNMs; to be stability-analyzed or stabilization-synthesized in a unified way. In this paper, the DSNNMs are applied to analyzing the stability of the continuous-time and discrete-time RNNs with or without time delays, and synthesizing the state-feedback controllers for the chaotic neural-network-system and discrete-time nonlinear system. It turns out that the DSNNM makes the stability conditions of the RNNs easily verified, and provides a new idea for the synthesis of the controllers for the nonlinear systems.																			1045-9227	1941-0093				SEP	2007	18	5					1376	1391		10.1109/TNN.2007.894084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.894084								18220187					WOS:000249279400009

The DDIS model is formulated from a discrete-time delayed system with impulses. By using the matrix spectrum theory, the estimates of solution with growth exponent are derived for delayed difference inequalities. Based on these results, two types of criteria on exponential stability with an estimated convergence rate have been established for DDIS. The first type investigates the effect of destabilising impulses, while the second is for the case in which the impulses stabilise the unstable discrete-time delayed systems. As the application, the stability results are used to solve the multi-tracking issue for discrete-time dynamical networks by mixed impulsive networked control (MINC), in which the impulsive control signals are transmitted via a communication network. The effect of data dropout of impulsive control signals is also investigated and the maximal allowable dropout rate is estimated for the designed MINC. Finally, one example with numerical simulations is worked out for illustration.

Multisite facility network integration design and coordination: An application to the refining industry	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This paper addresses the design and analysis of multisite integration and coordination strategies within a network of petroleum refineries using different crude combination alternatives. In addition, production capacity expansion requirements are also accounted for. The main feature of the paper is the development of a methodology for simultaneous analysis of process network integration alternatives in a multisite refining system through a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) with the overall objective of minimizing total annualized cost. The State Equipment Network (SEN) representation was used for modeling the network as it provides a consistent modeling strategy and proper handling of units that operate under different operating modes. which is common in the refining industry. The integrated network design specifically addresses intermediate material transfer between processing units at each site. The performance of the proposed model was tested on several industrial-scale examples to illustrate the economic potential and trade-offs involved in the optimization of the network. The use of mathematical programming models on ail enterprise-wide scale to address strategic decisions considering various process integration alternatives yielded substantial benefits. These benefits not only materialize in terms of economic considerations. but also in terms of process flexibility and improvements in the understanding of the process interactions and systems limitations. Although the methodology was applied oil a network of refineries, it can be readily extended to cover any network of continuous chemical processes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, clock skew scheduling, which has great impact on criticality of combinational paths in sequential circuit, has not been explored in the merit of MSV assignment. In this paper, we propose a discrete voltage assignment algorithm for sequential circuit under clock scheduling. The sequential MSV assignment problem is first formulated as a convex cost dual network flow problem, which can be optimally solved in polynomial time assuming delay of each gate can be chosen in continuous domain. Then a mincut-based heuristic is designed to convert the unfeasible continuous solution into feasible discrete solution while largely preserving the global optimality. Besides, we revisit the hardness of the general discrete voltage assignment problem and point out some misunderstandings on the approximability of this problem in previous related work. Benchmark test for our algorithm shows 9.2% reduction in power consumption on average, in compared with combinational MSV assignment. Referring to the continuous solution obtained from network flow as the lower bound, the gap between our solution and the lower bound is only 1.77%.

Problems of this type have received considerable attention recently, mostly for discrete variants of the problem. We consider a fully continuous setting, where the problem of computing distances and placing a shortcut is much harder as all points on the network, instead of only the vertices, must be taken into account. We present the first results on the computation of optimal shortcuts for general networks in this model: a polynomial time algorithm and a discretization of the problem that leads to an approximation algorithm. We also improve the general method for networks that are paths, restricted to two types of shortcuts: those with a fixed orientation and simple shortcuts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, a discrete-time adaptive dynamic surface control (DSC) scheme for the quadrotor is proposed to obtain a satisfactory tracking performance. The nonlinearities and couplings are overcome by employing the designed robust adaptive DSC nonlinear control method. The underactuated problem is overcome by solving the designed adaptive neural control equations. Also, different from the continuous-time control scheme, the discrete-time control is more suitable for the computer and network control in practicable cases. Furthermore, the digital first-order low-pass filters are constructed to predict the future virtual control signal in the backstepping method, leading to the avoidance of the model transformation problem in the discrete-time backstepping method.

First, a discrete-time implementation of high-gain observer (HGO) is utilized to obtain state trajectory from sampled output measurements. By taking the recurrent estimated trajectory as inputs to a dynamical radial basis function network (RBFN), a partial persistent exciting (PE) condition is satisfied, and a locally accurate approximation of nonlinear dynamics can be realized along the estimated sampled-data trajectory. Second, an RBFN-based observer consisting of the obtained dynamics from the process of deterministic learning is designed. Without resorting to high gains, the RBFN-based observer is shown capable of achieving correct state observation. The novelty of this article lies in that, by incorporating deterministic learning with the discrete-time HGO, the nonlinear dynamics can be accurately approximated along the estimated trajectory, and such obtained knowledge can then be utilized to realize nonhigh-gain state estimation for the same or similar sampled-data systems. Simulation is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.					姬, 冰/GRS-6888-2022	JI, Bing/0000-0003-1326-4120; Wang, Cong/0000-0001-5485-1650													2162-237X	2162-2388				JUL	2022	33	7					2931	2939		10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3047226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3047226		JAN 2021						33444148					WOS:000732933000001
J	Salis, H; Sotiropoulos, V; Kaznessis, YN				Salis, H; Sotiropoulos, V; Kaznessis, YN			Multiscale Hy3S: Hybrid stochastic simulation for supercomputers	BMC BIOINFORMATICS												Background: Stochastic simulation has become a useful tool to both study natural biological systems and design new synthetic ones. By capturing the intrinsic molecular fluctuations of "small" systems, these simulations produce a more accurate picture of single cell dynamics, including interesting phenomena missed by deterministic methods, such as noise-induced oscillations and transitions between stable states. However, the computational cost of the original stochastic simulation algorithm can be high, motivating the use of hybrid stochastic methods. Hybrid stochastic methods partition the system into multiple subsets and describe each subset as a different representation, such as a jump Markov, Poisson, continuous Markov, or deterministic process. By applying valid approximations and self-consistently merging disparate descriptions, a method can be considerably faster, while retaining accuracy. In this paper, we describe Hy3S, a collection of multiscale simulation programs. Results: Building on our previous work on developing novel hybrid stochastic algorithms, we have created the Hy3S software package to enable scientists and engineers to both study and design extremely large well-mixed biological systems with many thousands of reactions and chemical species. We have added adaptive stochastic numerical integrators to permit the robust simulation of dynamically stiff biological systems. In addition, Hy3S has many useful features, including embarrassingly parallelized simulations with MPI; special discrete events, such as transcriptional and translation elongation and cell division; mid-simulation perturbations in both the number of molecules of species and reaction kinetic parameters; combinatorial variation of both initial conditions and kinetic parameters to enable sensitivity analysis; use of NetCDF optimized binary format to quickly read and write large datasets; and a simple graphical user interface, written in Matlab, to help users create biological systems and analyze data. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of Hy3S with examples, including a large-scale system benchmark and a complex bistable biochemical network with positive feedback. The software itself is open-sourced under the GPL license and is modular, allowing users to modify it for their own purposes. Conclusion: Hy3S is a powerful suite of simulation programs for simulating the stochastic dynamics of networks of biochemical reactions. Its first public version enables computational biologists to more efficiently investigate the dynamics of realistic biological systems.

Thereby, any characteristics of the reaction progress can be identified, e.g. benefits from mixing, back-mixing, recycling, heating, cooling, etc. The approach is used to (i) determine the attainable region for the modified, isothermal van-de-Vusse reaction, which matches literature results; and (ii) synthesize reactor-network candidates for the standard, non-isothermal van-de-Vusse reaction, which gives new insights compared to previous results from literature using superstructure optimization approaches. The results indicate how this approach can be used to determine the attainable region of a process and to rationally select candidates for detailed reactor design with, e.g. superstructure optimization. It further closes the gap between dynamic batch optimization and continuous reactor-network synthesis.

In terms of the broadbandization and the robustness of the networked control systems, this paper considers the continuous-time quantized control. In the quantized control, it is important to design a quantizer that minimizes the output difference between before and after the quantizer implementation. This paper describes a numerical optimization method of a continuous-time quantizer considering the switching speed. Using a matrix uncertainty approach of sampled-data control, we clarify that both of the temporal and spatial resolution constraints can be considered in analysis and synthesis, simultaneously.																					978-3-033-03962-9				2013							4532	4537																WOS:000332509704156

The activation functions are assumed to be globally Lipschitz continuous. A delay-dependent condition for the existence of state estimators is proposed based on new bounding techniques. Via solutions to certain linear matrix inequalities, general full-order state estimators are designed that ensure globally asymptotic stability. The significant feature is that no inequality is needed for seeking upper bounds for the inner product between two vectors, which can reduce the conservatism of the criterion by employing the new bounding techniques.

In the presence of mixed delays, random packet losses and multiplicative noises, sufficient conditions for the existence of an observer-based feedback controller are derived, such that the closed-loop control system is asymptotically mean-square stable and preserves a guaranteed H-infinity performance.

The PTMLCN considered in this paper consists of several mixed-valued logical control networks with periodically switching signals, which circulates among different mixed-valued logical control networks. First, a PTMLCN is transformed into a discrete dynamic system by the semi-tensor product. Based on this algebraic expression, the time-dependent input-state incident matrix and the time-dependent state transition matrix are defined and the relationship between these two matrices is given. Secondly, the controllability and reachability of PTMLCNs are defined. Subsequently, by virtue of the proposed matrices, a series of necessary and sufficient conditions are given for checking controllability and reachability, and the algorithm for finding the optimal control sequence to reach the target state in the shortest time is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by an example.

Sample preparation, which includes dilution of fluids or solution mixing, is needed as a preprocessing step for most of the assays. Although continuous-flow microfluidic biochips (CFMB) are being widely used by chemists and biologists, accurate sample preparation with them is a challenge and the technology lacks an automated CAD-tool that can be deployed to design the underlying fluidic network. In this paper, we present, the physical design of a 3D-fluidic network that can be used as a universal platform for dilution preparation. The network does not need any control-valve for fluid navigation or multiplexing, yet it is fully programmable. A sample with any given concentration factor (CF) can be produced as output-flow by controlling only the rate of input-fluid injection. Simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics Software shows that the proposed free-flowing CFMB outperforms prior approaches in achieving the accuracy of CFs and diversity of applications.

To further reduce the data transmission, both the measured information of system outputs and switching signal of the SNNs are only allowed to be accessible for the constructed estimator at the certain triggering time instants. Under this consideration, the simultaneous presence of the switching and triggering actions also leads to the asynchronism between the indices of the SNNs and the designed estimator. Unlike the existing event-triggered strategies for the general switched linear systems, the proposed event-triggered mechanism not only allows the occurrence of multiple switches in one triggering interval but also removes the minimum dwell-time constraint on the switched signal. In light of the piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional theory, sufficient conditions are developed for the estimation error system to be stochastically finite-time bounded with a finite-time specified H-infinity performance. Finally, the effectiveness and applicability of the theoretical results are verified by a switched Hopfield neural network.

By using a distributed control law, which makes use of the communicated states of other subsystems, closed-loop performance is increased at the expense of communication costs. This raises the question of how to find a topology and associated distributed control law with optimal trade-off between communication costs and closed-loop performance. As an answer to this question, we propose an approach to simultaneous optimization of network topology and control law with respect to a cost function which combines a quadratic performance criterion with costs associated to the presence of communication links. The problem is formulated as mixed-integer semi-definite problem (MISDP) where the discrete optimization of the network topology subject to communication constraints and embedded subproblems for structured controller synthesis lead to an upper bound for the combined cost. An example is used to illustrate the method.

The framework integrates two modelling components: (i) a within-day dynamic assignment model that simulates the interaction between the time-varying network and travel demand, and (ii) a dynamic vehicle routing model that design optimal routes of emergency vehicles. The linking variable of the two modelling components is the short-term forecasted travel time, which allows to design routes of emergency vehicles based on anticipatory knowledge of traffic dynamics on the road network.

Backpropagation for Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computing	ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 28 (NIPS 2015)	Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems				29th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)	DEC 07-12, 2015	Montreal, CANADA					Solving real world problems with embedded neural networks requires both training algorithms that achieve high performance and compatible hardware that runs in real time while remaining energy efficient. For the former, deep learning using backpropagation has recently achieved a string of successes across many domains and datasets. For the latter, neuromorphic chips that run spiking neural networks have recently achieved unprecedented energy efficiency. To bring these two advances together, we must first resolve the incompatibility between backpropagation, which uses continuous-output neurons and synaptic weights, and neuromorphic designs, which employ spiking neurons and discrete synapses. Our approach is to treat spikes and discrete synapses as continuous probabilities, which allows training the network using standard backpropagation. The trained network naturally maps to neuromorphic hardware by sampling the probabilities to create one or more networks, which are merged using ensemble averaging. To demonstrate, we trained a sparsely connected network that runs on the TrueNorth chip using the MNIST dataset. With a high performance network (ensemble of 64), we achieve 99.42% accuracy at 108 mu J per image, and with a high efficiency network (ensemble of 1) we achieve 92.7% accuracy at 0.268 mu J per image.

A new approach to non-fragile state estimation for continuous neural networks with time-delays	NEUROCOMPUTING												In this paper, the non-fragile state estimation problem is investigated for a class of continuous neural networks with time-delays and nonlinear perturbations. The estimator to be designed is of a simple linear structure without requiring the exact information of the activation functions or the time-delays, and is therefore easy to be implemented. Furthermore, the designed estimator gains are allowed to undergo multiplicative parameter variations within a given range and the non-fragility is guaranteed against possible implementation errors. The main purpose of the addressed problem is to design a non-fragile state estimator for the recurrent delayed neural networks such that the dynamics of the estimation error converges to the equilibrium asymptotically irrespective of the admissible parameter variations with the estimator gains. By employing a combination of the Lyapunov functionals and the matrix analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the existence of the desired estimators and the explicit characterization of such estimators are then given via solving a linear matrix inequality. Finally, a simulation example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Part I: model formulation and circuit continuous optimisation	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION												This study presents a novel model and relevant applications for optimal environmental design of distribution networks. The presentation of the concepts is divided into two papers, of which this paper represents Part I. The proposed methodology is based on a trade-off between emission embodied in the circuit and emissions related to operational losses. Hence, the CO2 emission minimisation problem is developed and analysed for a single circuit in terms of continuous optimisation, and is solved in closed form. This leads to establish a continuous optimal environmental capacity for distribution circuits, and allows identification of the key parameters involved in the analysis. Numerical applications for typical low-voltage (LV) cables used in the UK highlight some numerical aspects of the discussed design. Sensitivity analyses are also run in order to test the robustness of the results found, and to estimate how the design characteristics could change in the presence of different generation mixes. The analyses are completed in Part II, illustrating the application of the model to LV radial networks and relevant environmental and economic implications in comparison to alternative design strategies.

Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained by CFD data can be used for fast and accurate prediction of indoor airflow, but current methods have limitations, such as only predicting limited outputs rather than the entire flow field. Furthermore, conventional AI models are not always designed to predict different outputs based on a continuous input range, and instead make predictions for one or a few discrete inputs. This work addresses these gaps using a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) model approach, which is inspired by current state-of-the-art AI for synthetic image generation. We create a new Boundary Condition CGAN (BC-CGAN) model by extending the original CGAN model to generate 2D airflow distribution images based on a continuous input parameter, such as a boundary condition. Additionally, we design a novel feature-driven algorithm to strategically generate training data, with the goal of minimizing the amount of computationally expensive data while ensuring training quality of the AI model. The BC-CGAN model is evaluated for two benchmark airflow cases: an isothermal lid-driven cavity flow and a non-isothermal mixed convection flow with a heated box. We also investigate the performance of the BC-CGAN models when training is stopped based on different levels of validation error criteria. The results show that the trained BC-CGAN model can predict the 2D distribution of velocity and temperature with less than 5% relative error and up to about 75,000 times faster when compared to reference CFD simulations. The proposed feature-driven algorithm shows potential for reducing the amount of data and epochs required to train the AI models while maintaining prediction accuracy, particularly when the flow changes non-linearly with respect to an input.

J	Sun, M; Liu, J				Sun, Min; Liu, Jing			A novel noise-tolerant Zhang neural network for time-varying Lyapunov equation	ADVANCES IN DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS												The Zhang neural network (ZNN) has become a benchmark solver for various time-varying problems solving. In this paper, leveraging a novel design formula, a noise-tolerant continuous-time ZNN (NTCTZNN) model is deliberately developed and analyzed for a time-varying Lyapunov equation, which inherits the exponential convergence rate of the classical CTZNN in a noiseless environment. Theoretical results show that for a time-varying Lyapunov equation with constant noise or time-varying linear noise, the proposed NTCTZNN model is convergent, no matter how large the noise is. For a time-varying Lyapunov equation with quadratic noise, the proposed NTCTZNN model converges to a constant which is reciprocal to the design parameter. These results indicate that the proposed NTCTZNN model has a stronger anti-noise capability than the traditional CTZNN. Beyond that, for potential digital hardware realization, the discrete-time version of the NTCTZNN model (NTDTZNN) is proposed on the basis of the Euler forward difference. Lastly, the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed NTCTZNN and NTDTZNN models are illustrated by some numerical examples.

A continuous approximation model for time definite many-to-many transportation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												Time definite freight transportation carriers provide very reliable scheduled services between origin and destination terminals. They seek to reduce transportation costs through consolidation of shipments at hubs, but are restricted by the high levels of service to provide less circuitous routings. This paper develops a continuous approximation model for time definite transportation from many origins to many destinations. We consider a transportation carrier serving a fixed geographic region in which demand is modeled as a continuous distribution and time definite service levels are imposed by limiting the maximum travel distance via the hub network. Analytical expressions are developed for the optimal number of hubs, hub locations, and transportation costs. Computational results for an analogous discrete demand model are presented to illustrate the behavior observed with the continuous approximation models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, a general complex network model is proposed. Besides the nonlinear couplings, the network model in this paper can possess parametric disturbances, internal time-varying delay, discrete time-varying delay and distributed time-varying delay. Then, according to the robust control strategy, linear matrix inequality and Lyapunov stability theory, several outer synchronization protocols are strictly derived. Simple linear matrix controllers are designed to driver the response network synchronize to the drive network. Additionally, our results can be applied on the complex networks without parametric disturbances. Finally, by utilizing the delayed Lorenz chaotic system as the dynamics of all nodes, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In terms of optimal control, a theoretical comparison of continuous control, traditional event-based control (ETC), and PETC from the perspective of stability convergence, concluding that PETC does not significantly affect the convergence rate than ETC. It is the first time to present PETC for optimal control target of nonlinear systems. A critic network is introduced to approximate the optimal value function based on the idea of reinforcement learning (RL). It is proven that the discrete updating time series from PETC can also be utilized to determine the updating time of the learning network. In this way, the gradient-based weight estimation for continuous systems is developed in discrete form. Then, the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) condition of controlled systems is analyzed to ensure the stability of the designed method. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of the method.

J	Chen, WL; Hu, J; Yu, XY; Chen, DY				Chen, Weilu; Hu, Jun; Yu, Xiaoyang; Chen, Dongyan			Protocol-Based Fault Detection for Discrete Delayed Systems With Missing Measurements: The Uncertain Missing Probability Case	IEEE ACCESS												This paper is concerned with the protocol-based fault detection problem for a class of discrete systems with mixed time delays and missing measurements under uncertain missing probabilities. The phenomenon of missing measurements is characterized by a set of Bernoulli random variables, where each sensor could have individual missing probability and the corresponding occurrence probability could be uncertain. In order to mitigate the communication load of the network and reduce the incidence of the data collisions in the engineering reality, the round-robin (RR) protocol is employed to regulate the data transmission orders. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a fault detection filter such that, in the simultaneous presence of mixed time delays, missing measurements, and RR protocol mechanism, the resulted filtering error system is asymptotically mean-square stable with a satisfactory H-infinity performance. In particular, some sufficient conditions are derived in terms of certain matrix inequalities and the explicit expression of the required filter parameters is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed fault detection scheme.

Secondly, the existence of a sole globally bounded solution and globally exponential stability to the discrete-time networks are addressed based on Banach contractive mapping principle and the constant variation formula for sequences. Besides, exponential synchronization of the discrete-time networks is investigated and a feedback controller is designed from the viewpoint of the theory of controls. It is the first time to consider nonlocal fuzzy delayed competitive neural networks by using Mittag-Leffler Euler differences. In contrast to nonlocal discrete approaches, such difference competitive neural networks could preferably figure the features of continuous networks. The difference method in this paper extends and improves the traditional difference approaches, for example, Adams-Bashforth Euler differences. Moreover, this article explores some avenue for the research of discrete-time fractional-order systems and develops a set of theories and methodologies for the future investigations.					刘, 云涛/GQQ-5223-2022														0954-4062	2041-2983				2024 FEB 16	2024										10.1177/09544062231225513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09544062231225513		FEB 2024											WOS:001163905300001

Stationary oscillation of interval fuzzy cellular neural networks with mixed delays under impulsive perturbations	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS												In this paper, a class of stationary oscillation of interval fuzzy cellular neural networks (FCNNs) with mixed delays under impulsive perturbations are considered. Mixed delays include discrete time-varying delays and unbounded distributed delays. By establishing a simple Lyapunov function, using impulsive differential inequality techniques and LMI techniques, some new sufficient criteria are obtained to ensure the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of stationary oscillation of interval FCNNs. The obtained results can be checked easily by the LMI control toolbox in MATLAB. Moreover, the results obtained in this paper are useful in the application and design of FCNNs, since the sufficient criteria are simple and easy to check in practice.

The objective of this study is to reduce the annual investment and operating costs associated with energy losses and the installation costs of D-STATCOMs. This objective function is based on the classical energy budget and the capacity constraints of the device. In the master stage, MATLAB software is used to program a discrete version of the sine-cosine algorithm (DSCA), which determines the locations where the D-STATCOMs will be installed. In the slave stage, using the BONMIN solver of the GAMS software and the known locations of the D-STATCOMs, the MINLP model representing the problem under study is solved to find the value of the objective function and the nominal power of the D-STATCOMs. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed master-slave optimizer, the 33-node IEEE test system with both radial and meshed topologies is used. With this test system, numerical comparisons were made with the exact solution of the MINLP model, using different solvers in the GAMS software, the genetic-convex strategy, and the discrete-continuous versions of the Chu and Beasley genetic algorithm and the salp swarm optimization algorithm. The numerical results show that DSCA-BONMIN achieves a global solution to the problem under study, making the proposed method an effective tool for decision-making in distribution companies.

The main highlights are threefold: (1) a new event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is presented, which can be regarded as a switching between the discrete-time periodic sampled-data control and a continuous ETM; (2) a saturating controller which is equipped with two switching gains is designed to match the switching property of the proposed ETM; (3) a dedicated switching Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed, which takes the sawtooth constraints of control input into account. Based on these ingredients, the synchronization criteria are derived such that the considered error systems are locally stable. Whereafter, two co-design problems are discussed to maximize the set of admissible initial conditions and the triggering threshold, respectively.

Linear matrix inequality approach for synchronization control of fuzzy cellular neural networks with mixed time delays	CHINESE PHYSICS B												Fuzzy cellular neural networks (FCNNs) are special kinds of cellular neural networks (CNNs). Each cell in an FCNN contains fuzzy operating abilities. The entire network is governed by cellular computing laws. The design of FCNNs is based on fuzzy local rules. In this paper, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach for synchronization control of FCNNs with mixed delays is investigated. Mixed delays include discrete time-varying delays and unbounded distributed delays. A dynamic control scheme is proposed to achieve the synchronization between a drive network and a response network. By constructing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional which contains a triple-integral term and the free-weighting matrices method an improved delay-dependent stability criterion is derived in terms of LMIs. The controller can be easily obtained by solving the derived LMIs. A numerical example and its simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Optimization of water distribution networks using a deterministic approach	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												Water distribution networks (WDNs) are the main component of industrial and urban water distribution systems and are currently formed by pipes, nodes and loops. In this article, a deterministic mathematical programming approach is proposed, aiming to minimize the cost of looped WDNs, considering known pipe lengths and a discrete set of commercially available diameters. The optimization model constraints are mass balances in nodes, energy balances in loops and hydraulic equations, in such a way that no additional software is needed to find the appropriate pressure drops and water velocities. Generalized disjunctive programming is used to reformulate the discrete optimization problem to a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) environment is used to solve the problem. Four cases are studied to test the applicability of the model and the results show compatibility with the literature.					de Carvalho, Esdras Penêdo/AAR-5849-2021; Ravagnani, Mauro A S S/Q-3010-2018; Cassiolato, Gustavo/ABE-3733-2021; Caballero, Jose A/B-7567-2011	de Carvalho, Esdras Penêdo/0000-0002-6801-8245; Ravagnani, Mauro A S S/0000-0002-2151-1534; Caballero, Jose A/0000-0001-6470-2907; Cassiolato, Gustavo/0000-0003-0249-844X													0305-215X	1029-0273				JAN 2	2021	53	1					107	124		10.1080/0305215X.2019.1702980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0305215X.2019.1702980		JAN 2020											WOS:000506503200001

The sensitivity is obtained by solving the adjoint system, which can be derived by continuous or discrete adjoint strategies. In acoustic wave propagation, continuous and discrete adjoint methods have been developed to compute the eigenvalue sensitivity to design parameters and passive devices (Aguilar et al., 2017, [1]). In this short communication, it is shown that the continuous and discrete adjoint characteristic decompositions, and Riemann invariants, are connected by a similarity transformation. The results are shown in the Laplace domain. The adjoint characteristic decomposition is applied to a one-dimensional acoustic resonator, which contains a monopole source of sound. The proposed framework provides the foundation to tackle larger acoustic networks with a discrete adjoint approach, opening up new possibilities for adjoint-based design of problems that can be solved by the method of characteristics.

A design method is founded on the solution of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of network superstructure. The application of optimization to solve basic formulation of network synthesis has been reported in some works. However, this approach applies certain extensions of the standard formulation that allow accounting for several industrial scenarios. In particular, it is possible to apply various performance indices and imposing conditions on continuous variables as well as on network topology. Multiple contaminant case is easily accounted for.

Refer to the non-periodic packet dropout that could be described as a Markov process, the varying sampling rate networked control system could be modeled as a discrete-time Markov jump linear system. A relation between the system's H-2 performance and the Markov chain's transition matrix is established, and an algorithm is proposed to address an optimization problem whose solution yields the transition matrix that optimizes closed loop H-2 performance for fixed average dropout rates. Meanwhile according to the transition matrix, an optimal mixed H-2/H-infinity controller has been designed. Finally, a simulation of a networked flight control system is given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The Arcak-type estimator is designed via introducing additional control terms in the domains of activation functions. Its advantage is that the role of gain coefficients of the activation functions on this issue can be analyzed. A linear matrix inequalities based condition is obtained such that the error system is finite-time stable in the mean square. An example is provided to verify the application of the developed method.																					978-1-5386-3257-4				2017							572	577																WOS:000427352100109

In a particular theoretical model of Bala and Goyal (2000) center-sponsored stars are the only strict Nash networks. In testing this theoretical model, Falk and Kosfeld (2003) do not find experimental evidence that players select the center-sponsored star. Based on a slight modification of Bala and Goyal's model, we design a network formation experiment in which, depending on link costs, periphery-sponsored stars and the empty network are the only strict Nash networks. We observe that almost all groups not only reach a strict Nash network once but also switch the center player in periphery-sponsored stars several times. The main innovation in our experiment is to use a continuous time framework which we believe to be a more realistic setting to study behavior in network formation situations and which makes coordination on stars much easier than simultaneous strategy adaptation in discrete time.

In this paper, we proposed a joint user association and downlink beamforming scheme for green C-RANs to minimize the network power consumption with the limited fronthaul links. We first formulate the design problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), and then transformed the MINLP problem into a mixed integer second-order cone program (MI-SOCP) which is a convex program when the integer variables are fixed. By relaxing the integer variables to continuous ones, an inflation algorithm, which can be finished within polynomial time, was proposed to solve the problem. The simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm compared with the the scheme adopted by LTE-A.																			2334-0983		978-1-5090-1328-9				2016																								WOS:000401963302135

A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to enhance the service quality with a limited power supply in the UAV-enabled multicast network. It can reconfigure the signal propagation environment and improve the received power of ground receivers by adjusting the reflection coefficients. The sum rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly designing the UAV movement, RIS reflection matrix, and beamforming design from the UAV to users. This paper proposes a Beamforming control and Trajectory design algorithm based on a Multi-Pass Deep Q -Network (BT-MP-DQN). In the proposed algorithm, the UAV acts as an agent for periodically observing the state of the UAV multicast network and takes actions to adapt to the dynamic environment. Specifically, the movement of the UAV is discrete action, and the beamforming design is continuous action. The simulation results show that this proposed algorithm can effectively improve the achievable rate and satisfy the minimum rate of multicast group users. The deployment of the RIS is beneficial to network performance enhancement. In addition, the multicast network with UAV also outperforms the conventional multicast channel with a fixed-location transmitter.																			1389-1286	1872-7069				MAY	2023	227								109697	10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109697		MAR 2023											WOS:000972487600001

Community structure is believed to be one of the notable features of complex networks representing real complicated systems. Very often, uncovering community structures in networks can be regarded as an optimization problem, thus, many evolutionary algorithms based approaches have been put forward. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an artificial intelligent algorithm originated from social behavior such as birds flocking and fish schooling. PSO has been proved to be an effective optimization technique. However, PSO was originally designed for continuous optimization which confounds its applications to discrete contexts. In this paper, a novel discrete PSO algorithm is suggested for identifying community structures in signed networks. In the suggested method, particles' status has been redesigned in discrete form so as to make PSO proper for discrete scenarios, and particles' updating rules have been reformulated by making use of the topology of the signed network. Extensive experiments compared with three state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real-world signed networks demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and promising.

Such networks are typically designed and operated by different entities, who aim at maximizing their own payoffs. There exists a game among these entities when designing their own networks. In this paper, we study the game investigating how the rational behaviors of entities impact the system robustness. We first introduce a mathematical model to quantify the interacting payoffs among varying entities. Then we study the Nash equilibrium of the game and compare it with the optimal social welfare. We reveal that the cooperation among different entities can be reached to maximize the social welfare in continuous game only when the average degree of each network is constant. Therefore, the huge gap between Nash equilibrium and optimal social welfare generally exists. The rationality of entities makes the system inherently deficient and even renders it extremely vulnerable in some cases. We analyze our model for two concrete systems with continuous strategy space and discrete strategy space, respectively. Furthermore, we uncover some factors (such as weakening coupled strength of interdependent networks, designing a suitable topology dependence of the system) that help reduce the gap and the system vulnerability.

In each cluster, there exists an agent called a leader who can communicate with other leaders outside of its cluster at some specific discrete instants. Moreover, the continuous-time communication structure in each cluster is represented by a fixed and undirected graph. A robust formation control protocol is proposed to deal with the hybrid communication described above and the constraints on states of agents. It is next shown that the hybrid robust formation control design for clustered multi-agent networks can be indirectly solved through the robust stabilization design of an equivalent system obtained by matrix theory and algebraic graph theory. Then, a robust controller is designed for the initial clustered network system in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a formation design for unmanned aerial vehicles is carried out and simulated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid formation control design method. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The model under consideration is subject to unreliable communication links, which result in some network-induced phenomena such as packet dropouts, sensor nonlinearity and unknownlpartly known mode information. A set of Bernoulli distributed white sequences are introduced to govern these phenomena occurring in a random way. The aim is to design a mixed filter, which ensures that the filtering error system is extended stochastically dissipative. Such a mixed filter has the advantages of both the model independent filter and the asynchronous filter. With the help of Lyapunov-Krasovskii methodology and an improved matrix decoupling approach, sufficient conditions for the existence of such a filter are presented by solving some convex optimization problems. A numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier. Ltd.

In the networked system, the multiple outputs of the plant and the controller are independently transmitted via a single shared or multiple channels based on local event-triggering conditions. Regarding the restrictions of physical devices, in the event-checking procedure, an inactive period of time is allowed after each event of data sending. So the Zeno behaviors in events are effectively avoided. In terms of algebraic properties of statespace models and time delays, we present sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability and guaranteed L-2 gain performance and characterize the robustness of the system in a time-delayed networked scenario with independent event-triggered sending of each output. The event-triggered approach provides the potential benefit of reduced number of requests for sending data via networks. A simulation example is given to verify the proposed methods.

The CNDP determines the optimal additional link capacities taking account of the network user equilibrium (UE) condition. The UE condition is represented by a variational inequality (VI) to allow for the link-based formulation of the CNDP. The VI expression is then reformulated as a set of inequality constraints, which is defined against a set of extreme points of the link-flow feasible region. The paper tackles the lack of global optimality of the CNDP by applying the piecewise linear function to approximate the CNDP and transform it to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The paper then proposes an algorithm using the cutting-constraint approach and a standard solver for solving the MILP. The paper finally tests the proposed formulation and algorithm with a hypothetical network and compares the results with other algorithms found in the literature.

In this paper, based on gene expression timeseries data of human leukaemia cells after exposure to ionising radiation, with ionising radiation as input, a nonlinear continuous time-delay dynamic stochastic mathematical model of a p53-Mdm2 network is established using a continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter algorithm. The accuracy of the established model is then validated. Numerical simulation is used to simulate the dynamic regulation in p53-Mdm2 networks for low, medium, and high ionising radiation doses. The results show that the proposed algorithm is convergent and that the error rate of the model is only 1.19%. In addition, the model can simulate accurately the response of the p53-Mdm2 network to different doses of ionising radiation. The methods proposed in this paper can supply the foundation for research on the dynamics of the p53-Mdm2 gene regulation relationship and play a guiding role in research on the p53-Mdm2 response process after DNA damage under different doses of ionising radiation.

To have analytical insight, the achievable throughputs are analysed using continuous adaptation of the rates and the powers.

Also for practical systems, a new throughput maximised transmission scheme is developed using discrete rate adaptation (adaptive modulation and coding) and continuous transmission power adaptation.

The multi-objective functions are defined in terms of the discrete-type design variables and approximated by artificial neutral network, and the sensitivity analyses of these functions are replaced with the iterative genetic evolution. The multi-objective optimization algorithm introduced in this paper is not only highly CPU-time-efficient but it can also be applicable to other multi-objective optimization problems in which the objective function, the design variables and the constraints are not continuous but discrete. Through the illustrative numerical experiments, the fiber-reinforced tire belt structure is optimally tailored.

Guitar Effects Recognition and Parameter Estimation With Convolutional Neural Networks	JOURNAL OF THE AUDIO ENGINEERING SOCIETY												Despite the popularity of guitar effects there is very little existing research on classification and parameter estimation of specific plugins or effect units from guitar recordings. In this paper, convolutional neural networks were used for classification and parameter estimation for 13 overdrive, distortion, and fuzz guitar effects. A novel dataset of processed electric guitar samples was assembled, with four sub-datasets consisting of monophonic or polyphonic samples and discrete or continuous settings values, for a total of about 250 hours of processed samples. Results were compared for networks trained and tested on the same or a different subdataset. We found that discrete datasets could lead to equally high performance as continuous ones while being easier to design, analyze, and modify. Classification accuracy was above 80%, with confusion matrices reflecting similarities in the effects timbre and circuits design. With parameter values between 0.0 and 1.0, the mean absolute error is in most cases below 0.05, while the root mean square error is below 0.1 in all cases but one.

They are the number of different network states, the initial distribution of the network states, the state transition matrix of the hidden Markov chain formed by the network states, the number of different delay observations in the discrete HMM (DHMM) or the number of the Gaussian densities in the semi-continuous HMM (SCHMM), and the delay observation matrix in the DHMM or the combination of the mixture Gaussian distributions in the SCHMM. How to initialize these parameters is very crucial to the precision of the modeling and prediction of random delays. In this paper, the entropy and cluster based initialization methods are proposed to obtain the optimal initialization of these parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by some simulation examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The objective is to minimize deviations from target chlorine concentrations. The problem formulation includes discretized linear PDEs modeling advective transport of chlorine concentrations. Moreover, binary variables model the placement of chlorine boosters. The resulting optimization problem is a convex mixed integer program (MIP), which is difficult to solve, especially when large water networks are considered. We develop a new swapping heuristic to optimally place and control chlorine boosters in water networks. The proposed method relies on a continuous relaxation of the original MIP. We evaluate the heuristic using two case studies, including one large operational water network from the UK.

We attempt to remove this distinction by training neural network autoencoders that embed discrete candidate solutions in continuous latent spaces. This allows us to take advantage of state-of-the-art continuous optimization methods for solving discrete optimization problems, and mitigates certain challenges in discrete optimization, such as design of bias-free search operators. In the experimental part, we consider program synthesis as the special case of combinatorial optimization. We train an autoencoder network on a large sample of programs in a problem-agnostic, unsupervised manner, and then use it with an evolutionary continuous optimization algorithm (CMA-ES) to map the points from the latent space to programs. We propose also a variant in which semantically similar programs are more likely to have similar embeddings. Assessment on a range of benchmarks in two domains indicates the viability of this approach and the usefulness of involving program semantics.

Firstly, in terms of Lyapunov stability theory and inequality technique, simple synchronization conditions are obtained by designing some feedback controllers. Secondly, the activation functions adopted in CNNs are Gaussian-wavelet-type activation functions for the first time, which have great preponderance in network optimization and storage capacity. Furthermore, the settling time with upper bound of the system to achieve fixed-time synchronization can be explicitly evaluated, which is irrelevant to the initial value of the system. Finally, the theoretical results which we derived are attested to be indeed feasible in terms of two numerical simulations.																			1598-5865	1865-2085				OCT	2020	64	1-2					103	118		10.1007/s12190-020-01346-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12190-020-01346-3		APR 2020											WOS:000527454100002

The low-latency fronthaul data transmission from the central processor to small-cell base stations (SBSs) is a key requirement in C-RANs for which conventional wired fronthaul links will be cost-prohibitive and also inconvenient. Therefore, scalable and low-cost wireless fronthaul solutions have drawn much attention in both industry and academia. In this paper, we propose adopting the multicast beamforming strategy over fronthaul links to deliver each user's message to a cluster of SBSs selected according to the user-centric clustering scheme, which then adopts the joint beamforming technique to cooperatively transmit the signal to the target users. Some approximate techniques are applied to obtain a tractable formulation for this mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and an iterative algorithm based on the block coordinate update method is proposed accordingly. Then, a binary search based algorithm is developed to preserve the sparsity of beamformers due to the relaxation of the discrete clustering function with the continuous exponential function. Extensive simulation results are provided to show the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence, power consumption, and weighted sum rate.

A group of agents are considered playing a continuous-kernel noncooperative game over a network. The agents need to seek the Nash equilibrium when each player cannot get the overall action profiles in real time, rather are only able to get information from its networked neighbors. Meanwhile, a continuous-time dynamics is discussed for the players to update their variables, but the communications over the network are only assumed to allow at discrete-time instants, since continuous-time communications are prohibitive and cumbersome in practice. First, the periodic communication is considered at a fixed interval, and the solvability of Nash equilibrium seeking is shown with discrete communications. Then, an event-trigger communication scheme is proposed to further reduce the communication rounds. Nevertheless, the event-trigger communication scheme requires each player continuously monitoring its local states. To alleviate the monitoring burden, a periodic event detection mechanism is further developed. The exponential convergence of the dynamics with the three discrete communication schemes is proven. Finally, the comparative simulation studies are designed to illustrate the algorithm performance with different communication schemes and parameter settings.					yuan, lin/JDW-7387-2023	Yi, Peng/0000-0002-2494-1505; Tang, Yutao/0000-0002-2708-262X													2162-237X	2162-2388				MAR	2024	35	3					4347	4353		10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3201133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3201133		SEP 2022						36070272					WOS:000852221700001

Joint Power and Bandwidth Allocation for Discrete-Rate Multi-User Link Adaptation with Imperfect Channel State Information	2012 IEEE 23RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERSONAL INDOOR AND MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS (PIMRC)					IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	SEP 09-12, 2012	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	IEEE				In practical wireless networks, the available transmission power and bandwidth are limited resources. Therefore, joint bandwidth and power allocation for wireless multi-user networks is essential in order to improve the network performance. Most of the research has focused on continuous rate, power, and bandwidth allocations in the presence of perfect channel knowledge. However, this is not the case with practical systems. In this paper, we therefore consider the issue of discrete power and bandwidth allocation for discrete-rate multi-user link adaptation with imperfect channel state information. To be more specific, we discuss how the system can be designed in such a scenario for i) sum rate maximization and ii) average power minimization in a multi-user setting. The results show that with only a few codes, we can approach the performance of systems that employ continuous (infinite) rates. We have also found that imperfect channel information at the base station affects the performance such that the sum rate is decreased and the average power consumption is increased.																					978-1-4673-2569-1				2012							204	209																WOS:000312809400035

Built on the concept of efficient points, we formulate the problems as mixed-integer programs by using binary variables to determine an optimal risk tolerance for each chance constraint. We develop two benchmark approaches, both of which solve chance-constrained programs with fixed risk values in a bisection algorithm or by enumeration. We specify our approaches for a minimum cost flow problem and a network capacity design problem, both of which involve chance constraints for bounding the risk of demand shortages. We test instances with diverse size and complexity of the two network problems, and demonstrate the computational efficacy as well as give managerial insights. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator packet losses are modelled as two different mutually independent Bernoulli distributed white sequences with known conditional probability distributions. By utilising an observer-based fault detection filter (FDF) as a residual generator, the FD for networked non-linear systems with mixed delays and packet losses is formulated as an H-infinity model-matching problem. Attention is focused on designing the FDF in the closed-loop system setup such that the estimation error between the residuals and filtered faults is made as small as possible and at the same time the closed-loop networked non-linear system is exponentially stable in the mean-square sense. To show the superiority and effectiveness of this work, two numerical examples are presented.

Generally, input and output data of a system (or a function) are measured and recorded. Then, experimenters wish to design a neural network to map exactly these output values. By formulating this as a continuous approximation problem, this paper shows that the use of orthogonal functions is a partial optimization in the choice of hidden functions. Parameter's initialization is obtained by using the knowledge of input and output data in the calculation of a discrete approximation. The hidden weights are found by constructing orthogonal directions on which the input values are represented. The pseudo-inverse is used to determine output weights such that the Euclidean distances between neural responses and output values are minimised.					francois, bruno/GLV-0692-2022	francois, bruno/0000-0002-9717-5004													0378-4754					JUN	1996	41	1-2					95	108		10.1016/0378-4754(95)00062-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-4754(95)00062-3													WOS:A1996UU01800010

Evolutionary game theory is a widely-used tool for analyzing player behavior in networks, where players typically adopt binary strategies, either cooperation or defection. However, player behavior in real-world scenarios is often multidimensional and complex, and thus a dynamic model of continuous action iterated dilemma (CAID) with continuous strategy is proposed to enrich the strategies of players, allowing them to choose intermediate states between cooperation and defection, providing a more accurate representation of the evolution of cooperation than traditional dynamic models. Meanwhile, the convergence of traditional models is often analyzed using Jacobian matrices, which requires a significant amount of derivation related to the complex network structure, leading to inefficiencies. As such, a new convergence analysis method based on the Lyapunov function has been designed to circumvent these complex calculations. Additionally, as there is often noise present during the transfer of information between players, we further analyze the convergence of dynamic models in information loss networks using the Lyapunov function. Two examples based on the prisoner's dilemma and snowdrift dilemma on networks are proposed to show the effectiveness of the designed convergence analysis.

By designing simple but effective controllers, constructing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional candidates, and using inequality techniques, some new criteria are obtained to ensure finite-time synchronization of the addressed coupled CGNNs. Moreover, the upper bounds of the finite-time synchronization, i.e., settling time, for the considered networks are estimated. In addition, the effects of known or unknown time delays are seriously considered, respectively, which lead to different design of state feedback controllers. Finally, two examples are presented to show the advantage and effectiveness of our proposed finite-time controllers.

J	Wu, CQ; Wang, L				Wu, Chase Q.; Wang, Li			On Efficient Deployment of Wireless Sensors for Coverage and Connectivity in Constrained 3D Space	SENSORS												Sensor networks have been used in a rapidly increasing number of applications in many fields. This work generalizes a sensor deployment problem to place a minimum set of wireless sensors at candidate locations in constrained 3D space to k-cover a given set of target objects. By exhausting the combinations of discreteness/continuousness constraints on either sensor locations or target objects, we formulate four classes of sensor deployment problems in 3D space: deploy sensors at Discrete/Continuous Locations (D/CL) to cover Discrete/Continuous Targets (D/CT). We begin with the design of an approximate algorithm for DLDT and then reduce DLCT, CLDT, and CLCT to DLDT by discretizing continuous sensor locations or target objects into a set of divisions without sacrificing sensing precision. Furthermore, we consider a connected version of each problem where the deployed sensors must form a connected network, and design an approximation algorithm to minimize the number of deployed sensors with connectivity guarantee. For performance comparison, we design and implement an optimal solution and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed deployment algorithms consistently outperform the GA-based heuristic and achieve a close-to-optimal performance in small-scale problem instances and a significantly superior overall performance than the theoretical upper bound.

The plant system is nonlinear and continuous-time. A discrete nonlinear controller has been designed without the knowledge of the communication network. The integration of the control system under the assumption of time-triggered actuator signal communication requires the choice of a feasible communication policy. It is shown that a continuous-time quadratic infinite horizon cost can be evaluated for the NCS via a sum-of-squares (SOS) approach. The equivalent linear cost computation for the linearized closed-loop is used to minimize computational effort by reducing the number of variables for the cost computation and avoiding SOS-computations where possible.

Finite-Time State Estimation for Recurrent Delayed Neural Networks With Component-Based Event-Triggering Protocol	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												This paper deals with the event-based finite-time state estimation problem for a class of discrete-time stochastic neural networks with mixed discrete and distributed time delays. In order to mitigate the burden of data communication, a general component-based event-triggered transmission mechanism is proposed to determine whether the measurement output should be released to the estimator at certain time-point according to a specific triggering condition. A new concept of finite-time boundedness in the mean square is put forward to quantify the estimation performance by introducing a settling-like time function. The objective of the addressed problem is to construct an event-based state estimator to estimate the neuron states such that, in the presence of both mixed time delays and external noise disturbances, the dynamics of the estimation error is finite-time bounded in the mean square with a prescribed error upper bound. Sufficient conditions are established, via stochastic analysis techniques, to guarantee the desired estimation performance. By solving an optimization problem with some inequality constraints, the explicit expression of the estimator gain matrix is characterized to minimize the settling-like time. Finally, a numerical simulation example is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator design scheme.

J	Luteberget, B; Claessen, K; Johansen, C; Steffen, M				Luteberget, Bjornar; Claessen, Koen; Johansen, Christian; Steffen, Martin			SAT modulo discrete event simulation applied to railway design capacity analysis	FORMAL METHODS IN SYSTEM DESIGN												This paper proposes a new method of combining SAT with discrete event simulation. This new integration proved useful for designing a solver for capacity analysis in early phase railway construction design. Railway capacity is complex to define and analyze, and existing tools and methods used in practice require comprehensive models of the railway network and its timetables. Design engineers working within the limited scope of construction projects report that only ad-hoc, experience-based methods of capacity analysis are available to them. Designs often have subtle capacity pitfalls which are discovered too late, only when network-wide timetables are made-there is a mismatch between the scope of construction projects and the scope of capacity analysis, as currently practiced. We suggest a language for capacity specifications suited for construction projects, expressing properties such as running time, train frequency, overtaking and crossing. Such specifications can be used as contracts in the interface between construction projects and network-wide capacity analysis. We show how these properties can be verified fully automatically by building a special-purpose solver which splits the problem into two: an abstracted SAT-based dispatch planning, and a continuous-domain dynamics with timing constraints evaluated using discrete event simulation. The two components communicate in a CEGAR loop (counterexample-guided abstraction refinement). This architecture is beneficial because it clearly distinguishes the combinatorial choices on the one hand from continuous calculations on the other, so that the simulation can be extended by relevant details as needed. We describe how loops in the infrastructure can be handled to eliminate repeating dispatch plans, and use case studies based on data from existing infrastructure and ongoing construction projects to show that our method is fast enough at relevant scales to provide agile verification in a design setting. Similar SAT modulo discrete event simulation combinations could also be useful elsewhere where one or both of these methods are already applicable such as in bioinformatics or hardware/software verification.

J	Zhang, HZ; Gao, ZY				Zhang, Haozhi; Gao, Ziyou			Bilevel programming model and solution method for mixed transportation network design problem	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE & COMPLEXITY												By handling the travel cost function artfully, the authors formulate the transportation mixed network design problem (MNDP) as a mixed-integer, nonlinear bilevel programming problem, in which the lower-level problem, comparing with that of conventional bilevel DNDP models, is not a side constrained user equilibrium assignment problem, but a standard user equilibrium assignment problem. Then, the bilevel programming model for MNDP is reformulated as a continuous version of bilevel programming problem by the continuation method. By virtue of the optimal-value function, the lower-level assignment problem can be expressed as a nonlinear equality constraint. Therefore, the bilevel programming model for MNDP can be transformed into an equivalent single-level optimization problem. By exploring the inherent nature of the MNDP, the optimal-value function for the lower-level equilibrium assignment problem is proved to be continuously differentiable and its functional value and gradient can be obtained efficiently. Thus, a continuously differentiable but still nonconvex optimization formulation of the MNDP is created, and then a locally convergent algorithm is proposed by applying penalty function method. The inner loop of solving the subproblem is mainly to implement an all-or-nothing assignment. Finally, a small-scale transportation network and a large-scale network are presented to verify the proposed model and algorithm.																			1009-6124	1559-7067				JUN	2009	22	3					446	459		10.1007/s11424-009-9177-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11424-009-9177-3													WOS:000269012500009

Due to the intertwined interaction between nonlinear continuous-time robot/vehicle dynamics and (possibly) aperiodic discrete-time communication characteristics, a unified design of communication and control for heading alignment is extremely challenging. Existing approaches addressing decentralized heading alignment usually first perform analysis and design in the continuous-time domain and then conduct discretization-based implementation to deal with discontinuous information exchange that only happen at discrete-time instants. This two-stage strategy cannot guarantee the original designed control performance in final implementation since discretization can harm or even destabilize the heading controller designed in the continuous-time domain. Inspired by pulse based interaction in flashing fireflies and firing neurons, we propose a unified communication and control approach for collective heading alignment which addresses communication and control simultaneously and hence can retain design performance in final implementation. This approach only exchanges extremely simple and identical messages, which not only reduces processing complexity, transmission time and communication latency, but also implicitly ensures high scalability and robustness to interference in wireless communication. Experimental results on an actual swarm robotics platform are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach.																			1948-9439		978-1-4673-9714-8				2016							2548	2553																WOS:000383222302148
J	Mlika, Z; Cherkaoui, S				Mlika, Zoubeir; Cherkaoui, Soumaya			Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient to Minimize the Age of Information in Cellular V2X Communications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS												This paper studies the problem of minimizing the age of information (AoI) in cellular vehicle-to-everything communications. To provide minimal AoI and high reliability for vehicles' safety information, non-orthogonal multiple access is exploited. We reformulate a resource allocation problem that involves half-duplex transceiver selection, broadcast coverage optimization, power allocation, and resource block (RB) scheduling. First, to obtain the optimal solution, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and then study its NP-hardness. The negative result of NP-hardness motivates us to design efficient sub-optimal solutions. Consequently, we model the problem as a single-agent Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP model helps in solving the problem efficiently using fingerprint deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques such as deep-Q-network (DQN) methods. Nevertheless, applying DQN is not straightforward due to the curse of dimensionality implied by the large and mixed action space that contains discrete RB scheduling decisions and continuous power and coverage optimization decisions. Therefore, to solve this mixed discrete/continuous problem efficiently simply and elegantly, we propose a decomposition technique that consists of first solving the discrete subproblem using a matching algorithm based on state-of-the-art stable roommate matching and then solving the continuous subproblem using DRL algorithm that is based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). We validate our proposed method through Monte Carlo simulations where we show that the decomposed matching and DRL algorithm successfully minimizes the AoI and achieves almost 66% performance gain compared to the best benchmarks for various vehicles' speeds, transmission power, or packet sizes. Further, we prove the existence of an optimal value of broadcast coverage at which the learning algorithm provides the optimal AoI.

Robust Synchronization of Interconnected Linear Systems over Intermittent Communication Networks	2016 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)	Proceedings of the American Control Conference				American Control Conference (ACC)	JUL 06-08, 2016	Boston, MA	Amer Automat Control Council				The property of synchronization of multiple linear time-invariant systems connected over a network with stochastically-driven isolated communication events is studied. We propose a solution to the problem of designing a feedback controller that, using information obtained over such networks, asymptotically drives the values of their states to synchronization and renders such a condition Lyapunov stable. To solve this problem, we propose a controller with hybrid dynamics, namely, the controller exhibits continuous dynamics between communication events and, at such events, has variables that jump. Due to the additional continuous and discrete dynamics inherent to the networked systems and communication structure, we use a hybrid systems framework to model the closed-loop system and design the controller. The problem of synchronization is then recast as a compact set stabilization problem and, by employing Lyapunov stability tools for hybrid systems, sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of the synchronization set are provided. Furthermore, we show that the synchronization property is robust to a class of perturbations on the transmitted data. Numerical examples illustrating the main results are included.

By considering a proper sliding surface and constructing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, as well as employing a combination of the free-weighting matrix method, Newton-Leibniz formulation and inequality technique, a sliding mode controller is designed to achieve the asymptotical synchronization of the addressed nonidentical neural networks. Moreover, a sliding mode control law is also synthesized to guarantee the reachability of the specified sliding surface. The provided conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, and are dependent on the discrete and distributed time delays as well as leakage delay.

This article studies an integrated facility location and inventory allocation problem for designing a distribution network with multiple distribution centers and retailers. The key decisions are where to locate the regional distribution centers (RDCs), how to assign retail stores to RDCs and what should be the inventory policy at the different locations such that the total network cost is minimized. Due to the complexity of the problem, a continuous approximation (CA) model is used to represent the network. Nonlinear programming techniques are developed to solve the optimization problems. The main contribution of this work lies in developing a new CA modeling technique when the discrete data cannot be modeled by a continuous function and applying this technique to solve an integrated facility location-allocation and inventory-management problem. Our methodology is illustrated with the network from a leading US retailer. Numerical analysis suggests that the total cost is significantly lower in the case of the integrated model as compared with the non-integrated model, where the location-allocation and inventory-management problems are considered separately. This paper also studies the effects of changing parameter values on the optimal solutions and to point out some management implications. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the first part of the paper, we propose a continuous-time localization algorithm, which consists of coupled orientation and position estimation procedures.

Considering the obstacles existing within the location area and in order to enhance the planned design quality of pipe network, the obstacle location-allocation optimization model for the looped gathering and transportation pipe network is established, wherein the minimum investment is taken as the objective function. This model belongs to a secondary hybrid-planning problem, which contains a lot of discrete variables and continuous variables. Based on the structural features of this problem, optimization problem is divided into the location layer and allocation layer, and genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm and hierarchical optimization method are systematically combined to work out the solution. By adopting real-coded chromosome, uniform arithmetic crossover and non-uniform mutation, the restoration strategy of chromosome, the optimum maintaining strategy and copy strategy based on the Metropolis criterion are implemented to effectively improve the optimum performance of algorithm. This method is used to conduct the optimum design for the oil/gas gathering and transportation pipe network of certain oilfield tract and the investment on pipeline is reduced by 10.80% compared with the artificial design.																					978-1-84626-021-6				2009							70	78																WOS:000280687000012

The norm-bounded uncertainties are considered in communication neural networks. For the considered neural networks with uncertainties, a reduced-order H-infinity state estimator is designed, which makes that the error dynamics is exponentially stable and has weighted H infinity performance index by Lyapunov function method. Moreover, it is also given the devised method of the reduced-order H-infinity state estimator. Then, considering that sampling the output y(t) of the neural network at every moment will result in waste of excess resources, the event-triggered sampling strategy is used to solve the oversampling problem. In addition, a devised method is also given for the event-triggered reduced-order H-infinity state estimator. Finally, by the well-known Tunnel Diode Circuit example, it shows that a lower order state estimator can be designed under the premise of maintaining the same weighted H-infinity performance index, and using the event-triggered sampling method can reduce the computational and time costs and save communication resources.																			2045-2322					JAN 22	2024	14	1							1852	10.1038/s41598-024-52209-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-52209-x								38253593					WOS:001148428500049
J	Yang, Y; Jiang, XG; Fan, WB; Yan, YS; Xia, L				Yang, Yi; Jiang, Xinguo; Fan, Wenbo; Yan, Yusong; Xia, Liang			Schedule Coordination Design in a Trunk-Feeder Transit Corridor With Spatially Heterogeneous Demand	IEEE ACCESS												As a widely present form of bimodal transit systems, the trunk-feeder transit corridor has received less attention in the academic research compared to the conventional single-modal systems, partly due to the difficulty in the two-dimensional modeling. The schedule coordination of this corridor has been largely ignored, which can potentially strengthen the mutually reinforcing relationship between the trunk transit (e.g., rail) and the feeder transit (e.g., bus). In light of this, the paper proposes a novel two-stage programming model with the objective of minimizing the total cost to design a coordinated trunk-feeder corridor. In stage one, the continuous approximation approach and the discrete method are incorporated to obtain an optimized uncoordinated scheme and a feasible layout. The screened layout parameters such as the specific station location, feeder line location, length of the feeder line segments parallel to the trunk line, and the passenger flow distribution, are recruited into the coordination design in stage two. A nested two-phase optimization algorithm integrated with the analytic method and adaptive genetic algorithm is proposed to find the solutions to the mixed integer nonlinear program issue. Results show that the proposed method is suitable for heterogeneous schedule coordination design and the coordination strategy is more preferable at a lower-level heterogeneous demand. Meanwhile, different from the conventional approaches, this method can generate a rational cost-saving coordination scheme with a feasible layout under the two-dimensional heterogeneous demand pattern.																			2169-3536						2020	8						96391	96403		10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2996084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2996084													WOS:000541139500102

ANTS encodes the neural structure search space within a highly interconnected structure. Optimization agents, like ants, navigate this structure in search of an optimal neural topology. Continuous Ant -based Topology Search (CANTS) builds upon ANTS by replacing the discrete search space with a 3D continuous one.

Firstly, the reason why the adaptive fault diagnosis observer cannot be applied to networked control systems is analyzed. Based on this analysis, a novel robust fault estimation observer is constructed to estimate both continuous-time fault and system states by using nonuniformly discrete-time sampled outputs. Furthermore, using the obtained states and fault information, a nonuniformly sampled-data fault tolerant control law is designed to preserve the stability of the closed-loop system. The proposed scheme can not only guarantee the impact of continuous-time uncertainties and discrete-time sampled estimation errors on the faulty system to satisfy a H performance index but also repress the negative effect of the unknown intersample behavior of continuous-time fault by use of an inequality technique. Finally, simulation results are included to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

When the unit reserve supply is low, the transmission network adjusts the voltage of grid-connected nodes to provide additional resources. Many reactive power devices with different regulatory performance levels and timescales must be coordinated to employ flexible VDLs to the maximum extent, and consequently, a transient stability-constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) problem with mixed integers and multiperiod coupling must be solved. A multitimescale scheduling 'day-ahead-intraday-real-time' framework is designed for the optimal economic scheduling of VDLs. In the day-ahead stage, the optimal scheduling period of the discrete reactive power control devices is determined. In the intraday stage, a rolling optimization model based on model predictive control is established, and the specific action times of the discrete reactive power devices are determined. In the real-time stage, the optimal regulation strategy of the continuous reactive power control device is optimized by rolling. Then, to consider the speed and accuracy of the solution at the same time, a continuous sensitivity correction method is adopted to simplify and solve the original model. Finally, with a modified IEEE-39 system and a modified IEEE-118 system as examples, it is verified that the multitimescale scheduling framework maximizes the exploitation of the flexible resources of VDLs to ensure voltage security and stability and improve the economy of system operation under different scenarios. A large number of reactive power devices with different regulatory performance levels and timescales must be coordinated to employ flexible voltage-dependent loads (VDLs) to the maximum extent, and a transient stability-constrained optimal power flow problem with mixed integers and multiperiod coupling must be solved. A multitime scale scheduling 'Day-ahead-Intraday-Real-time' framework is designed for the optimal economic scheduling of VDLs. image						Fang, Sidun/0000-0002-8024-2688													1752-1416	1752-1424				JUN	2024	18	8					1482	1499		10.1049/rpg2.12988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/rpg2.12988		MAR 2024											WOS:001193287300001

Compared with the research work done previously by others, this paper analyzes continuous-time and discrete-time ZNN models theoretically via rigorous proof. Theoretical results show that the residual errors of the continuous-time ZNN model possesses a global exponential convergence property and that the maximal steady-state residual errors of any method designed intrinsically for solving the static optimization problem and employed for the online solution of OTVNO is O(T), where T denotes the sampling gap. In the presence of noises, the residual errors of the continuous-time ZNN model can be arbitrarily small for constant noises and random noises.

In contrast to most of the existing NOMA designs using continuous Gaussian input distributions, we consider practical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations at both transmitters, the sizes of which are assumed to be not necessarily identical. We propose maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of the received sum constellation with a maximum likelihood (ML) detector by adjusting the scaling factors (i.e., instantaneous transmitted powers and phases) of both users. The formulated problem is a mixed continuous-discrete optimization problem, which is nontrivial to resolve in general. By carefully observing the structure of the objective function, we define a new type of Farey sequence, termed punched Farey sequence to tackle the formulated problem. Based on this, we manage to achieve a closed-form optimal solution to the original problem by first dividing the entire feasible region into a finite number of Farey intervals and then taking the maximum over all possible intervals. The resulting sum constellation is proved to be a regular QAM constellation of a larger size, and hence, a simple quantization receiver can be implemented as the ML detector for the demodulation. Moreover, the superiority of NOMA over time-division multiple access in terms of minimum Euclidean distance is rigorously proved. We subsequently address how to extend our design framework intended for the two-user MAC to systems with multiple users and multiple antennas. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the merits of the proposed NOMA over existing orthogonal and non-orthogonal designs.

By constructing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional candidates and using inequality techniques, some new sufficient conditions are derived to design the discontinuous state feedback controllers such that the addressed neural networks can be synchronized in a finite settling time, where the upper bounds of the settling time of synchronization are estimated. The effects of unknown or known time-delay are seriously taken into account, respectively, which lead to two different delay-independent discontinuous state feedback controllers. Thus our results can be applied to the finite-time synchronization of neural networks whether the time delay can be measured or not. As some special cases, our results also improve some recent works.

J	Das, S; Olurotimi, O				Das, S; Olurotimi, O			Noisy recurrent neural networks: The continuous-time case	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS												The classical stochastic analog of the deterministic linear system in engineering is the linear system driven by white noise. This model is the basis of many important engineering methodologies in stochastic control, system identification, and signal estimation, and classification. As the promise of artificial neural networks in modeling nonlinear systems continues to grow, the need for a stochastic analog with quantitative foundations for analysis and synthesis will increase. This paper (along with a companion paper) represent recent work in this direction, examining recurrent neural networks: (RNN's) driven by white noise. In this paper, we examine the effect of noise on the typical continuous-time RNN model, First, we perform qualitative analysis establishing uniform boundedness of moments of the neuron states over time. To enable practical application in RNN design and evaluation, however, it is necessary to relate these properties to useful measures that can be estimated. We thus subsequently derive bias and variance measures for the noisy RNN with respect to the corresponding deterministic RNN, This has significant practical implications, since neural-network design is nonminimal in the sense that several different networks can be constructed to solve the same problem. The results in this paper allow the user to quantitatively evaluate given RNN's for noise performance, In addition, the designer call use these results to constrain the design space so that the achieved design satisfies performance specifications whenever possible. An example is provided using the measures derived in this paper to predetermine the best among several RNN designs for a given problem. The companion paper presents results for the discrete-time (so-called time-lagged recurrent) case.																			1045-9227	1941-0093				SEP	1998	9	5					913	936		10.1109/72.712164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/72.712164								18255776					WOS:000075719800016

Marshal			Synchronization and state estimation for stochastic complex networks with uncertain inner coupling	NEUROCOMPUTING												This paper addresses the synchronization and state estimation problems for an array of coupled discrete time stochastic complex networks (SCNs) with uncertain inner couplings in which time-varying delay is considered both in the network couplings and dynamical nodes. In particular, the uncertainties encountering in coupling terms are characterized by using the interval matrix approach. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and utilizing Kronecker product properties, a new set of sufficient conditions is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the synchronization of the addressed SCNs with a prescribed mixed Ho and passivity performance index. Moreover, the state estimation problem is then studied for the same SCNs with uncertain inner coupling strength and subsequently, the estimator is designed. More precisely, Schur complement, discrete-time Jensen's inequality together With reciprocally convex combination approach are used to simplify the derivations in the main results. Finally, numerical examples are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization and state estimation results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such systems arise e.g. in networked embedded control applications where limited computation and communication resources have to be scheduled. A periodically time-varying discrete-time plant model and cost function regarding the timing effects are derived for the observer design. The design problem is formulated as a periodic linear quadratic (LQ) optimization problem. By applying the lifting procedure, this periodically time-varying LQ problem is transformed into a standard time-invariant LQ problem. The observer gain then follows from solving a periodic algebraic Riccati equation. Both a prediction and a current state observer are derived. Moreover, the separation principle for periodic systems is proved and observability is analyzed. The periodic observer design is illustrated for a benchmark system.

Exponential stabilization of non-autonomous delayed neural networks via Riccati equations	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION												This paper concerns with the problem of exponential stabilization for a class of non-autonomous neural networks with mixed discrete and distributed time-varying delays. Two cases of discrete time-varying delay, namely (i) slowly time-varying; and (ii) fast time-varying, are considered. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional in case (i) and utilizing the Razumikhin technique in case (ii), we establish some new delay-dependent conditions for designing a memoryless state feedback controller which stabilizes the system with an exponential convergence of the resulting closed-loop system. The proposed conditions are derived through solutions of some types of Riccati differential equations. Applications to control a class of autonomous neural networks with mixed time-varying delays are also discussed in this paper. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A strategic and tactical model for closed-loop supply chains	OR SPECTRUM					EURO Winter Institute on Location and Logistics	2007	Estoril, PORTUGAL	European Federat Operat Res Soc				In this paper, a strategic location-allocation model is developed for the simultaneous design of forward and reverse supply chains. Strategic decisions such as network design are accounted for together with tactical decisions, namely, production, storage and distribution planning. The integration between strategic and tactical decisions is achieved by considering two interconnected time scales: a macro and a micro time. At macro level, the supply chain is designed in order to account for the existing demands and returns, whose satisfaction is planned simultaneously at the micro level where tactical decisions are taken. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation is obtained which is solved to optimality using standard Branch & Bound techniques. Finally, the model accuracy and applicability is illustrated through the resolution of a case study.

Where Computation and Dynamics Meet: Heteroclinic Network-Based Controllers in Evolutionary Robotics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												In the fields of artificial neural networks and robotics, complicated, often high-dimensional systems can be designed using evolutionary/other algorithms to successfully solve very complex tasks. However, dynamical analysis of the underlying controller can often be near impossible, due to the high dimension and nonlinearities in the system. In this paper, we propose a more restricted form of controller, such that the underlying dynamical systems are forced to contain a dynamical object called a heteroclinic network. Systems containing heteroclinic networks share some properties with finite-state machines (FSMs) but are not discrete: both space and time are still described with continuous variables. Thus, we suggest that the heteroclinic networks can provide a hybrid between continuous and discrete systems. We investigate this innovated architecture in a minimal categorical perception task. The similarity of the controller to an FSM allows us to describe some of the system's behaviors as transition between states. However, other, essential behavior involves subtle ongoing interaction between the controller and the environment that eludes description at this level.

The nonlinear differential equations, that originally describes the CNN, is transformed into an equivalent set of equations that involves the space mode coefficients. Such a system of equations is able to describe the network in the whole state space and not only in the CNN linear region.

Current dynamic representation learning focuses on either discrete learning which results in temporal information loss, or continuous learning which involves heavy computation. In this study, we proposed a novel DGNN, sparse dynamic (Sparse-Dyn). It adaptively encodes temporal information into a sequence of patches with an equal amount of temporal-topological structure. Therefore, while avoiding using snapshots which cause information loss, it also achieves a finer time granularity, which is close to what continuous networks could provide. In addition, we also designed a lightweight module, Sparse Temporal Transformer, to compute node representations through structural neighborhoods and temporal dynamics. Since the fully connected attention conjunction is simplified, the computation cost is far lower than the current state-of-the-art. Link prediction experiments are conducted on both continuous and discrete graph data sets. By comparing several state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines, the experimental results demonstrate that Sparse-Dyn has a faster inference speed while having competitive performance.

Four different types of continuous and discrete design variables are chosen by the carcass path, width and angle of tread belts and the rubber modulus of sidewall and base strip, while the objective functions are defined by the peak strain energy at the belt edge and the peak shear strain of carcass. The approximate models of two objective functions are approximated by neural network, and mathematical sensitivity analysis is substituted with the iterative genetic evolution to deal with the discontinuous discrete-type design variables. The weights of two objective functions are traded-off by adjusting the aspiration levels with respect to the ideal levels.

Enhancing network resilience by adding redundancy to road networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW												In this paper, we develop a new tool to enhance the resilience of transportation networks by optimizing route diversity redundancy from travelers' perspective. The decision of where to add new links is made to generate as many origin-destination (O-D) pairs with alternative distinct routes as possible to potentially alleviate the impact of disruptions. Mathematically, we formulate the problem as a binary integer bi-level program (BLP), where the upper-level subprogram maximizes the total number of O-D pairs with alternative distinct routes subject to a budgetary constraint, and the lower-level subprogram counts the maximum number of distinct routes between each O-D pair under a given design scheme. Computationally, the BLP model can be equivalently reformulated as a single-level mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by using the equivalent continuous relaxation and optimality conditions of the lower-level subprogram and linearization techniques for the complementarity conditions. The globally optimum solution of the MILP structure of the reformulated model can be obtained using existing algorithms in commercial software packages. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity, features, and flexibility of the proposed route diversity-oriented network design model in terms of optimizing the network redundancy. The proposed route diversity redundant network design contributes toward enhancing network resilience against disruptions in the pre-disaster stage of transportation network planning and assists in redundancy-oriented time-dependent network growth. It can also serve as an upper-bound solution for the long-term network design problem when travelers' route choice behaviors and travel demands are considered in the design process.

The remaining of the workshop is modeled in a less precise way by using continuous model in order to describe only how the bottlenecks are fed. This used continuous model is a regression tree algorithm. For validation, this approach is applied to the modeling of a sawmill workshop and the results are compared with results obtained previously by using a neural network model.					, Thomas/A-4727-2013	, Thomas/0000-0001-9426-3570													1868-4238	1868-422X	978-3-662-44732-1				2014	440						530	537																WOS:000360158500066

A DC programming approach for solving multicast network design problems via the Nesterov smoothing technique	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION												This paper continues our recent effort in applying continuous optimization techniques to study optimal multicast communication networks modeled as bilevel hierarchical clustering problems. Given a finite number of nodes, we consider two different models of multicast networks by identifying a certain number of nodes as cluster centers, and at the same time, locating a particular node that serves as a total center so as to minimize the total transportation cost throughout the network. The fact that the cluster centers and the total center have to be among the given nodes makes these problems discrete optimization problems. Our approach is to reformulate the discrete problems as continuous ones and to apply Nesterov's smoothing approximation techniques on the Minkowski gauges that are used as distance measures. This approach enables us to propose two implementable DCA-based algorithms for solving the problems. Numerical results and practical applications are provided to illustrate our approach.

The main goal is to select from the set of available equipment units, those units that are better-suited for the production of the ingredient being considered. A minimum number of them. maximizes plant flexibility by leaving some free capacity to respond faster to other product orders, but also increases the makespan, because significant changeover times are mandatory. A tradeoff is thus involved that is quantified by an objective function that minimizes a weighted sum of the total equipment allocation cost plus the makespan, which is penalized with a cost factor. Because several product batches are needed, a stable mode of operation is assumed, with most of the schedule being derived by repetition of an optimal production pattern. This is obtained through the use of a resource-task network discrete-time periodic scheduling formulation that generates a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). For this particular case study, it is shown that the periodic schedule contains all the necessary information for easily deriving the startup and shutdown phases of production. The results have shown that the industrial problem is tractable and that a few minutes of computational time are sufficient to determine the optimal cycle time and corresponding schedule. To allow for more-complex problems to be tackled, a new decomposition strategy is proposed that reduces the computational effort by one order of magnitude without severely compromising optimality.

The proposed model formulation is believed to be superior to the available ones in the following aspects. In the first place, a continuous based time model is introduced and superstructures incorporating State-Task Network (STN), State-Equipment Network (SEN) and Gantt chart are adopted to capture all basic information of batch production and water-allocation network. Specifically, our superstructure is able to generate a class of optimum network structures which can never be captured by all previous frameworks. Then, costs of junctions and pipelines are added to evaluate and reduce the complexity of the network configuration. Finally, a hybrid optimization strategy integrating DICOPT and GA is developed for the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model and one example is presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.																					978-1-4398-0913-6; 978-1-4398-0912-9				2010							213	222																WOS:000392017300015

A sparse Gaussian copula regression model is used to account for the multivariate dependencies between any combination of discrete and/or continuous responses and their association with a set of predictors. We use the parameter expansion for data augmentation strategy to construct a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the estimation of the parameters and the latent variables of the model. Based on a centered parameterization of the Gaussian latent variables, we design a fixed-dimensional proposal distribution to update jointly the latent binary vectors of important predictors and the corresponding nonzero regression coefficients. For Gaussian responses and for outcomes that can be modeled as a dependent version of a Gaussian response, this proposal leads to a Metropolis-Hastings step that allows an efficient exploration of the predictors' model space. The proposed strategy is tested on simulated data and applied to real datasets in which the responses consist of low-intensity counts, binary, ordinal and continuous variables.

In these techniques the continuous characteristic of the current that charges (discharges) the load capacitor leads to a virtually switching free addition process that significantly reduces the switching noise. This switching mechanism also leads to higher slew of output voltage during the transitions which in turn reduces the cross talk. Simulation results demonstrate a three orders of magnitude reduction in the noise generated by this structure compared to that generated by a digital adder running at the same speed. This very good noise performance of these new adder structures makes them suitable choices for low to moderate speed high precision mixed signal applications.																			0277-786X		0-8194-3293-8				1999	3807						50	61		10.1117/12.367680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.367680													WOS:000085205800006

We find that after imposing a speed limit scheme, the total travel time of all road users may decrease or increase; road users of some OD pairs may experience longer travel time, while other OD pairs may have shorter travel time. In view of the importance of speed limits on network efficiency and equity, we subsequently develop a bi-level programming model for designing the optimal speed limit scheme that maximizes the network efficiency while considering the equity issue. A global optimization approach that is suitable for bi-level programming models with finite discrete upper-level decision variables is proposed.

Conventional offline optimization algorithms are time-consuming and unable to track time-varying optimal solutions in highly variable environments. In contrast, online algorithms are characterized by fast calculation speeds and the ability to continuously track optimal solutions, thus having great potential in solving optimization problems that vary rapidly over time. In this paper, we design online time-varying optimal power flow algorithms based on the latest online algorithms, including three discrete-time algorithms (i.e., correction only, prediction-correction, and correction-extra correction algorithms) and one continuous-time algorithm (i.e., prediction-correction interior-point method). According to our survey of the current applications of online algorithms, this study represents the first time that discrete-time prediction-correction and correction-extra correction algorithms have been applied in solving time-varying optimal power flow problems in active distribution networks. Detailed case studies, including correctness, validity, and sensitivity analysis, are carried out on a modified IEEE 33-node system. The numerical results reveal the advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of the proposed algorithms. Moreover, the characteristics of the discrete-time and continuous-time algorithms are compared intuitively. Finally, based on the numerical results, a guide for how to select an appropriate online time-varying optimal power flow algorithm for active distribution network optimization is provided, wherein the discrete-time prediction-correction optimal power flow algorithm is the most frequently recommended choice.

Stabilisation with feedback control utilising packet-dropping network links	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												The possibility of using networks, such as the Internet, for data transmission between physically distributed sensors and actuators in a system gives rise to several new challenges in control design. An approach is discussed for dealing with missing or delayed information because of packet drops or deteriorating network performance. More specifically, a stochastic set-up is used to find appropriate and optimal conditions for a system to remain stable despite packet drops. Both discrete-time and continuous-time systems are considered. Under reasonable assumptions on the behaviour of the network and the noise model, it is possible to characterise optimal control strategies in terms of the probability of a packet drop, the noise statistics, the instability of the open-loop system and, in the case of continuous-time systems, the sampling frequency.

To alleviate this problem delta operator based analysis and design has been proposed for high speed digital signal processing and control systems. The advantage for delta (delta) operator seems to come from the fact as sampling period T-s --> 0, the discrete time system process resembles that of continuous time system. In this paper we develop a unified cellular neural network (CNN) cell model using the delta operator approach. The model gives a general discrete-time (DT) CNN cell dynamics ill which the sampling period T-s is an expIicit parameter. As T-s --> 0, we get the continuous time (CT)-CNN equation. Several results connected with the stability and robustness of CT-CNN and DT-CNN can be linked using this approach. This approach highlights the similarities, rather than the differences between discrete and continuous CNNs, thus allowing continuous insights to be applied to the discrete CNN case. Further, more importantly from the implementation point of view delta operator based DT-CNN cell design can be obtained using delta(-1) as an integrator {instead of a delay (z(-1))}. The delta(-1) integrator can be realized using switched current/switched capacitor circuits. The dynamic circuit element in the DT-CNN is thus ''delta(-1)''.																					0-7803-3583-X				1997							577	580																WOS:A1997BJ47Z00145

A new class of Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman (HJB) equations is derived from applying the dynamic programming principle to continuous-time Q-functions. Our method is based on a novel semi-discrete version of the HJB equation, which is proposed to design a Q-learning algorithm that uses data collected in discrete time without discretizing or approximating the system dynamics. We identify the conditions under which the Q-function estimated by this algorithm converges to the optimal Q-function. For practical implementation, we propose the Hamilton-Jacobi DQN, which extends the idea of deep Q-networks (DQN) to our continuous control setting. This approach does not require actor networks or numerical solutions to optimization problems for greedy actions since the HJB equation provides a simple characterization of optimal controls via ordinary differential equations. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our method through benchmark tasks and high-dimensional linear-quadratic problems.

Scenario-based optimization problems need a large number of discrete scenarios to obtain a reliable approximation for the probabilistic model. It is important to choose typical scenarios and ease the computational burden. This paper presents a scenario reduction network model based on Wasserstein distance. Entropy regularization is used to transform the scenario reduction problem into an unconstrained problem. Through an explicit neural network structure design, the output of the scenario reduction network corresponds to the Sinkhorn distance function. The scenario reduction network can generate the typical scenario set through unsupervised learning. An efficient algorithm is proposed for continuous/discrete scenario reduction. The superiority of the scenario reduction network-model is verified through case studies. The numerical results highlight the high accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model over state-of-the-art models, and it makes an ideal candidate for large-scale scenario reduction problems.

A class of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy memristive neural networks (FMNNs) on time scales with discrete time-varying and infinite distributed delays is brought in this article. First, a new scale-limited Halanay inequality is demonstrated by timescale theory. Next, on the basis of inequality techniques on time scales, some new scale-limited algebraic criteria and linear matrix inequality criteria of Lagrange stability are obtained by comparison strategy and generalized Halanay inequality.

These problems are described as a class of design and pricing Stackelberg games and formulated as nonconvex, bilevel nonlinear programs. Such games capture interactions among the decisions of system designer/operator, government regulations and reactions of multi-class users on optimal toll-capacity combinations. The present class of games applies to a realistic urban highway with untolled alternative arterial links. In contrast with the mostly used continuous representations, the highway capacity is more intuitively expressed as a discrete variable, which further complicates the solution procedure. Hence, an evolutionary computing approach is employed to provide a stochastic global search of the optimal toll and capacity choices. The results offer valuable insights into how investment and pricing strategies can be deployed in regulated private road networks.

This work aims to design an efficient control scheme for the proposed systems in the case of non-symmetric dead-zone as the input due to the presence of which the control of such systems becomes very complex and difficult. The system is converted into an n-step ahead predictor and an adaptive compensative term is introduced to overcome the non-symmetric dead-zone present in the system. A hybrid neural network controller is constructed for the control of the proposed class of systems. The designed controller is proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded with the assistance of Lyapunov theory and the error is proved to approach very close to zero. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through two simulation examples and one example has been inspired from a real word system named continuous stirred tank reactor taken in discrete-time form which ensures the applicability of this controller in real-world applications.

Estimation of both continuous state and discrete sequence simultaneously based on the same output observations is a challenging task that is inherently nonlinear and often infinite dimensional. This article presents necessary and sufficient conditions when joint estimation is possible without using a probing input. When such conditions are not satisfied, a suitably designed input must be used to achieve the goal of jointly detecting the subsystem and estimating the internal state. This article employs certain structures of randomly switched linear systems to develop algorithms that use finite-dimensional estimators for continuous states and sampled data for detecting the discrete states. The convergence analysis shows that this framework can achieve convergence. Examples and simulation case studies are presented to illustrate the main results of this article.

In contrast, very little work has been done on mass exchange network synthesis (MENS) for batch process systems. The batch process systems referred to in this work can be defined as processes which operate discontinuously and deliver the products in discrete amounts, with frequent starts and stops. There is a clear need to develop a MENS procedure for batch process systems which are industrially very common as well as important. Techniques developed in this paper for the batch MENS involved the first key steps in the synthesis task,. i.e. setting the utility targets ahead of batch MEN design. The utility-targeting approach employs the vertical and horizontal cascading approaches in a newly developed too], i.e. time-dependent composition interval table that has been adapted from heat exchange network synthesis for batch processes. Prior to MEN design, the targeting procedure establishes the minimum utility (solvent) and mass storage targets for a maximum mass recovery network. These targets are essential for network design and batch process rescheduling. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.					Foo, Ir Dr Dominic C. Y./O-6335-2019	Foo, Ir Dr Dominic C.

This formulation explicitly considers variable processing times, which is a key aspect in the integration of scheduling and control decisions. The resulting Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem is solved using a custom Discrete-Steepest Descent Algorithm (D-SDA), which is designed to efficiently explore the ordered discrete decisions in the formulation, i.e., processing times and batching variables. The performance of the proposed solution framework is illustrated using two case studies adapted from the literature.

In this paper, we start by briefly surveying the main theoretical control problems that have been treated in the hybrid systems setting and classify them into stabilization, optimal control and language specification problems.

This paper is aimed at investigating the design of distributed parameter estimation algorithms and the analysis of their convergence properties in uncertain sensing and communication environments. Consensus-based distributed parameter estimation algorithms for both discrete-time and continuous-time cases are established, which are suitable for unreliable communication networks with stochastic communication noises, random link gains and Markovian signal losses. Under mild conditions on stochastic noises, gain function and topology-switching Markov chain, we establish both the mean square and almost sure convergence of the designed algorithms by use of probability limit theory, algebraic graph theory, stochastic differential equation theory and Markov chain theory. The effect of sensor-dependent gain functions on the convergence of the algorithm is also analyzed.

Particle Swarm Optimization applied to the design of water supply systems	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS												In the past decade, evolutionary methods have been used by various researchers to tackle optimal design problems for water supply systems (WSS). Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of these evolutionary algorithms which, in spite of the fact that it has primarily been developed for the solution of optimization problems with continuous variables, has been successfully adapted in other contexts to problems with discrete variables. In this work we have applied one of the variants of this algorithm to two case studies: the Hanoi water distribution network and the New York City water supply tunnel system. Both cases occur frequently in the related literature and provide two standard networks for benchmarking Studies.

Control of UPFC Using Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Formulation Based Neural Network	2012 IEEE POWER AND ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING	IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM				General Meeting of the IEEE-Power-and-Energy-Society	JUL 22-26, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE Power & Energy Soc				In this paper, the micro grid stability is investigated by utilizing a non-linear optimal controller and FACTS device. Using micro grid continuous-time model and control design impose a huge computational burden due to the required high sampling rate to achieve stability when utilizing a digital controller. Thus, developing of an advanced discrete-time (DT) stabilizing controller design is of paramount importance in the micro grids. In this paper a nonlinear discrete-time stabilizing controller using Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is proposed for micro grids by employing the discrete-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) optimal control method. The designed optimal controller is applied to control the UPFC's series voltage and to optimally mitigate the power oscillations. The micro grid under consideration is comprised of a synchronous generator, renewable energy sources, and loads. The UPFC series voltage is considered as control input and the optimal strategy is applied. A discretized micro grid nonlinear dynamical model is derived and successive approximation method is utilized to approximate the cost function of the generator states and the UPFC control parameters. Finally, a neural network (NN) is utilized to approximate the cost function using the weighted residual method. By applying the developed optimal controller, it is shown that oscillations caused by faults are mitigated more effectively compared to the conventional generator controllers.

In this work, we focus on the joint US-BF design with the goal of maximizing the set cardinality of scheduled users, which is computationally challenging due to the non-convex objective function and the coupled constraints with discrete-continuous variables. To tackle these difficulties, a successive convex approximation based US-BF (SCA-USBF) optimization algorithm is firstly proposed. Then, inspired by wireless intelligent communication, a graph neural network based joint US-BF (J-USBF) learning algorithm is developed by combining the joint US and power allocation network model with the BF analytical solution. The effectiveness of SCA-USBF and J-USBF is verified by various numerical results, the latter achieves close performance and higher computational efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed J-USBF also enjoys the generalizability in dynamic wireless network scenarios.					chen, xiao/KFQ-6812-2024; yi, li/KFR-6141-2024; Zhang, Yuyao/KEH-7175-2024; Ding, Yang/JUV-4842-2023; Li, Jiawei/JOJ-9277-2023; Wang, Weiyi/JZC-7841-2024; Liu, min/JXW-8493-2024; Yuan, Ye/KBC-9835-2024; zhou, han/JUV-0193-2023	Yuan, Ye/0009-0008-1640-7047; An, Zhenyu/0000-0002-8672-2009													1536-1276	1558-2248				MAY	2023	22	5					2975	2988		10.1109/TWC.2022.3215666	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2022.3215666													WOS:000991554300007

Due to the additional signal processing cost introduced by cooperative communication, the cellular links who have the exclusive usage right of the network spectrum can charge the D2D links a fee for spectrum usage to enhance their profit. In this paper, we propose a contract-based cooperative spectrum sharing mechanism to exploit transmission opportunities for the D2D links and meanwhile achieve the maximum profit of the cellular links. We first design a cooperative relaying scheme that employs superposition coding at both the cellular transmitters and D2D transmitters. The cooperative relaying scheme can maximize the data rate of the D2D links without deteriorating the performance of the cellular links. Then, we employ a contract-theoretic framework to model the spectrum trading process based on the cooperative relaying scheme, and derive the optimal power-payment contracts for the cellular links under both the cases that the private information (i.e., channel quality) of the D2D links is continuous and discrete using tools from continuous- and discrete-time optimal control theories, respectively. Analytic and numerical results confirm the efficiency of the proposed spectrum sharing mechanism.

The use of classical mathematical programming approaches, like NLP, MILP and MINLP has reached a cruising speed, even when Linear or Successive Linear Programming methods are less and less used. Due to the highly combinatorial nature of many problems, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms begin to compete with mathematical programming approaches. For optimal control purposes, Neural Networks appear to be an efficient tool.

The idea is to embed the discrete topology representation into the continuous admittance space and train a DNN to learn the mapping from (load, admittance) to the corresponding OPF solution. We then employ the trained DNN to solve AC-OPF problems over any power network with the same bus, generation, and line capacity configurations but different topology and/or line admittances.

In order to save the design cost of a network, which contains a nonlinear relationship between hydraulic energy loss and water flowrate, researchers have traditionally used mathematical optimization approaches. However, they have been more interested in meta-heuristic approaches recently because (1) these approaches directly provide commercial discrete diameters instead of impractical continuous ones; (2) they do not require complex gradient derivatives and free from divergence; (3) they do not require starting feasible vector and have more chance to find global optimum, etc. This study presents a new real-world example for the water network design, hoping to be a good literature. Furthermore, this study newly considers a more practical constraint (flow velocity range) that can avoid a critical problem of water hammer or pipe choking by sedimentation. Then, the numerical example is solved using a meta-heuristic algorithm named harmony search, and the results are compared with those from a mathematical approach.

Based on a practical and general model of actuator faults, the faulty networked control system is modeled as a Markovian jump system with two additive random delays. By using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, the sufficient conditions on stochastic stability and H-infinity performance for the faulty networked control system are given. The corresponding controllers design methods are proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, the proposed approach is extended to uncertain networked control system with actuator faults.

Design of Experiments for Categorical Repeated Measurements in Packet Communication Networks	TECHNOMETRICS												We study the optimal measurement of packet loss and delay in packet networks by treating all measurements as numerical experiments to which we apply the theory of the design of experiments. Specifically we seek to find the optimal times at which to inject survey (probe) packets. Our approach is to model the target node in the packet communication network, an access buffer, as a discrete-time Markov chain. Given that we may only make a limited number of observations, we present a method for optimally designing the observation times for the chain, and derive both exact and continuous optimal designs. Our results show that, for common optimality criteria, measuring at a uniform rate may not be optimal. This has significance for influencing commercial practice as uniform probing is standard. We show how our method may be generalized to Markov systems with larger state space, and describe computational methods to find optimal designs on any system which evolves according to the Markov principle.

Data Aggregation in Low-Power Wireless Sensor Networks With Discrete Transmission Ranges: Sensor Signal Aggregation Over Graph	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL												Conventional wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of sensors with continuous transmission range, which depends on the relative positions of the transmitter and the receiver. However, sensors with different discrete transmission ranges are preferred for future generation low-power sensor networks because of certain functional advantages. The discrete transmission ranges introduce connectivity constraints in transmitting the sensor data. The proliferation of low-power WSNs has led to the explosion of the volume of the data to be processed. As the transmission of the data is the major cause of energy depletion of sensors that critically affect the network lifetime, energy-efficient aggregation of the sensor data is an important networking problem. In this work, we address the data aggregation problem in networks with sensors of discrete transmission ranges. We model the problem as a solvable integer linear program. However, this method applies only to networks of small sizes because of the hardness of the program. To solve the problem in networks of large sizes, we introduce a graphical framework that captures the characteristics of the networks with sensors of discrete transmission ranges and design a polynomial-time approximation technique to find a solution. Furthermore, we embed compression techniques based on compressed sensing (CS), which are established to yield high data compaction for temporally and spatially correlated distributed sensor data streams, and evaluate the performance of the proposed methods.

J	Borri, A; Pola, G; Di Benedetto, MD				Borri, Alessandro; Pola, Giordano; Di Benedetto, Maria Domenica			Design of Symbolic Controllers for Networked Control Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												Networked control systems (NCSs) are distributed systems where plants, sensors, actuators, and controllers communicate over shared networks. Nonideal behaviors of the communication network include variable sampling/transmission intervals and communication delays, packet losses, communication constraints, and quantization errors. NCSs have been the object of intensive study in the last few years. However, due to the inherent complexity of NCSs, the current literature focuses on a subset of these nonidealities and mostly considers stability and stabilizability problems. Recent technology advances need different and more complex control objectives to be considered. In this paper, we present first a general model of NCS, including most relevant nonidealities of the communication network; then, we propose a symbolic model approach to the control design with objectives expressed in terms of nondeterministic transition systems. The presented results are based on recent advances in symbolic control design of continuous and hybrid systems. An example in the context of robot motion planning with remote control is included, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

As a discrete time-variant problem, the existing solving schemes generally need the theoretical support under the continuous-time framework, and there is no independent solving scheme under the discrete-time framework. The theoretical deficiency of solving scheme greatly limits the theoretical research and practical application of discrete time-variant matrix inequalities. In this article, new discrete-time recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms are proposed, analyzed, and investigated for solving different time-variant matrix inequalities under the discrete-time framework, including discrete time-variant matrix vector inequality (discrete time-variant MVI), discrete time-variant generalized matrix inequality (discrete time-variant GMI), discrete time-variant generalized-Sylvester matrix inequality (discrete time-variant GSMI), and discrete time-variant complicated-Sylvester matrix inequality (discrete time-variant CSMI), and all solving processes are based on the direct discretization thought. Specifically, first of all, four discrete time-variant matrix inequalities are presented as the target problems of these researches. Second, for solving such problems, we propose corresponding discrete-time recurrent neural network (RNN) (DT-RNN) algorithms (termed DT-RNN-MVI algorithm, DT-RNN-GMI algorithm, DT-RNN-GSMI algorithm, and DT-RNN-CSMI algorithm), which are different from the traditional DT-RNN design thought because second-order Taylor expansion is applied to derive the DT-RNN algorithms. This creative process avoids the intervention of continuous-time framework. Then, theoretical analyses are presented, which show the convergence and precision of the DT-RNN algorithms. Abundant numerical experiments are further carried out, which further confirm the excellent properties of the DT-RNN algorithms.

The proposed model consists of two phases: inserting passenger requests dynamically in an interactive manner (dynamic phase) and optimizing the service network statically based on the overall demand (static phase). In the dynamic phase, we propose a hierarchical decision-making model to describe the interactive manner between operator and passengers. The CB network design problem is formulated in a mixed-integer program with the objective of maximizing operator's revenue. The CB passenger's travel behavior is measured by a discrete choice model given the trip plan provided by the operator. A dynamic insertion method is developed to address the proposed model in the dynamic phase. For the network design problem in the static phase, the service network is re-optimized based on the confirmed passengers with strict time deviation constraints embedded in the static multi-vehicle pickup and delivery problem. An exact solution method is developed based on the branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm. Numerical examples are conducted to verify the proposed models and solution algorithms.

The observability of this class of systems depends on the system inputs and on the output sampling time. While several studies have addressed this problem in the case of continuous-time output measurements, few are those who have approached the case of discrete-time. Among the estimation strategies proposed in the literature, we used the high gain technique. Having the mathematical model of a hydrographic network formed by three cascaded tanks, we are interested here, in estimating two liquid levels from the discrete measurements of the other level.

J	Kishida, N; Nakamura, H; Ohsaki, S; Watano, S				Kishida, Naoki; Nakamura, Hideya; Ohsaki, Shuji; Watano, Satoru			Development of ultra-fast computing method for powder mixing process	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Powder mixing is an important operation in many industries. Numerical simulations using the discrete element method (DEM) have been widely used to analyze powder-mixing processes. However, one of the current limi-tations of the DEM simulation is its high computational cost. Recently, approaches that combine machine learning models and numerical simulations have attracted considerable attention for high-speed computing. However, there has been no research on high-speed computing methods for powder mixing that account for individual particle motions. Here, we propose an original machine learning model, namely, a recurrent neural network with stochastically calculated random motion (RNNSR), which enables a long-time-scale powder mixing simulation with low computational cost and high accuracy. The RNNSR is designed to learn individual particle dynamics with periodicity from short-term DEM simulation results and predict powder mixing for a longer period. The RNNSR combines a recurrent neural network and a stochastic model to predict both convective and diffusive mixing. The simulation results obtained using the RNNSR were quite similar to those obtained using the DEM in terms of the degree of powder mixing, particle velocity, and granular temperature. It was also demonstrated that the RNNSR has the capability of ultrafast computing in powder-mixing simulations. In conclusion, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the RNNSR for ultrafast computation of the powder mixing process.

The 2-D continuous analysis versus the Density Force Method (discrete) for structural membrane equilibrium	INFORMES DE LA CONSTRUCCION												This paper deals with the equilibrium problem of a membrane, presenting a comparison between the well-known 1-D discrete Force Density Method, using spatial cable networks as membrane surface approximations, and the 2-D continuous analysis of such a surface. Although Force Density is a practical and powerful method in structural membrane design, it will be checked that the 2-D continuous analysis is not only more accurate and general but necessary for new structural membrane applications such as footbridges. In this way, once summarized the discrete Density Force Method, the continuous approach is presented.

First, the model of a non-uniform transmission closed-loop fault system was established, which includes the network attribute, actuator saturation constraints, estimation value of fault and state, event-triggered condition, disturbance information and so on. Second, the method of fault estimation with H-infinity-performance was proposed by a continuous time state observer. Furthermore, a satisfactory integrated design method integrating event-triggered fault accommodation and network communication saving was given for non-uniform transmission nonlinear NCSs with alpha-stability and H-infinity/H-2 performance. Finally, a MATLAB simulation was conducted to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method based on a nonlinear NCS example. In order to reflect the real network transmission circumstances fully, a semi entity experimental platform was also built to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.																			2169-3536						2020	8						70293	70305		10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986058													WOS:000549829900017

In light of recent developments, in the first part of our work, we design a CT accelerated gradient algorithm for strongly connected directed graphs. We show that the convergence is exponential and the convergence rate is proportional to the gradient gain which is chosen arbitrarily. To facilitate implementation of the algorithm over communication networks, in the second part of our work, we design an event-based broadcasting protocol that intermittently checks for events by evaluating an event-triggering condition and accordingly makes decision on broadcasting. The distributed system, with CT dynamics and discrete-time (event-based) broadcasts, is reformulated as a hybrid dynamical system which is devoid of Zeno solutions. Finally, we provide a numerical example to demonstrate our results.

For any given traffic load the network can be operated in this region by adjusting frequency and voltage. For a deflective routing network we propose the design of a central controller for dynamic frequency and voltage scaling. Given history information including the load and frequency in the network, the controller adjusts the frequency and voltage such that the network operates just below the saturation point. We provide control mechanisms for continuous and discrete frequency ranges. With a discrete frequency range and taking into account voltage switching delays, we evaluate the control mechanism under stochastic, smoothly varying and very bursty traffic. Experiments demonstrate that adaptive control is very effective in minimizing power consumption at reasonable performance. Compared with a fixed high frequency network, the adaptively controlled network is significantly more power efficient. We compare it to fixed frequency networks, which are either too slow exhibiting unbounded delays, or are dimensioned for the worst case with very high frequency and are very power hungry.																					0-7695-2609-8				2006							649	+																WOS:000242376400087

Synthetic tetracycline-inducible regulatory networks: computer-aided design of dynamic phenotypes	BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY												Background: Tightly regulated gene networks, precisely controlling the expression of protein molecules, have received considerable interest by the biomedical community due to their promising applications. Among the most well studied inducible transcription systems are the tetracycline regulatory expression systems based on the tetracycline resistance operon of Escherichia coli, Tet-Off (tTA) and Tet-On (rtTA). Despite their initial success and improved designs, limitations still persist, such as low inducer sensitivity. Instead of looking at these networks statically, and simply changing or mutating the promoter and operator regions with trial and error, a systematic investigation of the dynamic behavior of the network can result in rational design of regulatory gene expression systems. Sophisticated algorithms can accurately capture the dynamical behavior of gene networks. With computer aided design, we aim to improve the synthesis of regulatory networks and propose new designs that enable tighter control of expression. Results: In this paper we engineer novel networks by recombining existing genes or part of genes. We synthesize four novel regulatory networks based on the Tet-Off and Tet-On systems. We model all the known individual biomolecular interactions involved in transcription, translation, regulation and induction. With multiple time-scale stochastic-discrete and stochastic-continuous models we accurately capture the transient and steady state dynamics of these networks. Important biomolecular interactions are identified and the strength of the interactions engineered to satisfy design criteria. A set of clear design rules is developed and appropriate mutants of regulatory proteins and operator sites are proposed. Conclusion: The complexity of biomolecular interactions is accurately captured through computer simulations. Computer simulations allow us to look into the molecular level, portray the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks and rationally engineer novel ones with useful applications. We are able to propose, test and accept or reject design principles for each network. Guided by simulations, we develop a set of design principles for novel tetracycline-inducible networks.

The purpose is to design a mode-dependent linear filtering which ensures that, for all admissible uncertainties, the filtering error system is not only stochastically asymptotically stable in the large, but also satisfies a prescribed H-infinity-leo norm level. Some novel mode-dependent and delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem are obtained. The desired filter can be constructed by solving a set of strict linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To address those challenges, this work introduces Design Strategy network (DSN), a data-driven deep hierarchical framework that can learn strategies over these arbitrary complex action spaces. The hierarchical architecture decomposes every action decision into first predicting a preferred spatial region in the design space and then outputting a probability distribution over a set of possible actions from that region. This framework comprises a convolutional encoder to work with image-based design state representations, a multi-layer perceptron to predict a spatial region, and a weight-sharing network to generate a probability distribution over unordered set-based inputs of feasible actions. Applied to a truss design study, the framework learns to predict the actions of human designers in the study, capturing their truss generation strategies in the process. Results show that DSNs significantly outperform nonhierarchical methods of policy representation, demonstrating their superiority in complex action space problems.

At the same time, we determine the optimal decision profiles that lead to minimum capital cost. Decision variables include the feed rates of initiator, monomers and catalyst, reactor temperature, residence time, number and location of monomer injection points. Moreover, we narrow down the types of continuous reactors that can be part of the network to two: plug flow reactor (PFR) with multiple feed injection points and continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The PFR model is a differential algebraic equation (DAE) optimization problem. The simultaneous collocation method is applied to transform the DAE into a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the MINLP, where binary variables are manually fixed. The result of this strategy shows that the reactor configuration with minimum capital cost is a PFR with ten monomer injection points. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, these oscillators are sensitive to initial conditions and downstream load processes. Furthermore, the oscillations are not sustained since the inherently closed design suffers from enzyme deactivation, NTP fuel exhaustion, and waste product build up. Recently, we had shown that a partially open architecture in which a continuous-time L-1 adaptive controller, implemented inside an in silico computer that resides outside the wet-lab apparatus, can ensure sustained tunable oscillations in two specific designs of the Kim-Winfree oscillator networks. Here, we present its discrete-time version. As before, we consider two broad cases of operation: (1) the oscillator network operating in isolation, and (2) the oscillator network driving a DNA tweezer subject to a variable load. In both scenarios, our simulation results show a significant improvement in the tunability and robustness of these oscillator networks. Our approach can be easily adopted to improve the loading capacity of a wide range of synthetic biological devices.

The physical plant and the controller are, respectively, in continuous time And discrete time. By using a sampled-data approach, a new model based on the updating instants of the holder is formulated, and a linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based procedure is proposed for designing state-feedback controllers, which guarantee that the output of the closed-loop networked control system tracks the output of a given reference model well in the H-infinity sense. Both network-induced delays and data packet dropouts have been taken into consideration in the controller design. The network-induced delays are assumed to have both an upper bound and a lower bound, which is more general than those used in the literature. The introduction of the lower bound is shown to be advantageous for reducing conservatism. Moreover, the controller design method is further extended to more general cases, where the system matrices of the physical plant contain parameter uncertainties, represented in either polytopic or norm-bounded frameworks. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed H-infinity output tracking design.

The mixed time-delays comprise both the discrete time-varying delays and infinitely distributed delays. The round-robin protocol (RRP) is employed to schedule the data transmissions from the sensors to the observer so as to mitigate the communication burden and prevent the data collisions. A novel PIO is developed whose observer gain is dependent on the data transmission order as a reflection of the effects induced by the RRP scheduling. By resorting to the token-dependent Lyapunov functional and the matrix inequality technique, the desired PIO is designed with exponentially stable error dynamics of the state estimation and guaranteed l(2)-l(infinity) disturbance attenuation/resistance capacity. Finally, a simulation example is exploited to verify the validity of the proposed observer design method.

The upper-level subprogram is to maximize the total social welfare given certain toll level constraints. The lower level subprogram is a traditional user equilibrium problem with elastic demand. The proposed GA model is applied to the Sioux Falls network, which has 76 links and 24 OD-pairs, assuming homogeneous users. Comprehensive numerical results including solutions achieved under continuous tolling and discrete tolling schemes, tolling on optimized links and tolling on heuristically selected most congested links are carefully presented and compared. The impact of value of time and the elastic demand sensitivity are also comprehensively investigated.

A hybrid framework for resource allocation among multiple agents moving on discrete environments	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												We consider the problem of controlling a multi-agent system whose agents move across discrete locations. The agents attempt to extract resources from the environment while the environment, which may vary as the system evolves, distributes its resources according to the agents requests. The environment is modeled as a network of discrete nodes. Our ultimate goal is to design the dynamical policies that determine the behavior of agents and nodes, such that the usage of resources in the network is optimized. We propose a hybrid model to describe both agents and nodes. Several components of this model are design variables that may be obtained analytically. We then formulate an optimization problem that may be decomposed into two hierarchical optimization problems: an integer optimization problem that considers the distribution of agents among the nodes of the network; and a convex optimization problem within each node that corresponds to the distribution of resources of each node among its resident agents. We show that the optimization problem within each node is a special case of the formulation that models congestion control algorithms in the internet. We then use available results to solve a portion of the proposed hybrid description for agents and nodes. Moreover, we show that the resulting continuous dynamics are globally asymptotically stable, with their equilibrium point coinciding with the solution of the optimization problem. As a consequence, the proposed continuous dynamics yield an interconnected system that is stable on each possible configuration of agents and nodes.

CTRNNs are known to be universal dynamical approximators: given a large enough system, the parameters of a CTRNN can be tuned to produce output that is arbitrarily close to that of any other dynamical system. However, in practice, both designing systems of CTRNN to have a certain output, and the reverse-understanding the dynamics of a given system of CTRNN-can be nontrivial. In this article, we describe a method for embedding any specified Turing machine in its entirety into a CTRNN. As such, we describe in detail a continuous time dynamical system that performs arbitrary discrete-state computations. We suggest that in acting as both a continuous time dynamical system and as a computer, the study of such systems can help refine and advance the debate concerning the Computational Hypothesis that cognition is a form of computation and the Dynamical Hypothesis that cognitive systems are dynamical systems.																			2162-237X	2162-2388				2024 MAY 16	2024										10.1109/TNNLS.2024.3397995	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2024.3397995		MAY 2024						38753481					WOS:001226148900001

The novel architecture is beneficial for coverage, flexibility, and reliability. However, reducing network latency is a critical issue. In this paper, we design a UAV-aided network with a millimeter wave (mmWave) backhaul to achieve the multi-access edge computing. The routing problem is formulated and solved first to obtain the optimal routes through the ad hoc link for all users. Then, we formulate the joint trajectory design and resource allocation problem, which is a mixed-integer nonconvex programming, to minimize the network latency. Furthermore, we design a novel iterative algorithm framework to handle this challenging problem. In the outer loop, the proposed problem is separated into the primal problems and master problems by adopting generalized benders decomposition (GBD). In the inner loop, we design the algorithm to solve the continuous nonconvex primal problem by combining the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), Dinkelbach algorithm, and successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm framework is effective and feasible.

In this paper, a RAN slicing framework is proposed and systematically analyzed from the physical layer perspective. According to the baseband and radio frequency (RF) configurations imparities among slices, we categorize four scenarios and elaborate on the numerology relationships of slices configurations. By considering the most generic scenario, system models are established for both uplink and downlink transmissions. Besides, a low out of band emission (OoBE) waveform is implemented in the system for the sake of signal isolation and inter-service/slice-band-interference (ISBI) mitigation. We propose two theorems as the basis of algorithms design in the established system, which generalize the original circular convolution property of discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Moreover, ISBI cancellation algorithms are proposed based on a collaboration detection scheme, where joint slices signal models are implemented. The framework proposed in the paper establishes a foundation to underpin extremely diverse use cases in 5G that implement on a common infrastructure.

However, a less known but powerful result is that a NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem of operators is suggestive of the structure and potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning continuous operators or complex systems from streams of scattered data. Here, we thus extend this theorem to DNNs. We design a new network with small generalization error, the deep operator network (DeepONet), which consists of a DNN for encoding the discrete input function space (branch net) and another DNN for encoding the domain of the output functions (trunk net). We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations. We study different formulations of the input function space and its effect on the generalization error for 16 different diverse applications.

Unlike continuous event-triggered mechanism (ETM) requiring dedicated hardware and complex Zeno-avoidance computation, an output-based discrete ETM is firstly introduced, which overcomes limits of continuous ETM and relaxes state-available constraint. Secondly, a novel time-delay system model is established, which makes it possible to study effects of the ETM, stochastic attacks and network-induced delays in a unified framework. Thirdly, less-conservative asymptotic stability criteria with desired H-infinity index are obtained, which derive quantitative relationships among the ETM, stochastic attacks, network delays, plant and resilient controller. Further, sufficient conditions to co-deign the ETM and resilient controller are presented. Finally, examples confirm effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, these networks face challenges due to the nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard issue, which results in exponentially increasing computational complexity as the problem size grows. Conventional digital hardware struggles with the von Neumann bottleneck, the slowdown of Moore's law, and the complexity arising from heterogeneous system design. Two-dimensional (2D) memristors offer a potential solution to these hardware challenges, with their in-memory computing, decent scalability, and rich dynamic behaviors. In this study, we explore the use of nonvolatile 2D memristors to emulate synapses in a discrete-time Hopfield neural network, enabling the network to solve continuous optimization problems, like finding the minimum value of a quadratic polynomial, and tackle combinatorial optimization problems like Max-Cut. Additionally, we coupled volatile memristor-based oscillators with nonvolatile memristor synapses to create an oscillatory neural network-based Ising machine, a continuous-time analog dynamic system capable of solving combinatorial optimization problems including Max-Cut and map coloring through phase synchronization. Our findings demonstrate that 2D memristors have the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency, compactness, and homogeneity of integrated Ising machines, which is useful for future advances in neural networks for optimization problems.

The general activation functions include monotone nondecreasing functions, globally Lipschitz continuous and monotone nondecreasing functions, semi-Lipschitz continuous mixed monotone functions, and Lipschitz continuous functions. For each class of activation functions, testable algebraic criteria for ascertaining global exponential periodicity and global exponential stability of a class of recurrent neural networks are derived by using the comparison principle and the theory of monotone operator. Furthermore, the rate of exponential convergence and bounds of attractive domain of periodic oscillations or equilibrium points are also estimated. The convergence analysis based on the generalization of activation functions widens the application scope for the model design of neural networks. In addition, the new effective analytical method enriches the toolbox for the qualitative analysis of neural networks. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we investigate a multi-UAV communication system with moving users and consider the co-channel interference caused by the transmissions of all other UAVs. To ensure the fairness, we maximize the minimum average user rate during the observed time by jointly optimizing UAVs' trajectories, transmission power, and user association. Considering that UAVs can cover a large area for communications, UAVs do not need to move as soon as the users move. Therefore, a two-timescale structure is proposed for the considered scenario, where the UAVs' trajectories are optimized based on the channel state information (CSI) in a long timescale, while the transmission power and the user association are optimized based on the instantaneous CSI in a short timescale. To effectively tackle this challenging non-convex problem with both discrete and continuous variables, we propose a joint neural network (NN) design, where a deep reinforcement learning based Pointer Network named advantage pointer-critic (APC) is applied to optimize discrete variables and a deep-unfolding NN is used to optimize the continuous variables. Specifically, we first formulate a Markov decision process to model the user association, and then employ the APC network trained by the advantage actor-critic algorithm to address it. The APC network consists of a Pointer Network and a Multilayer Perceptron. As for the deep-unfolding NN, we first develop a block coordinate descent based algorithm to optimize the UAVs' trajectories and transmission power, and then unfold the algorithm into a layer-wise NN with introduced trainable parameters. These two networks are jointly trained in an unsupervised fashion. Simulation results validate that the proposed joint NN significantly outperforms the optimization algorithm with much lower complexity, and achieves good performances on scalability and generalization ability.

A hybrid Petri nets model of networked manufacturing systems and its control system architecture	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT												Purpose - To introduce a Petri nets model that describes a networked manufacturing system and its dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - A hybrid Petri nets model is constructed, the continuous part of which is to describe the dynamics of the production process within a manufacturing system and the discrete part of which is to describe the dynamics of the ordering and delivering process between every two manufacturing systems. In addition, the mathematical formulation of the dynamics of networked manufacturing systems is proposed to describe its behaviors in detail. Based on the model, the control system architecture of networked manufacturing systems is constructed to make and execute the production plan, solve the conflicts among manufacturing systems and realize the reconfiguration of the network. Findings - There are two key aspects in the dynamics of this hybrid system: first, in the continuous part of this hybrid system, the production process, the variables are discrete. Accordingly, the change of the systems states is not always continuous. Second, in the discrete part of this hybrid system the control variables are actually the safety and objective inventory levels and the minimum quantity of cumulative orders to trigger deliveries which determine the time and quantities of ordering or delivery. However, the relations between them are non-linear. Originality/value - Based on the model, the control system architecture of networked manufacturing systems can be constructed to make and execute the production plan, solve the conflicts among manufacturing systems and realize the reconfiguration of the network.

Different from most previous research, delayed MNNs are described by continuous differential equations with 2(2n2+n) variables where the memductances of memristors are continuously dependent on the fluxes. Both system delays and input delays are considered, and the delays and their derivatives may vary in intervals whose lower bounds are not restricted to be zero. The systems are further reduced to continuous-time neural networks (NNs) with interval matrix uncertainties, and a unified method is developed to solve the stability of delayed NNs and MNNs. Stability criteria are obtained for delayed MNNs by augmented Lyapunov functionals, Wirtinger-based integral inequality, reciprocally convex approach, and linear matrix inequalities. In the end, two numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the validity of our theorems.					li, yao/IYJ-1364-2023; Liu, Jiayu/JCO-5073-2023; Xin, Youming/ADX-6518-2022; liu, jiayu/JCP-0511-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023	Xin, Youming/0000-0001-6484-8631													2168-2216	2168-2232				MAY	2023	53	5					2716	2725		10.1109/TSMC.2022.3218347	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2022.3218347		NOV 2022											WOS:000881949500001

During control intervals, PAIDOC is based on discrete-time state observations and is implemented to a fraction of the network nodes, which is an extension of existing literature. In light of stochastic analysis theory and Lyapunov method, we establish improved quasi-synchronization criteria. Compared with previous quasi-synchronization results on HHSDNs, the piecewise continuous, time-varying, and indefinite functions replace the constant coefficient of the upper bound estimation for the operator of a Lyapunov function in the available literature, i.e., it can be positive or negative along time evolution, which shows wider applications of our results. Especially, our results can be directly applied to examine the quasi-synchronization problem via PAIDOC based on the average control rate. Subsequently, some easily-verified quasi-synchronization criteria are presented and a detailed algorithm about how to design suitable PAIDOC is provided. In the end, the theoretical result is applied to spring-mass-damper systems and numerical examples are presented.					xu, Dong-sheng/B-7524-2013														1545-5955	1558-3783				2024 MAR 18	2024										10.1109/TASE.2024.3374721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2024.3374721		MAR 2024											WOS:001189524700001

Unfortunately, experimental techniques such as 2D LDV measurements provide only limited discrete information at given points; especially, for the cases of complex flows such as free vortex dump combustor swirling flows. For this type of flows, usual numerical interpolating schemes appear to be unsuitable. Recently, neural networks have emerged as viable means of expanding a finite data set of experimental measurements to enhance better understanding of a particular complex phenomenon. This study showed that artificial neural networks are suitable for the prediction of free vortex turbulent swirling flow characteristics in a model dump combustor. These techniques are proposed for optimum designs of dump combustors and ramjet engines.																			1093-4928		978-0-7918-4475-5				2012							783	788																WOS:000324506700089

Their impact on received power at ground deployed sensor node is characterized. For this purpose, a generalized radiation pattern of UAV-mounted transmitter antenna is considered. A closed-form expression of received power at the sensor node is obtained for each of these four cases. An optimization problem is formulated with the objective of optimizing the system parameters, such as transmit power, hovering altitude, and antenna exponent. This problem contains mixed nature of variables, i.e., continuous as well as discrete. To solve this problem, an algorithm, called Hovering Inaccuracy-aware Optimal Charging System Design (HI-OCSD), is proposed to find the optimal system parameters. Through system simulations it is demonstrated that, hovering inaccuracy has notable impact on the performance, as received power at the sensor node reduces significantly in presence of hovering inaccuracy compared to ideal scenario. The effect of LM is more severe than that of OM. Further, a scenario with different level of hovering inaccuracy accounting for different deployment scenarios is considered, and the optimal system parameters are also evaluated. This study reveals that, UAV needs to hover at a relatively higher altitude to overcome the severity of hovering inaccuracy.

Design procedures for implementing such multi-band impedance inverting networks and multi-band POLs at arbitrary frequencies are presented here. For validating the design procedures, tri/quad-band Doherty PAs are designed, fabricated and tested using continuous wave (CW) and modulated signals in discrete mode and concurrent mode.

J	Tang, Y; Wang, ZD; Fang, JA				Tang, Yang; Wang, Zidong; Fang, Jian-an			Controller design for synchronization of an array of delayed neural networks using a controllable probabilistic PSO	INFORMATION SCIENCES												In this paper, a controllable probabilistic particle swarm optimization (CPPSO) algorithm is introduced based on Bernoulli stochastic variables and a competitive penalized method. The CPPSO algorithm is proposed to solve optimization problems and is then applied to design the memoryless feedback controller, which is used in the synchronization of an array of delayed neural networks (DNNs). The learning strategies occur in a random way governed by Bernoulli stochastic variables. The expectations of Bernoulli stochastic variables are automatically updated by the search environment. The proposed method not only keeps the diversity of the swarm, but also maintains the rapid convergence of the CPPSO algorithm according to the competitive penalized mechanism. In addition, the convergence rate is improved because the inertia weight of each particle is automatically computed according to the feedback of fitness value. The efficiency of the proposed CPPSO algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with some well-known PSO algorithms on benchmark test functions with and without rotations. In the end, the proposed CPPSO algorithm is used to design the controller for the synchronization of an array of continuous-time delayed neural networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The mixed delays consist of discrete time-varying and distributed delays. The stochastic nonlinearities satisfy statistical means. The missing measurement is modeled by a Bernoulli-distributed random variable. By applying stochastic analysis method we present sufficient conditions guaranteeing the stochastic finite-time boundedness of a closed-loop system with desired H infinity performance level within a finite time interval. Moreover, dynamic output feedback controller can be obtained in terms of a set of matrix inequalities, which can be easily solved by using the cone complementarity linearization method (CCLM).

We firstly adopt a part heatmap regression network to predict the landmark points on a local granularity by generating a series of heatmaps for each 3D landmark point. To enhance the ability of local feature representation, we incorporate the designed network with a part attention module, which transfers the convolution opereation into a channelwise attention opereation. Additionally, we take all these heatmaps alongside the input image as the input of another shape regression network in order to model the feature representations from local discrete regions to a global semantically continuous space. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, AFLW2000-3D, 300VW and the Menpo Benchmark, show the effectiveness of both the global consistency and local description in our model, and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.																			2473-9936		978-1-5386-1034-3				2017							2529	2536		10.1109/ICCVW.2017.297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2017.297													WOS:000425239602069

Inspired by Lyapunov's direct method on continuous-time systems, a class of discrete-time FCVNNs is further discussed by employing the fractional-order extension of Lyapunov's direct method. Firstly, by means of contraction mapping theory and Cauchy's inequality, a sufficient condition is presented to ascertain the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point for discrete-time FCVNNs. Then, based on the theory of discrete fractional calculus, discrete Laplace transform, the theory of complex functions and discrete Mittag-Leffler functions, a sufficient condition is established for global Mittag-Leffler stability of the proposed networks. Additionally, by applying the Lyapunov's direct method and designing a effective control scheme, the sufficient criterion is derived to ensure the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization of discrete-time FCVNNs. Finally, two numerical examples are also presented to manifest the feasibility and validity of the obtained results. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Application and performance analysis of neural networks for decision support in conceptual design	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												This paper analyzes the use of feedforward multilayer perceptron neural networks in the support of the decision process during the conceptual design phase of engineering systems. A user friendly software tool is proposed in order to increase the quality of the designers' decisions by offering intuitive insights during the early design phase. The performance gain is evaluated through controlled experiments performed with non-experienced users. This paper proposes using the prediction capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks to recommend design solutions based on earlier successful designs. It implements a feedforward multilayer perceptron architecture with sigmoid activation functions, and uses the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm for weight matrix update. The network complexity was abstracted to ease the utilization by non-expert users. Different stopping conditions were developed including one where the training and testing error divergence is monitored to tackle the bias/variance dilemma. The advantages of this approach for decision support were measured through a set of six different case studies such as gaseous automobile emissions prediction based on institutional data, or the choice of a launcher for a specific space mission. The decision support tool generated quality performance gains between 13% and 88% for examples ranging from simple continuous single variable to complex discrete multivariate problems.

Many experimental techniques such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements provide only limited discrete information at given points; especially, for the cases of complex flows such as dump combustor swirling flows. For this type of flow, usual numerical interpolating schemes appear to be unsuitable. Neural Network Analysis (ANN) is proposed and the results are presented in this paper and are compared with the experimental data used for training purposes. This pilot study showed that artificial neural network is an appropriate method for predicting swirl flow characteristics in a model of a dump combustor. These techniques are proposed for better designs and optimization of dump combustors.

The measure combines hydraulic and mechanical availability in a form that defines the proportion of the time that the system will satisfactorily fulfill its function. However, rather than a simple discrete failure relationship with absolute failure it pressure heads fall below a prescribed minimum the hydraulic availability is modeled with continuous increasing acceptability as higher pressures occur. Availability is considered in a nonlinear optimization model that is reduced in complexity by linking the optimizer with a network solver to implicitly solve the hydraulic constraints. The results of the model application show an increasing marginal cost for higher levels of availability, and the optimal designs tend to follow the engineering rules of thumb for system design.

Given a base network made up with two-way links, candidate link expansion projects, and candidate link construction projects, the problem determines the optimal combination of one-way and two-way links, the optimal selection of capacity expansion projects, and the optimal lane allocations on two-way links over a dual time scale. The problem considers both the total travel time and the total CO emissions as the two objective function measures. The problem is modelled using a time-dependent approach that considers a planning horizon of multiple years and both morning and evening peaks. Under this approach, the model allows determining the sequence of link construction, the expansion projects over a predetermined planning horizon, the configuration of street orientations, and the lane allocations for morning and evening peaks in each year of the planning horizon. This model is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem with mathematical equilibrium constraints. In this regard, two multi-objective metaheuristics, including a modified nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a multi-objective B-cell algorithm, are proposed to solve the above-mentioned problem. Computational results for various test networks are also presented in this paper.

It involves the determination of an efficient transportation network and the scheduling details of the corresponding services. Compared to vehicle routing problems, SNDP can model transfers and consolidations on a multi-modal freight network. The problem is often formulated as a mixed integer programming problem and is NP-Hard. In this research, we propose a new efficient large neighbourhood search function that can handle the constraints more efficiently. The effectiveness of this new neighbourhood is evaluated in a tabu search metaheuristic (TS) and a GLS guided local search (GLS) method. Experimental results based on a set of well-known benchmark instances show that the new neighbourhood performs significantly better than the previous arc-flipping neighbourhood. The neighbourhood function is also applicable in other optimisation problems with similar discrete constraints.

The CARS strategy aims to maximise the tracking performance of MRS, whilst minimising the interference from MRS to communication systems (CSs), whose mechanism is to simultaneously control the revisit frame interval of each target and determine the activation of radar nodes, the radar-target assignment and the allocation of transmitted power. Mathematically, the CARS strategy is formulated as an optimization problem, which contains both the continuous variable and the discrete (integer) variable. To tackle the resultant mixed-integer, non-convex, and non-linear problem efficiently, incorporating with the proposed hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, a two-stage solution technique is developed to obtain the near-optimal solution. Numerical simulation results are provided to validate the proposed CARS strategy and demonstrate its superiority over the traditional scheduling strategies.																			1751-9675	1751-9683				SEP	2022	16	7			SI		750	761		10.1049/sil2.12097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/sil2.12097		JAN 2022											WOS:000740184100001

Continuous-time scheduling formulation for straight pipelines	AICHE JOURNAL												Pipelines represent the most cost-effective way of transporting large quantities of refined petroleum products over large distances but can be challenging to operate. In this article, we propose a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for scheduling straight pipelines with multiple single and dual purpose nodes. The model allows for simultaneous injections and deliveries, and interacting pumping runs, in which a segment of the pipeline simultaneously receives material from its refinery and upstream segment. In contrast to previous batch centric models, it uses segment dependent coordinates. To make it efficient by design, we rely on generalized disjunctive programming and develop disjunctions for which the convex hull reformulation is simple (roughly the same number of variables and constraints as its big-M counterpart). Through the solution of a set of test cases from the literature, we show a better utilization of the pipeline capacity that is translated into a lower makespan.

To maximally enhance the energy efficiency (EE) of hybrid precoding under this structure, the joint optimization of switch-controlled connections and the hybrid precoders is formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer non-convex problem with high-dimensional power constraints. To efficiently solve such a challenging problem, we first decouple it into a continuous hybrid precoding (CHP) subproblem. Then, with the hybrid precoders obtained from the CHP subproblem, the original problem can be equivalently reformulated as a discrete connection-state (DCS) problem with only 0-1 integer variables. For the CHP subproblem, we propose an alternating hybrid precoding (AHP) algorithm. Then, with the hybrid precoders provided by the AHP algorithm, we develop a matching assisted fully-adaptive hybrid precoding (MA-FAHP) algorithm to solve the DCS problem. It is theoretically shown that the proposed MA-FAHP algorithm always converges to a stable solution with the polynomial complexity. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MA-FAHP algorithm in terms of EE and beampattern.

Parameterized reinforcement learning for optical system optimization	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS												Engineering a physical system to feature designated characteristics states an inverse design problem, which is often determined by several discrete and continuous parameters. If such a system must feature a particular behavior, the mentioned combination of both, discrete and continuous, parameters results in a challenging optimization problem that requires an extensive search for an optimal system design. However, if the corresponding inverse design problem can be reformulated as a parameterized Markov decision process, reinforcement learning (RL) provides a heuristic framework to solve it. In this work, we use multi-layer thin films as an example of the aforementioned optimization problems and consider three design parameters: Each of the thin film layer's dielectric material (discrete) and thickness (continuous), as well as the total number of layers (discrete). While recent methods merely determine the optimal thicknesses and-less commonly-the layers' materials, our approach optimizes the total number of stacked layers as well. In summary, we further develop a Q-learning variant to solve inverse design optimization and thereby outperform human experts and current approaches like needle-point optimization or naive RL. For this purpose, we propose an exponentially transformed reward signal that eases policy search and enables constrained optimization. Moreover, the learned Q-values contain information about the optical properties of multi-layer thin films, which allows us a physical interpretation or what-if analysis and thus enables explainability.

Using <i>l</i><SUP>p</SUP>-norms for fairness in combinatorial optimisation	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												The issue of fairness has received attention from researchers in many fields, including combinatorial optimisation. One way to drive the solution toward fairness is to use a modified objective function that involves so-called l(P)-norms. If done in a naive way, this approach leads to large and symmetric mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs), that may be difficult to solve. We show that, for some problems, one can obtain alternative MINLP formulations that are much smaller, do not suffer from symmetry, and have a reasonably tight continuous relaxation. We give encouraging computational results for certain vehicle routing, facility location and network design problems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Specifically, the deception attacks are considered in the filter, where the adversary attempts to inject some false information data in the measurement output to modify the transmitted signal in the communication networks. We introduce, respectively, two sets of stochastic variables satisfying the Bernoulli distribution to depict the probability of the data transmitted by the network being subjected to time-varying coupling delays and deception attacks. By using Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory and Abel lemma-based finite-sum inequality, a new set of sufficient conditions is established, which ensures the stochastic stability of the resulting error system with a prescribed mixed H-infinity and passivity performance index. The proposed filter parameters are obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities. Ultimately, both the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed asynchronous filter with deception attacks are verified by two numerical examples including a tunnel diode circuit model.

However, there are fewer studies on multi-robot deep reinforcement learning based on parameterized action spaces. Cooperative decision-making for soccer robots is the representative task for studying it. In this paper, the reward function is desired to guide the learning of cooperative offensive for soccer robots. Hence, the shooting angle reward is designed to improve the scoring rate based on the basic reward function. Moreover, a MADDPG network structure based on bi-channel Q-value estimation (BI-MAPDDPG) is proposed. Two channels of Critic network with the discrete action weight deal with coupling between the discrete action and continuous action parameters well. Finally, simulation results show that soccer robots' cooperative offensive decision-making based on BI-MAPDDPG is robust and scalable.

Finite-time event-triggered non-fragile state estimation for discrete-time delayed neural networks with randomly occurring sensor nonlinearity and energy constraints	NEUROCOMPUTING												In this paper, the problem of event-triggered non-fragile state estimator design for discrete-time delayed neural networks (DNNs) is investigated over finite-time span. In consideration of the changes of environment and high sensitivity, external disturbances and/or parameter uncertainties might be involved in estimator parameters of the concerned DNNs. Therefore, it is one of our main objectives to design a non-fragile state estimator subject to the norm bounded gain variation. The sensor nonlinearity is supposed to occur in a random way. In the meanwhile, the event-triggered scheme and energy constraints are adopted in state estimator design for the purpose of energy and resource saving. By using the Lyapunov stability theory and some analytical techniques, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the estimation error system is finite-time bounded and meet a prescribed mixed H-infinity and passivity performance constraint. Furthermore, the estimator gains are obtained via solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, two numerical examples are exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technique. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It can be launched without compromising any legitimate node or cryptographic mechanisms, and often serves as a stepping stone for many serious attacks. Most existing countermeasures often make critical assumptions or require specialized hardware devices in the network. Those assumptions and requirements limit the applicability of previous approaches. In this work, we explore the impact of wormhole attacks on network connectivity topologies, and develop a simple distributed method to detect wormholes, called WormCircle. WormCircle relies solely on local connectivity information without any requirements on special hardware devices or making any rigorous assumptions on network properties. We establish the correctness of this design in continuous geometric domains and extend it into discrete networks. We evaluate the effectiveness in randomly deployed sensor networks through extensive simulations.

By choosing two discontinuous piecewise linear functions and employing the convex combination method, several algebraic criteria are demonstrated to achieve globally asymptotic stabilization of NTNNs with constant and unbounded time-varying delays. First, the asymptotic stability theorem for timescale-type systems is constructed by utilizing the timescale theory. Based on this asymptotic stability theorem, an impulsive control scheme is designed to guarantee global asymptotic stabilization of NTNNs with constant delay. Second, we propose several impulsive control schemes to achieve globally asymptotic stabilization of NTNNs with unbounded delay by virtue of the comparison strategy. Globally asymptotic stabilization criteria for NTNNs include the theoretical results of continuous-time neural networks (NNs), their discrete-time forms and NNs on continuous-discrete hybrid time scales. Especially, impulsive control for globally asymptotic stabilization of NTNNs with proportional delay is demonstrated without any variable transformation. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed theoretical results is verified by four numerical examples.

However, conventional nature-inspired optimization algorithms encounter serious challenges and difficulties when used directly to seek communities in networks, due to the large amount of data and the NP hard combinatorial nature of the problem. Thus in this paper, we introduce a novel bacterial foraging optimization approach to uncovering community structure in networks. Instead of using the original bacterial foraging designed traditionally for continuous optimization, the problem of community detection is exquisitely embedded into a redefined discrete framework. The evolutionary principles for the bacterial foraging are developed from a topological perspective. Furthermore, two specific local updating rules, namely the greedy strategy and the stochastic strategy, are designed to steer the swarm of bacteria to the favored regions. The extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world networks indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline algorithms and can achieve a high accuracy on the uncovered community structure. The integration of the proposed approach into the analysis of power grids and its explicit utility are also discussed in detail, showing that our method has high accuracy and practicability.

It is assumed that only the measured output can be utilized to design the controller. Quantized output controllers (QOCs) are considered to save the bits rate of communication channels and the bandwidth. The main difficulty in solving this problem is to cope with the neutral terms, the delays, and the uncertainties induced by the quantization simultaneously. By designing new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and proposing novel analytical techniques, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the exponential synchronization of the interested NTNNs. The control gains are given by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are not necessarily to be negative-definite matrices.

Firstly, a model of the directed state coupled RD NNs is introduced, which not only contains some discrete and distributed time delays, but also obeys a mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition. Secondly, a spacial sampled-data controller is proposed to achieve the HOS of the considered networks. This type of controller can reduce the update rate in the process of control by measuring the state of networks at some fixed sampling points in the space region. Moreover, some criteria for the HOS are established by designing an appropriate Lyapunov functional, and some quantitative relations between diffusion coefficients, mixed delays, coupling strength and control parameters are given accurately by these criteria. Thirdly, the case of directed spatial diffusion coupled networks is also studied and, the following finding is obtained: the spatial diffusion coupling can suppress the HOS while the state coupling can promote it. Finally, one example is simulated as the verification of the theoretical results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We introduce a double -layered multiagent network, in which each agent only has access to partial information of matrices A , B and F , to solve these two subproblems in a distributed structure. Subsequently, we develop continuous -time and discrete -time distributed algorithms to obtain an LS solution of AXB = F . In particular, the sufficient and necessary conditions about the step -sizes are established, under which the discrete -time algorithm can linearly converge to an LS solution. Compared with the previous results in which each agent needs to communicate multiple matrix variables with the neighbors, the proposed algorithms effectively reduce communication burden for each agent since only one matrix variable is communicated in the upper -layer network and the communication variables in the lower -layered network are vectors with lower dimensions than matrices. Finally, an application example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A GENERALIZED MIXED HYBRID MORTAR METHOD FOR SOLVING FLOW IN STOCHASTIC DISCRETE FRACTURE NETWORKS	SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING												The simulation of flow in fractured media requires handling both a large number of fractures and a complex interconnecting network of these fractures. Networks considered in this paper are three-dimensional domains made up of two-dimensional fractures intersecting each other and randomly generated. Due to the stochastic generation of fractures, intersections can be highly intricate. The numerical method must generate a mesh and define a discrete problem for any discrete fracture network (DFN). A first approach [Erhel, de Dreuzy, and Poirriez, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 31 (2009), pp. 2688-2705] is to generate a conforming mesh and to apply a mixed hybrid finite element method. However, the resulting linear system becomes very large when the network contains many fractures. Hence a second approach [Pichot, Erhel, and de Dreuzy, Appl. Anal., 89 (2010), pp. 1629-1643] is to generate a nonconforming mesh, using an independent mesh generation for each fracture. Then a Mortar technique applied to the mixed hybrid finite element method deals with the nonmatching grids. When intersections do not cross or overlap, pairwise Mortar relations for each intersection are efficient [Pichot, Erhel, and de Dreuzy, 2010]. But for most random networks, discretized intersections involve more than two fractures. In this paper, we design a new method generalizing the previous one and that is applicable for stochastic networks. The main idea is to combine pairwise Mortar relations with additional relations for the overlapping part. This method still ensures the continuity of fluxes and heads and still yields a symmetric positive definite linear system. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of the method applied to complex stochastic fracture networks. We also study numerical convergence when reducing the mesh step. This method makes it easy to perform mesh optimization and appears to be a very promising tool to simulate flow in multiscale fracture networks.					de Dreuzy, Jean-Raynald/B-1417-2012; Expériences, Modélisation/A-2664-2013	de Dreuzy, Jean-Raynald/0000-0003-2993-2015													1064-8275	1095-7197					2012	34	1					B86	B105		10.1137/100804383	http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/100804383													WOS:000300937500026

Discrete-event piecewise affine (PWA) and discrete-event max-plus models are proposed to formulate the optimization problem for the switching sequences. Two control problems are considered: steady-state control and N-stages control. The formulated discrete-event PWA and max-plus problems are converted to be solved by linear programming (LP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In the special case when the criterion is a strictly monotonous and linear function of the queue lengths, the steady-state control problem is solved analytically.

Optimized planning of CLSC network is required and is influenced by uncertainties of recovery. So, this study seeks to establish a robust optimal model for CLSC network, considering both uncertainties in quantity and quality of returned products. After the general framework of CLSC is discussed, the measurements for uncertain quantity and quality of returned products are formulated mathematically, respectively as a number of discrete scenarios and Quality Index. A mixed integral linear programming (MILP) model for a CLSC network design is established and then translated into a robust optimization model based on regret value, to determine facilities' locations and quantity of flows between facilities in the network. A numerical example is given, and the simulation results show that the operation strategies of the CLSC are relatively stable under different recycling scenarios. Therefore, the optimization model for CLSC network has good robustness.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-030-37429-7; 978-3-030-37428-0				2019	11956						402	412		10.1007/978-3-030-37429-7_40	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37429-7_40													WOS:000655618500040

In this paper, a novel discretetime ZNN (DTZNN) model for time-varying matrix inversion is proposed and investigated. Specifically, a new numerical difference rule based on Taylor series expansion is established in this paper for first-order derivative approximation. Then, by exploiting this Taylor-type difference rule, the novel DTZNN model, which is a five-step iteration algorithm, is thus proposed for time-varying matrix inversion. Theoretical results are also presented for the proposed DTZNN model to show its excellent computational property. Comparative numerical results with three illustrative examples further substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed DTZNN model for time-varying matrix inversion compared with previous DTZNN models.

Their impact has been seen mainly in the computer vision field with realistic image and video manipulation, especially generation, making significant advancements. Although these computer vision advances have garnered much attention, GAN applications have diversified across disciplines such as time series and sequence generation. As a relatively new niche for GANs, fieldwork is ongoing to develop high-quality, diverse, and private time series data. In this article, we review GAN variants designed for time series related applications. We propose a classification of discrete-variant GANs and continuous-variant GANs, in which GANs deal with discrete time series and continuous time series data. Here we showcase the latest and most popular literature in this field-their architectures, results, and applications. We also provide a list of the most popular evaluation metrics and their suitability across applications. Also presented is a discussion of privacy measures for these GANs and further protections and directions for dealing with sensitive data.

The proposed model formulation and solution strategy are believed to be superior to the available ones in the following aspects. First, a continuous-time based time model is introduced and an improved state-space superstructure with SEN and STN representations is adopted to capture the structural characteristics of the integrated water-allocation network for batch process. Then, cost of splitters and mixers is added to reduce and evaluate the complexity of the network configuration. Finally, a hybrid optimization strategy integrating DICOPT and CA is developed for the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model and, also, an interactive iteration method is adopted based on sensitivity analysis to guide the search toward a potential global optimum.

A fuzzy sampled-data control strategy that takes into account the time-delay effect is designed to solve the synchronization problem of such networks. Synchronization criteria are established for complex networks with the target node by constructing a modified time-dependent Lyapunov functional and using a mathematical induction approach. In contrast to most existing results, the constructed Lyapunov functional is neither necessarily positive on sampling intervals nor needlessly continuous at sampling instants. Moreover, a corresponding greater aperiodic sampling interval is obtained. Numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed strategies.

The protocol, in addition to optimally minimizing the total energy consumption of all sensors over all rounds of data gathering, also balances the load on them. The algorithm works in polynomial time complexity and is completely centralized. However, it incurs less overhead as the data routing information is disseminated to all sensors only once at the network initialization.																					978-0-7695-2835-9				2007							71	+																WOS:000246988200013

The local reactive power control laws considered to solve this issue might lead to voltage instability. In this context, the current paper proposes a methodology to study voltage stability of a distribution feeder hosting distributed generation.

The stability of the system is assessed conducting a reachability analysis of the equivalent discrete abstraction. An illustrative application of the proposed approach to a real medium- voltage 124 buses network with a single distributed generator reveals unstable operating regions of the network and helps designing a measurement filter ensuring system stability without loss of rapidity.

While deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable results in temporal link prediction, most existing studies have focused on discrete model frameworks. These frameworks face limitations in capturing deep structural features and effectively aggregating temporal information. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from neural differential equations to propose a Continuous Temporal Graph Neural Differential Equation (CTGNDE) network model for temporal link prediction. Specifically, we design a spatial graph Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to capture the spatial correlations inherent in complex spatiotemporal information. Then we employ Neural Controlled Differential Equation (Neural CDE) to learn complex evolution patterns and effectively aggregate temporal information. Finally, we characterize completely continuous and more accurate hidden state trajectories by coupling spatial and temporal messages. Experiments conducted on 10 real -world network datasets validated the superior performance of the CTGNDE model over the state-of-the-art baselines.

Introduced ZNN dynamical design is termed as ZNN models of the order p, p >= 2, and it is based on the analogy between the proposed continuous-time dynamical systems and underlying discrete-time pth order hyperpower iterative methods for computing the constant matrix inverse. Such ZNN design is denoted by ZNN(H)(p). Particularly, the ZNN(H)(2) design coincides with the standard ZNN design. Moreover, ZNN(H)(3) design represents a time-varying generalization of the previously defined ZNNCM model. In addition, an integration-enhanced noise-handling ZNN(H)(p) model, termed as IENHZNN(H)(p) H, is introduced. In the time-invariant case, we present a hybrid enhancement of the ZNN(H)(p) model, shortly termed as HZNN(H)(p), and investigate it theoretically and numerically.

To overcome these challenges, a discontinuous event-trigger (DET) scheme, consisting of the rest interval and work interval, is proposed to cut down the triggering times and save the limited communication resources. Then, a novel relaxed piecewise functional is constructed for closed-loop MNNs. The main advantage of the designed functional consists in that it is positive definite only in the work intervals and the sampling instants but not necessarily inside the rest intervals. With the aid of extended reciprocally convex combination lemma, generalized sector condition, and some inequality techniques, two local stabilization criteria are established on the basis of both the discrete- and continuous-time Lyapunov methods. The proposed analysis technique fully takes advantage of the looped-functional and the event-trigger mechanism. Moreover, two optimization schemes are, respectively, established to design the control gain and enlarge the estimates of the admissible initial conditions (AICs) and the upper bound of rest intervals. Finally, some comparison results are given to validate the superiority of the proposed method.					zhen, wang/KBA-3844-2024; Huang, Xia/AFL-8711-2022; Xia, Jianwei/ABD-8057-2021; Zhao, ZiHao/KHT-4413-2024; shen, hao/HGF-0551-2022; Wang, Zhen/AAF-8133-2019	Huang, Xia/0000-0002-4955-8318; , Hao/0000-0001-7024-6573; Wang, Zhen/0000-0001-7188-5828													2162-237X	2162-2388				APR	2023	34	4					1988	2000		10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3105731	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3105731		AUG 2021						34464276					WOS:000732181800001

Our synchronization criteria are easily verified and do not need to solve any linear matrix inequality. These results generalize a few previous known results and remove some restrictions on amplification function and time delay. This research also demonstrates the effectiveness of application in secure communication. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the main results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this problem, one of the two available technologies can be installed on each edge and all customers of the network need to be served by at least the lower level (secondary) technology. The decision maker is confronted with uncertainty regarding the set of primary customers, i.e., the set of nodes that need to be served by the higher level (primary) technology. A set of discrete scenarios associated with the possible realizations of primary customers is available. The network is built in two stages. In the first stage the network topology must be determined. One may decide to install the primary technology on some of the edges in the first stage, or one can wait to see which scenario will be realized, in which case, edges with the installed secondary technology may be upgraded, if necessary to primary technology, but at higher recovery cost. The overall goal then is to build a "recoverable robust" spanning tree in the first stage that serves all customers by at least the lower level technology, and that minimizes the first-stage installation cost plus the worst-case cost needed to upgrade the edges of the selected tree, so that the primary customers of each scenario can be served using the primary technology. We discuss the complexity of the problem, provide mixed-integer programming models, and develop a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve it. Our extensive computational experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

By constructing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing Newton-Leibniz formulation and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, a delay-interval-dependent condition is developed to estimate the neuron state with some available output measurements such that the error-state system is global asymptotically stable. Two examples are given to show the effectiveness and decreased conservatism of the proposed criterion in comparison with some existing results.

Based on a multiperiod hyperstructure network representation, explicit structural controllability (total disturbance rejection) criteria are developed and included within a synthesis/retrofit mixed-integer nonlinear programming model, where a total annualized (operating and investment) cost is minimized. The proposed framework results in a network structure which features minimum annualized cost, while being (i) flexible to operate within a specified range (or discrete set) of uncertain stream flow rates, inlet temperatures, and/or heat transfer coefficients and (ii) structurally controllable for a given set of disturbances and control variables.

Our aim is to design a Luenberger-type filter for estimating information about the neuron states, which is required in some applied areas. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and using the Wirtinger-based integral inequality to estimate its derivative, a delay-range-dependent and delay-rate-dependent criterion is presented to ensure the augmented filtering dynamic system to be robustly exponentially stable and passive with an expected dissipation. Since the criterion is presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities with nonlinear constraints, a cone complementarity linearization algorithm is proposed to determine the filter gain from solution to the nonlinear problem.

We construct the space-time travel network and formulate the assignment model by destination-based arc flow variables, then design a Dantzig-Wolfe (D-W) decomposition-based algorithm to solve the large-scale model of this problem with less memory requirement and computational complexity. The sub-problem in each iteration can be solved as a single-source (destination) minimum cost flow problem without capacity constraint by the "rooftops" method, which provides an effective technique to tackle both continuous and discrete time-varying demand in the assignment problem. It is further demonstrated that the assignment solutions for discrete time-varying demand can converge to that for continuous time-varying demand with the increase of demand discretization number. Three real case studies with different HSR network scales show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in memory and computational complexity, especially when highly accurate solutions for passenger assignment on large-scale HSR networks are needed.

We describe centralize and hierarchical control frameworks for reducing power consumption in backbone computer networks. The implementation of these frameworks provides the local control mechanisms that are implemented in the network devices level and network-wide control strategies implemented in the central control level. In this paper, we focus on network-wide algorithms for calculating the power status of network devices and the energy-aware MPLS routing for recommended network configuration. We enumerate several possible formulations of a network energy saving optimization problem with continuous and discrete variables. We discuss the limitations of these approaches and problems with their application to power control in real networks. We propose the relaxation of the complete binary problem formulation assuming full routing and energy state of all devices calculation, and the algorithm to solve it. Our formulation is based on a heuristic approach that leads to a continuous optimization. The evaluation of the optimization scheme through simulation is presented in the final part of the paper.

The objective function considered is the total weight (or cost) of the structure subjected to serviceability and strength requirements as specified by the American Institute for Steel Construction (AISC) Load and Resistance Factor Design, 2001. The design of steel frames is mapped into a modified traveling salesman problem (TSP) where the configuration of the TSP network reflects the structural topology, and the resulting length of the TSP tour corresponds to the weight of the frame. The number of potential paths between nodes in the TSP network represents all (or a portion) of the available W-shapes in the AISC database. The resulting frame, mapped into a TSP, is minimized using an ACO algorithm with a penalty function to enforce strength and serviceability constraints. A comparison is presented between the ACO frame designs and designs developed using a genetic algorithm and classical continuous optimization methods.

Design methods are given for distributed synchronization control of continuous and discrete-time multi-agent systems on directed communication graphs. The graph properties complicate the design of synchronization controllers due to an interplay between the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix and the required stabilizing gains. Methods given herein are based on computation of the local control gains using Riccati design. Conditions are given for synchronization relying on relation of the graph Laplacian eigenvalues to a region in the complex plane that depends on agent dynamics and Riccati solutions. Distributed observers for agents networked on a directed graph are also investigated. Cooperative observer design guaranteeing convergence of estimates of all agents to their actual states is proposed. It is shown that the discrete-time synchronizing region is inherently bounded, so that the conditions for observer convergence and state synchronization are stricter than results for their continuous-time counterparts. If outputs only are available for control the distributed static output-feedback (OPFB) control can be used. The synchronizing region for static OPFB control is exposed and found to be conical, different than the infinite right-half plane synchronizing region for distributed state-feedback. Furthermore, the multi-agent system synchronization with control signal delays is presented. Agents are assumed to have the same control delay. Delay-dependent synchronizing region is defined and methods are given guaranteeing its estimates.

J	Saglam, Ü; Banerjee, A				Saglam, Umit; Banerjee, Avijit			Integrated multiproduct batch production and truck shipment scheduling under different shipping policies	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												The classical economic lot-scheduling problem (ELSP) involves the batch sizing and scheduling of multiple products in a single facility under deterministic conditions over an infinite planning horizon. It is assumed that the products are delivered to customers at continuous rates. In today's supply chains, however, often employing complex delivery networks, the finished goods are usually transported in discrete lots to succeeding stages along the distribution process, in order to take advantage of economies of scale in transportation. In this paper, we formulate mathematical models that attempt to integrate the production lot scheduling problem with outbound shipment decisions. The optimization objective is to minimize the total relevant costs of a manufacturer, which distributes a set of products to multiple retailers. In making the production/distribution decisions, the common cycle approach is employed to solve the ELSP, for simplicity. Two different shipping scenarios, i.e. periodic full truckload (TL) peddling shipments and less than truckload (LTL) direct shipping, are integrated with and linked to the multiproduct batching decisions. We consider these two shipment policies for both coordinated and uncoordinated scenarios. The resulting mixed-integer, non-linear programming models (MINLPs) are solved by the BONMIN solver. Finally, a set of numerical examples illustrate and evaluate the relative efficacies of these policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Building upon recent approaches for the design of reliable control surrogates with guaranteed structural properties, we develop a systematic procedure to certify the closed-loop stability and performance of a linear uncertain system when a trained rectified linear unit (ReLU)-based approximation replaces such traditional controllers. First, we provide a sufficient condition, which involves the worst-case approximation error between ReLU-based and traditional controller-based state-to-input mappings, ensuring that the system is ultimately bounded within a set with adjustable size and convergence rate. Then, we develop an offline, mixed-integer optimization-based method that allows us to compute that quantity exactly.

To save communication resources and reduce control cost, quantized controllers, which only work on continuous-time intervals, are designed. Owing to the hybrid characteristics of continuous- and discrete-time subsystems, existing finite-time stability theorems are not applicable. By developing novel analytical techniques, three criteria are derived to guarantee the finite-time synchronization. Moreover, the settling time is explicitly estimated. It is shown that the settling time is dependent not only on the control gains and systems' initial conditions, but also on the control width and uncontrolled width. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.					, Xinsong/O-1510-2016	, Xinsong/0000-0003-3599-5020													1674-733X	1869-1919				JUN 19	2020	63	9							192201	10.1007/s11432-018-2727-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-018-2727-5													WOS:000543233100001

However, these subnetworks should evolve over time in response to the growing AV demand, which necessitates a multi-stage modeling approach. In this study, we propose multi-stage deployment of AV-ready subnetworks and formulate it as a time-dependent network design problem, which is a bi-level mixed-integer programming problem. The lower level is a simultaneous travel mode and route choice equilibrium with continuous decision variables, and the upper level is a design problem including infrastructure investment decisions to determine which roads to upgrade and include in AV-ready subnetworks for mixed traffic. We use a case study of a real road network to demonstrate the concept. Since computational efficiency is a key factor for solving such large-scale problems, we develop two efficient and tailored evolutionary heuristics to solve the problem, and compare their performance to a computationally demanding Genetic-algorithm-based solution method. The results indicate that the proposed algorithms can efficiently solve this large-scale problem while satisfying constraints in all scenarios, and outperform Genetic algorithm, particularly in the scenario with larger number of stages. Moreover, in all scenarios, deployment of AV-ready subnetworks leads to improvements in network performance in terms of total travel time and cost. However, the improvements are always accompanied with increased total travel distance. The extent of changes depends on AV market penetration rate, AV-ready subnetwork density and timing of densification.						van Arem, Bart/0000-0001-8316-7794; Snelder, Maaike/0000-0001-7766-2174; van Nes, Rob/0000-0003-1022-9661; Madadi, Bahman/0000-0002-7130-8825													0305-0548	1873-765X				DEC	2021	136								105483	10.1016/j.cor.2021.105483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2021.105483		JUL 2021											WOS:000693669100018

In practical applications, there are many discrete multi-objective optimization problems. The solution of different problems needs to design different evolutionary multi-objective algorithms according to their specific conditions. The threshold in the traditional multi-objective optimization of wireless network is a preset constant. It has relatively poor performance in the synthesis of images with different noise levels. An adaptive wireless network multi-objective optimization algorithm based on image synthesis is proposed. Based on the maximum inter class variance and maximum peak signal to noise ratio (SNR), an adaptive wireless network multi-objective optimization algorithm is established.

Reserve capacity is identified by the largest multiplier applied to a given existing demand matrix, that can be allocated to a network without violating the arc capacities. Having a two-way streets base network and the allowable street lane additions, the problem is to find the optimum configuration of street directions and two-way street lane allocations, and the optimum selection of street lane addition projects, in a way that the reserve capacity of the network is maximized. The problem is considered in two variations: in the first variation no restriction is imposed on the symmetricity of lane allocations for two-way streets, and in the second variation, two-way street lane allocations are restricted to be symmetric. The proposed problems are modeled as mixed-integer bi-level mathematical problems. A hybrid genetic algorithm and an evolutionary simulated annealing algorithm are proposed to solve the models. Computational results for both problem variations are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Minimizing the risks and the total cost of forestry supply chain network is the objective of this study. The lower semi-variance is used to measure the risks. The total cost is composed of variable cost, fixed cost, and transportation cost. Different from previous literature, an approximation method is put forward to convert a continuous fuzzy issue into discrete fuzzy issue and method of auxiliary variable is introduced to transform multi-objective problem into single-objective problem. Cplex 12.6 is used to deal with this problem. The results arc as follows. First, this model can be well solved by Cplex 12.6. Second, the structure of forestry-paper supply chain network keeps unchanged with the increase of discretization points. Third, the lower semi-variance and expected value of total cost converge with the increase of discretization points.																					978-1-4799-1717-4				2015							146	150																WOS:000380441000026

First, a one-layer projection neural network is designed based on a projection operator and a projection matrix. The stability and global convergence of the proposed neural network are proved. Then, based on a discrete-time version of the PNN, several L-1-minimization algorithms for sparse signal reconstruction are developed and analyzed. Experimental results based on random Gaussian sparse signals show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithms.

This can, however, negatively impact other aspects of network performance, such as leakage management. In this article, we consider the design-for-control (DfC) problem of adding new connections (from a predefined set of candidate pipes) to water supply systems to improve their resilience to failure events while minimizing the impact on leakage management under normal operating conditions. We present a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation of the problem of optimal link addition for the minimization of average zone pressure (AZP), a surrogate measure of pressure dependent leakage. We implement a method based on spatial branch-and-bound to solve the problem on a case study network from the literature and an operational network part of an urban water system in the U.K. Finally, we validate the improvement in network resilience resulting from the addition of new connections by performing an a posteriori critical link analysis, using the hydraulic resilience measure of reserve capacity.

The mixed delays include constant delay in the leakage term, discrete and distributed delays. The discrete delays are assumed to be time-varying and belong to a given interval, which means that the lower and upper bounds of interval time-varying delays are available. By using Lyapunov stability theory, stochastic analysis, linear matrix inequality techniques and introducing some free-weighting matrices, several novel sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the passivity of the suggested system in the sense of mean square under two cases: with known or unknown parameters. It is believed that these results are significant and useful for the design and applications of impulsive stochastic neural networks. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

The method involves designing a neural network observer for partially unknown nonlinear systems with sampled and delayed outputs, using a radial basis function (RBF) neural network to approximate the system's unknown part. A new weight update algorithm is proposed, along with a closed-loop output predictor for coping with variable samples, and a closed-loop integral compensation to handle variable delay.

Though extensively studied in recent years, the practical limitations of RIS are often neglected when assessing the performance of RIS-assisted communication networks. One of these limitations is that each RIS element is restricted to incur a controllable phase shift to the reflected signal from a predefined discrete set. This paper studies an RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an RIS with discrete phase shifts assists in simultaneous uplink data transmission from multiple user equipments (UEs) to a base station (BS). We aim to maximize the sum rate by optimizing the receive beamforming vectors and RIS phase shift configuration. To this end, we transform the original sum-rate maximization problem into a minimum mean square error (MMSE) minimization problem and employ the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique for iterative optimization of the variables until convergence. We formulate the discrete RIS phase shift optimization problem as a mixed-integer least squares problem and propose a novel method based on sphere decoding (SD) to solve it. Through numerical evaluation, we show that the proposed discrete phase shift design outperforms the conventional nearest point mapping method, which is prevalently used in previous works.

A consolidation terminal typically acts as a hub in an express service network where packages from a number of service centers are combined, mixed, sorted, and transshipped for local deliveries. Initially, the design of an express service network is determined by considering the amount of initial investments and operating costs for terminals and service centers within the network. Therefore, continuous modifications of network design are required to adjust to rapidly changing business environments. This study suggests an approach to the reconfiguration of an express courier service network with respect to assignments of service centers to consolidation terminals and adjustments of their cutoff times. We propose an integer programming model and a genetic algorithm based solution procedure for allowing express couriers to maximize their incremental profit. An illustrative numerical example with reduced data sets from an express courier in Korea is presented to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the proposed model and its solution procedure.																			1349-4198	1349-418X				JAN	2010	6	1			SI		335	347																WOS:000273648900029

The mixed time-varying delays lie in not only state but the switching information, which increases the difficulty of designing controller. An event-triggered mechanism is adopted in the paper, which can reduce communication resources and save the cost. Different from the triggering conditions expressed as quadratic forms in previous results, a mode-dependent linear form triggering condition is given, which is more efficient to resolve the positive stabilization problem. With the aid of a copositive type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the average dwell time approach, a desired delay controller by means of a linear programming method is designed to guarantee the positivity and exponential stability of the event-triggered control closed loop system. Finally, the validity of our main results is demonstrated by a simulation example.

J	Henson, R; Essex, S				Henson, R; Essex, S			The development, design and evaluation of sustainable local transport networks	INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL												This paper is about the relationship between urban areas and transport, particularly the design and evaluation of sustainable local transport networks. It is presented in the context of the changes in thinking associated with new ideas for traffic engineering in the urban environment, to accommodate the complex mix of activities arising on highway networks, which are now taken into account by decision-makers; ways by which urban planning can help to bring about greater use of sustainable transport modes; the growing influence of architects and urban designers on street pattern and road layout in modern British housing schemes. After reviewing the history of urban form and the theories that have guided various trends in design, the paper comments on developments and identifies the shortcomings of lower densities and inflexible networks, particularly with regard to reinforcing the reliance on a single, unsustainable transport mode. More recent trends in the design of urban areas in Britain are noted: more continuous street patterns; a less rigid application of the simple road hierarchy; a more equal treatment of the different transport modes. As design ideas develop the need to appraise transport networks arises in parallel. The final section identifies a range of techniques for analysing networks. The paper concludes by noting that sustainable travel systems can be encouraged by increasing urban densities and ensuring that street networks are designed to favour the more environmentally sound modes. To achieve this, there needs to be an emphasis on the measurement of the performance of street networks. Quantitative appraisal techniques will become an essential part of urban planning in the future.																			0020-8701					JUN	2003	55	176					219	+		10.1111/1468-2451.5502004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-2451.5502004													WOS:000185226800004

The complexity of such systems makes the design very challenging and demands for advanced validation techniques. Hybrid automata are a clean and consolidated formal language for modeling embedded systems which include discrete and continuous dynamics. They are based on a finite-state automaton structure enriched with invariant and flow conditions to model the continuous dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new language, HYDI, for modeling Hybrid systems with Discrete Interaction. The purpose of the language is to apply state-of-the-art symbolic model checkers for infinite-state systems to the verification of complex embedded systems design. HYDI extends the standard symbolic language SMV with timing and synchronization aspects. The language distinguishes between discrete and continuous variables. Variables inside SMV modules evolve synchronously. Top-level modules represent the asynchronous components of a network and use explicit events to synchronize. The new language is automatically compiled into equivalent discrete-time infinite-state transition systems.

Recently, beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) have been proposed as novel RIS architectures whose scattering matrix is not limited to being diagonal. However, BD-RISs have been studied assuming continuous-value scattering matrices, which are hard to implement in practice. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing two solutions to realize discrete-value group and fully connected RISs. First, we propose scalar-discrete RISs, in which each entry of the RIS impedance matrix is independently discretized. Second, we propose vector-discrete RISs, where the entries in each group of the RIS impedance matrix are jointly discretized. In both solutions, the codebook is designed offline such as to minimize the distortion caused in the RIS impedance matrix by the discretization operation. Numerical results show that vector-discrete RISs achieve higher performance than scalar-discrete RISs at the cost of increased optimization complexity. Furthermore, fewer resolution bits per impedance are necessary to achieve the performance upper bound as the group size of the group connected architecture increases. In particular, only a single resolution bit is sufficient in fully connected RISs to approximately achieve the performance upper bound.

The DBN uses a hidden garbage variable as well as the concept of switching parents to discriminate between keywords and arbitrary speech. Contextual information is incorporated by a BLSTM network, providing a discrete phoneme prediction feature for the DBN. Together with continuous acoustic features, the discrete BLSTM output is processed by the DBN which detects keywords. Due to the flexible design of our Tandem BLSTM-DBN recognizer, new keywords can be added to the vocabulary without having to re-train the model. Further, our concept does not require the training of an explicit garbage model.

Metal-phenolic network (MPN), a hydrophilic thin layer such as tannic acid (TA)-FeIII network, has been recently used to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs to improve their bioavailability. However, it remains challenging to synthesize nanocapsules of a wide variety of hydrophobic drugs and to scale up the production in a continuous manner. Here, we present a microfluidic synthesis method to continuously produce TA-FeIII network nanocapsules of hydrophobic drugs. We hypothesize that nanocapsules can continuously be formed only when the microfluidic mixing timescale is shorter than the drug's nucleation timescale. The hypothesis was tested on three hydrophobic drugs - paclitaxel, curcumin, and vitamin D with varying solubility and nucleation timescale. The proposed mechanism was validated by successfully predicting the synthesis outcomes. The microfluidically-synthesized nanocapsules had wellcontrolled sizes of 100-200 nm, high drug loadings of 40-70%, and a throughput of up to 70 mg hr-1 per channel. The release kinetics, cellular uptake, and cytotoxicity were further evaluated. The effect of coating constituents on nanocapsule properties were characterized.

J	Berber, S; Chen, N				Berber, Stevan; Chen, Nuo			Physical Layer Design in Wireless Sensor Networks for Fading Mitigation	JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS												This paper presents the theoretical analysis, simulation results and suggests design in digital technology of a physical layer for wireless sensor networks. The proposed design is able to mitigate fading inside communication channel. To mitigate fading the chip interleaving technique is proposed. For the proposed theoretical model of physical layer, a rigorous mathematical analysis is conducted, where all signals are presented and processed in discrete time domain form which is suitable for further direct processing necessary for devices design in digital technology. Three different channels are used to investigate characteristics of the physical layer: additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN), AWG noise and flat fading channel and AWG noise and flat fading channel with interleaver and deinterleaver blocks in the receiver and transmitter respectively. Firstly, the mathematical model of communication system representing physical layer is developed based on the discrete time domain signal representation and processing. In the existing theory, these signals and their processing are represented in continuous time form, which is not suitable for direct implementation in digital technology. Secondly, the expressions for the probability of chip, symbol and bit error are derived. Thirdly, the communication system simulators are developed in MATLAB. The simulation results confirmed theoretical findings.

These tools tend to handle some important CPS characteristics implicitly, such as network communication handshakes. At the same time, formal verification although a powerful approach, is still decoupled to FMI co-simulation processes, as it can easily lead to infeasible explorations due to state space explosion of continuous or discrete representations. In this paper we exploit co modelling and co-simulation concepts combined with the injection of formal verification results indirectly in a model-based design workflow that will enable verification engineering benefits in a heterogeneous, multidisciplinary design process for CPSs. We demonstrate the approach using a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) case study where communication delays may affect the CPS system's analysis. We model discrete events based on the Vienna Development Method Real-Time dialect, Continuous Time phenomena using Modelica, and communications using PROMELA. Results are considered and inspected both at the level of constituent models and the overall co-simulation.

The networks considered are called locally recurrent globally feed-forward, because they are designed with dynamic neuron models which contain inner feedbacks, but interconnections between neurons are strict feed-forward ones like in the well-known multi-layer perceptron. The paper presents analytical results showing that a locally recurrent network with two hidden layers is able to approximate a state-space trajectory produced by any Lipschitz continuous function with arbitrary accuracy. Moreover, based on these results, the network can be simplified and transformed into a more practical structure needed in real world applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, we propose a new model of MMAMNNs with mixed time-varying delays. In the proposed approach, the mixed delays include time-varying discrete delays and distributed time delays. Second, we design two kinds of hybrid controllers. Traditional control methods lack the capability of reflecting variable synaptic weights. In this paper, the controllers are carefully designed to confirm the process of different types of synchronization in the MMAMNNs.

The model studied in this paper is designed as an interconnection topology, and the main consideration is the connection mode of the undirected graph. In order to ensure the online sharing of learning knowledge, this paper proposes a novel weight update scheme. In the proposed update scheme, the weights of the neural network are discrete, and these discrete weights can gradually approach the optimal value through cooperative learning, thereby realizing the control of the unknown nonlinear system. Through the trained neural network, it is proved if the interconnection topology is undirected and connected, the state of the unknown nonlinear system can converge to the target trajectory after a finite time, and the error of the system can converge to a small neighbourhood around the origin. It is also guaranteed that all closed-loop signals in the system are bounded. A simulation example is provided to more intuitively prove the effectiveness of the proposed distributed cooperative learning control scheme at the end of the article.

The considered switching law, not only generalizes the commonly studied dwell-time (DT) and average DT (ADT) switchings, but also further attaches mode-dependency to the persistent DT (PDT) switching that is shown to be more general. Multiple communication channels, which include one primary channel and multiredundant channels, are considered to coexist for the state estimation of underlying switched neural networks. The desired mode-dependent filters are designed such that the resulting filtering error system is exponentially mean-square stable with a guaranteed nonweighted generalized H-2 performance index. It is verified that better filtering performance index can be achieved as the number of channels to be used increases. The potential and effectiveness of the developed theoretical results are demonstrated via a numerical example.

Multi-objective optimization of water distribution networks using particle swarm optimization	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Most applied optimization problems involve several objectives, which must be solved simultaneously within a set of constraints. When conflicting objectives exist, there is no single solution to be chosen as the best one, but a set of optimal solutions to the problem. When the decision variables are discrete, the complexity of the problem increases even further. In the present work, a multi-objective model is presented to solve the problem of water distribution network optimization with discrete variables. The problem has a mixed discrete nonlinear programming formulation. A new algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is proposed in order to solve the model. Hydraulic simulator EPANET v2.1 is used to calculate the pressure at each node and flow velocity of water in each pipe. Two problems from the literature are studied, having as objectives the minimization of pipeline installation costs and the minimization of pumping energy costs for the system. Through the weighted sum method, the problems of WDN were solved. The proposed algorithm is verified to be efficient, with equal or better results than those found in the literature.

Unlike these theoretical results, in order to develop impulsive control schemes for discrete-time and continuous-time neural networks (NNs) in a unified framework. This article investigates impulsive control design of timescale-type NNs (TNNs) with parameter mismatches and time-varying delays (TVDs). First, several timescale impulsive differential inequalities are demonstrated by the timescale theory, which offer new inequality techniques for the investigation of timescale-type impulsive systems. Next, some criteria are proved for discrete-time NNs and TNNs by utilizing impulsive control theory, timescale inequality techniques, and the average impulsive interval method. Unlike the published works, this article gives some impulsive control schemes to ensure quasi-synchronization (QS) even if there exist TVDs in TNNs.

Designing temporal networks that synchronize under resource constraints	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Being fundamentally a non-equilibrium process, synchronization comes with unavoidable energy costs and has to be maintained under the constraint of limited resources. Such resource constraints are often reflected as a finite coupling budget available in a network to facilitate interaction and communication. Here, we show that introducing temporal variation in the network structure can lead to efficient synchronization even when stable synchrony is impossible in any static network under the given budget, thereby demonstrating a fundamental advantage of temporal networks. The temporal networks generated by our open-loop design are versatile in the sense of promoting synchronization for systems with vastly different dynamics, including periodic and chaotic dynamics in both discrete-time and continuous-time models. Furthermore, we link the dynamic stabilization effect of the changing topology to the curvature of the master stability function, which provides analytical insights into synchronization on temporal networks in general. In particular, our results shed light on the effect of network switching rate and explain why certain temporal networks synchronize only for intermediate switching rate. The ability of complex networks to synchronize themselves is limited by available coupling resources. Zhang and Strogatz show that allowing temporal variation in the network structure can lead to synchronization even when stable synchrony is impossible in any static network under the fixed budget.

Especially, the uncertainties which occur in the inner coupling matrix are categorized with the use of the interval matrix approach. The main purpose of this work is to design an appropriate state feedback controller with a saturation effect that guarantees asymptotic synchronization and also satisfy a prescribed level of mixed H-infinity and passivity performance for the addressed CDNs. Moreover, a new set of adequate criteria are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities to synchronize the considered network plant. The above synchronization criteria are retrieved with the support of an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, Kronecker product properties together with Jensen's inequality and Abel lemma. Eventually, the efficiency and superiority of our proposed synchronization criteria are demonstrated through two numerical examples.

Most of the well-known discrete-time power control algorithms can be reformulated into simple continuous-time dynamic equations in the logarithmic scale. A 'surrogate derivative' model yields the continuous-time system dynamics for each local user. It reveals that many of the most popular and powerful existing power control update laws can actually be comprehended as the discrete-time versions of the standard continuous-time control strategies. The continuous-time dynamic system formulation provides a new avenue to the uplink power control designs for wireless networks such that many existing useful control methodologies can be directly employed for solving the SIR-based wireless communication power control problems. Yates' power convergence conditions for the distributed power control (DPC), originally given for the discrete-time power control updates, are also presented in the continuous-time framework in this paper. We have shown that CDMA 2000 (IS-95) standard for mobile power updates uses a sliding mode control technique, and that the DPC algorithm is based on a linear state feedback control law.																					978-1-4244-3381-0				2009							60	+																WOS:000270940400012

The main contribute of this paper is that the CSTR system are in discrete-time form and non-symmetric dead-zone inputs are considered here. The design parameters of control algorithm for the CSTR systems are not so much than before, such that the calculated amount of the control algorithm is less than before.

The transmission package dropouts result in the loss of control input and the asynchronous switching between the subsystems and the associated controllers. Before studying the networked control, the sufficient conditions of exponential stability and stabilization of discrete-time periodic piecewise linear systems are proposed via the constructed dwell-time dependent Lyapunov function with time-varying Lyapunov matrix at first. Then to tackle the bounded time-varying packet dropouts issue of switching signal in the networked control, a continuous unified time-varying Lyapunov function is employed for both the synchronous and asynchronous subintervals of subsystems, the corresponding stabilization conditions are developed. The state-feedback stabilizing controller can be directly designed by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) instead of iterative optimization used in continuous-time periodic piecewise linear systems.

For a multi-device multi-cloud network, the real-time computing requirements, frequently varied wireless channel gains and changeable network scale, make the system more dynamic. It is critical to satisfy the dynamic nature of network with different constraints of IoT devices in multi-cloud environment. In this paper, we establish a continuous-discrete hybrid decision offloading model, each device should learn to make coordinated actions, including cloud server selection, offloading ratio and local computation capacity. Therefore, both continuous-discrete hybrid decision and coordination among IoT devices are challenging. To this end, we first develop a probabilistic method to relax the discrete action (e.g. cloud server selection) to a continuous set. Then, by leveraging a centralized training and distributed execution strategy, we design a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CMADRL) based framework to minimize the total system cost in terms of the energy consumption of IoT device and the renting charge of cloud servers. Each IoT device acts as an agent, which not only learns efficient decentralized policies, but also relieves IoT devices' computing pressure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMADRL could efficiently learn dynamic offloading polices at each IoT device, and significantly outperform the four state-of-the-art DRL based agents and two heuristic algorithms with lower system cost.

J	Ding, SB; Wang, ZS; Zhang, HG				Ding, Sanbo; Wang, Zhanshan; Zhang, Huaguang			Event-Triggered Stabilization of Neural Networks With Time-Varying Switching Gains and Input Saturation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												This paper investigates the event-triggered stabilization of neural networks (NNs) subject to input saturation. The main core lies in the design of a novel controller with time-varying switching gains and the associated switching event-triggered condition (ETC). The ETC is essentially a switching between the aperiodic sampling and continuous event trigger. The control gains of the designed controller are composed of an exponentially decaying term and two gain matrices. The two gain matrices are required to be switched when the switching between the aperiodic sampling and continuous event trigger is met. By employing the generalized sector condition and switching Lyapunov function, several sufficient conditions that ensure the local exponential stability of the NNs are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Both the exponentially decaying term and switching gains improve the feasible region of LMIs, and then they are helpful to enlarge the set of admissible initial conditions, the threshold in ETC, and the average waiting time. Together with several optimization problems, two numerical examples are employed to validate the effectiveness of our results.					yang, yue/KCK-7870-2024	Ding, Sanbo/0000-0002-1438-5330													2162-237X	2162-2388				OCT	2018	29	10					5045	5056		10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2787642	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2787642								29994184					WOS:000445351300040

Vincent			Cooperative Internet of UAVs: Distributed Trajectory Design by Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS												Due to the advantages of flexible deployment and extensive coverage, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have significant potential for sensing applications in the next generation of cellular networks, which will give rise to a cellular Internet of UAVs. In this article, we consider a cellular Internet of UAVs, where the UAVs execute sensing tasks through cooperative sensing and transmission to minimize the age of information (AoI). However, the cooperative sensing and transmission is tightly coupled with the UAVs' trajectories, which makes the trajectory design challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose a distributed sense-and-send protocol, where the UAVs determine the trajectories by selecting from a discrete set of tasks and a continuous set of locations for sensing and transmission. Based on this protocol, we formulate the trajectory design problem for AoI minimization and propose a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm to solve it based on deep reinforcement learning. The CA2C algorithm can learn the optimal policies for actions involving both continuous and discrete variables and is suited for the trajectory design. Our simulation results show that the CA2C algorithm outperforms four baseline algorithms. Also, we show that by dividing the tasks, cooperative UAVs can achieve a lower AoI compared to non-cooperative UAVs.					song, ling/GQZ-5934-2022; Poor, H.

This question is investigated and a statistical method for selecting optimal experimental design points for multilayer perceptrons is introduced. Two-class discrimination problems are examined in which the multilayer perceptron is viewed as a univariate nonlinear regression model. A selection criterion is developed based on thr volume of the joint confidence ellipsoid for the weights in a multilayer perceptron. The criterion is minimized to find optimal design points. Minimization is accomplished using Powell's algorithm when the feature space is continuous and a discrete exchange algorithm when the feature space is discrete. An example is used to demonstrate: the superiority of optimally selected design points over randomly chosen points and points chosen in a grid pattern. In addition, two measures are developed to rank the design points in terms of their relative importance.																			0094-9655						1999	64	4					301	325		10.1080/00949659908811983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00949659908811983													WOS:000085386000002

Reaction systems and reactor design often determine the character of the flowsheet. However, research in reactor network synthesis has met with limited success because of nonlinear reaction models, uncertain rate laws, and numerous possible reactor types and networks. In this paper we take advantage of attainable-region properties derived from geometric targeting techniques to design a concise reactor module for reactor network synthesis. The reactor module is made up of a continuous stirred tank reactor and a plug flow reactor (for two dimensional targeting) or a differential sidestream reactor (for higher dimensions). These modules are used to synthesize the optimal reactor network target with respect to a specific objective function, and the problem is formulated as a compact mixed integer nonlinear program. This new algorithm overcomes many of the drawbacks of existing algorithms. Finally, we solve several example problems to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and discuss applications to simultaneous reactor network and process synthesis.

Partov: a network simulation and emulation tool	JOURNAL OF SIMULATION												Network protocol design and evaluation requires either full implementation of the considered protocol and evaluation in a real network, or a simulation based on a model. There is also a middle approach in which both simulation and emulation are used to evaluate a protocol. In this article the Partov engine, which provides both simulation and emulation capabilities simultaneously, is presented. Partov benefits from a layered and platform-independent architecture. As a pure simulator, it provides an extensible plugin-based platform that can be configured to perform both real-time and non-real-time discrete-event simulations. It also acts as an emulator, making interaction with real networks possible in real time. Additionally, a declarative XML-based language is used, acting as a glue between simulation and emulation modules and plugins. It supports dynamic network modelling and simulation based on continuous time Markov chains. Partov is compared with other well-known tools such as NS-3 and real processes such as Hping3. It is shown that Partov requires less overhead and is much more scalable than NS-3.

J	Kim, JW; Lee, JG; Lee, D; Shim, H				Kim, Jeong Woo; Lee, Jin Gyu; Lee, Donggil; Shim, Hyungbo			A design method of distributed algorithms via discrete-time blended dynamics theorem	AUTOMATICA												We develop a discrete-time version of the blended dynamics theorem for the use of designing distributed computation algorithms. The blended dynamics theorem enables to predict the behavior of heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Therefore, once we get a blended dynamics for a particular computational task, design idea of node dynamics for individual heterogeneous agents can easily occur. In the continuous-time case, prediction by blended dynamics was enabled by high coupling gain among neighboring agents. In the discrete-time case, we propose an equivalent action, which we call multi-step coupling in this paper. Compared to the continuous-time case, the blended dynamics can have more variety depending on the coupling matrix. This benefit is demonstrated with three applications; distributed estimation of network size, distributed computation of the PageRank, and distributed computation of the degree sequence of a graph, which correspond to the coupling by doubly-stochastic, column-stochastic, and row-stochastic matrices, respectively.

A Novel Distance for Clustering to Support Mixed Data Attributes and Promote Data Reliability and Network Lifetime in Large Scale Wireless Sensor Networks	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEM DESIGN 2011	Procedia Engineering				International Conference on Communication Technology and System Design	DEC 07-09, 2011	Coimbatore, INDIA					Clustering based approaches in Wireless Sensor Networks helps in identifying the summarized data by exploiting the feature of data redundancy in sensor networks. Due to the inexpensive hardware used and unattended operation nature, nodes in the sensor networks are often prone to many failures malicious attacks and resource constraints and data collected in sensor networks are found to be unreliable. Moreover, the wide usages of sensor network in diverse application have put a constraint on sensor protocol to handle data of mixed types. To address the issues of energy minimization and data reliability, we propose a distributed agglomerative cluster based anomaly detection algorithm termed DACAD to detect the faulty readings based on kNN approach. Additionally, to support applications with mixed data attributes, we design a heterogeneous distance function, HOEM to handle both continuous and nominal attributes. In this paper we have evaluated the performance of proposed algorithm in terms of false alarm rate, false positive rate and detection rate. Our results demonstrate that the proposed distance achieves a comparable detection rate with low false alarm rate with a significant reduction in computation and communication over head and operates with both continuous and nominal data.

The number of fuzzy rules and the membership functions for the SOF controller are different from those for the plant. A sufficient criterion of reliable stability with mixed H2/H performance is derived for the closed-loop system with sensor failure. The SOF controller is designed for two different cases (known sensor failure case and unknown sensor failure case) to guarantee the reliable stability with mixed H2/H performance.

In this maritime communication networks (MCNs), it is challenging for the UAV to determine its trajectory on the ocean, since it cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, the trajectory should be pre-designed before the UAV takes off. Furthermore, the take-off location of the UAV and the sea lane of the vessel may be random, which leads to a highly dynamic environment. To address these issues, we propose two reinforcement learning schemes, Q-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, to solve the discrete and continuous UAV trajectory design problem, respectively. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed reinforcement learning schemes versus the existing schemes in the literature. Additionally, the proposed DDPG algorithm converges faster and achieves higher utilities for the UAV, compared to the Q-learning algorithm.					sheng, zhichao/AAH-6607-2019; Wang, Huiyan/JXW-9178-2024; WANG, YILUN/KFB-0627-2024; cai, wen/JWP-4797-2024; Zhao, ZiHao/KHT-4413-2024; Jiang, Cheng/JHU-0179-2023; LU, lpp pp/JFJ-9011-2023; Zhang, Xiaoyue/JFS-9880-2023; chen, jiayi/KHV-5520-2024; Wang, Jinguo/JED-9233-2023	sheng, zhichao/0000-0003-0288-7031; 													1673-5447					SEP	2022	19	9					26	36		10.23919/JCC.2022.09.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2022.09.003													WOS:000859063600008

However, in their current implementations, various real-time data in the vehicle control system are exchanged via a controller area network (CAN), which causes network congestion and network-induced delays. These problems could lead to systemic instability and make the system integration difficult. The goal of this paper is to provide a design methodology that can cope with all these challenges for the lateral motion control of AWID-EVs. Firstly, a continuous-time model of an AWID-EV is derived. Then an expression for determining upper and lower bounds on the delays caused by CAN is presented and with which a discrete-time model of the closed-loop CAN system is derived. An expression on the bandwidth utilization is introduced as well. Thirdly, a co-design based scheme combining a period-dependent linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and a dynamic period scheduler is designed for the resulting model and the stability criterion is also derived. The results of simulations and hard-in-loop (HIL) experiments show that the proposed methodology can effectively guarantee the stability of the vehicle lateral motion control while obviously declining the network congestion.

The control policy is distributed in the sense that it uses those traffic lights in the vicinity of the jammed area. We model urban traffic using a discrete fluid-like model which is then reduced to a hybrid dynamical system with binary control inputs. For this system, we define notions of local control and localizability of disturbances. We then present a control strategy that uses only local controllers to attenuate traffic jams. This control design is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) whose solution provides traffic light schedules. We show that the feasibility of this MILP is both necessary and sufficient for localizability. Finally, we illustrate this design on a test urban transportation network.

Flexibility in planning decisions makes modular manufacturing a promising way to address this problem. In this work, the problem of multiperiod process and supply chain network design is considered under demand uncertainty. A mixed integer two-stage stochastic programming problem is formulated with integer variables indicating the process design and continuous variables to represent the material flow in the supply chain. The problem is solved using a rolling horizon approach. Benders decomposition is used to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem. To promote risk-averse decisions, a downside risk measure is incorporated in the model. The results demonstrate the several advantages of modular designs in meeting product demands.

The proposed model formulation has an integrate base structured with a mesoscopic link load-computing component that explicitly takes into account the acceleration behavior of discrete vehicle packets and an algorithm written with a set of nodal rules considering the constraints of link dynamics, flow conservation, flow propagation, and boundary conditions. The solution to the model formulation is obtained by simulation, where the coded algorithm of the proposed solution method is run after designing a discrete version of the problem. The performance of the proposed model, as a DNL model, is tested on a sample highway network following its validation study that is obtained on a sample highway node. It is seen that the proposed model provides consistent approximations to link flow dynamics. The new dynamic node model proposed in this paper is unique in that it encapsulates a mesoscopic approach in node-based flow dynamics modeling.

The proposed schemes utilise both adaptive rate and adaptive power transmission with individual average power constraints for the relay and the transmitter. To obtain an analytical insight into the network performance, schemes with continuous rate adaptation are designed at first. Next, transmission schemes with discrete rate and power adaptation are developed for practical systems. An amplify-forward relaying scenario with diversity is considered in which signals at the destination are received from both the transmitter and the relay. Albeit, the schemes could be simplified for the network without diversity in which there is no path for the signal from the transmitter to the receiver. Schemes with constant power transmission are also designed and analysed. Numerical evaluations show that there is a considerable performance gain in using adaptive power transmission compared to the constant power scheme at the cost of a reasonable complexity increase.						taki, mehrdad/0000-0003-0063-2166													1751-8628	1751-8636				OCT 15	2013	7	15					1656	1664		10.1049/iet-com.2012.0580	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-com.2012.0580													WOS:000325980500010
