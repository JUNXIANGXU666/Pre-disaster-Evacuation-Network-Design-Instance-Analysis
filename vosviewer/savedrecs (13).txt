J	Suri, R; Desiraju, R				Suri, R; Desiraju, R			Performance analysis of flexible manufacturing systems with a single discrete material-handling device	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS												We present an analytical model for performance prediction of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) with a single discrete material-handling device (MHD). This configuration of FMS is significant for many reasons: it is commonly found in industry, it simplifies material-handling control, it is amenable to analytical modelling, and it forms a building block for more complex systems. Standard queueing models are inadequate to analyze this configuration because of the need to take into consideration many nontrivial issues such as state-dependent routing, interference from the MHD, and the analysis of the MHD. To account for state-dependent routing, we develop an iterative method that is built around mean value analysis. To analyze the MHD interference, we use two queueing network models. In the first, we ignore queueing at the MHD but model the interference from the MHD by inflating the station service times. The second network models the queueing for the MHD and estimates the blocking (inflation) times needed for the first model. By iterating between the two networks, we are able to predict the performance of this configuration of FMS. Our analytical estimates are validated against discrete event simulation and shown to be quite accurate for initial system design.

On the other hand, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are also important in MANETs to effectively identify malicious activities. Considering these two approaches jointly is effective in optimal security design taking into account system security requirements and resource constraints in MANETs. To obtain the optimal scheme of combining continuous user authentication and IDSs in a distributed manner, we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) multi-armed bandit problem. We present a structural results method to solve the problem for a large network with a variety of nodes. The policies derived from structural results are easy to implement in practical MANETs.

A general hazardous waste reverse logistics network consists of sources, collection centers, treatment centers, processing/recycling facilities, and disposal facilities. We study a reverse logistics network specifically for household hazardous wastes and examine its difference from a non-hazardous and industrial waste network. We consider multiobjective mixed-integer deterministic and stochastic mathematical models that are designed to answer the following questions: which facilities or centers should be opened, which routes should be utilized, and how much waste should be transported to each location in order to minimize the transportation cost, transportation/site risk, and to maximize household convenience for the purpose of participation increase at collection stage. Specifically, we propose an optimization framework for the management of hazardous household wastes, and consider the waste paint network in the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada as a test bed for our analysis. Finally, we provide easy-to-interpret visualization tools for the problem, which help interpreting the model outcomes and identifying policy insights.

Provisioning virtual private networks under traffic uncertainty	NETWORKS					Optimization 2004 Conference	JUL 25-28, 2004	Univ Lisbon, Lisbon, PORTUGAL	APDIO, CIO	Univ Lisbon			We investigate a network design problem under traffic uncertainty that arises when provisioning Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): given a set of terminals that must communicate with one another, and a set of possible traffic matrices, sufficient capacity has to be reserved on the links of the large underlying public network to support all possible traffic matrices while minimizing the total reservation cost. The problem admits several versions depending on the desired topology of the reserved links, and the nature of the traffic data uncertainty. We present compact linear mixed-integer programming formulations for the problem with the classical hose traffic model and for a less conservative robust variant relying on the traffic statistics that are often available. These flow-based formulations allow us to solve optimally medium-to-large instances with commercial MIP solvers. We also propose a combined branch-and-price and cutting-plane algorithm to tackle larger instances. Computational results obtained for several classes of instances are reported and discussed.

The LSTM principle allows a recurrent neural network to store and to retrieve information over long time periods, which was shown to be well-suited for the modeling of co-articulation effects in human speech. Our system uses a bidirectional LSTM network to generate a phoneme prediction feature that is observed by a triphone-based large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) decoder, together with conventional MFCC features. We evaluate both, phoneme prediction error rates of various network architectures and the word recognition performance of our Tandem approach using the COSINE database - a large corpus of conversational and noisy speech, and show that incorporating LSTM phoneme predictions in to an LVCSR system leads to significantly higher word accuracies.

This study employs a series of physical tests to obtain the physical and contact parameters of red clover seeds. A discrete element model of red clover seeds is established. Plackett-Burman Design, steepest ascent, and Central Composite Design experiments are sequentially conducted. The simulation deviation of the resting angle of red clover seeds is employed as the evaluation criterion for parameter optimization. The results indicate that the coefficients of static friction between red clover seeds, the coefficients of rolling friction between red clover seeds, and the coefficients of static friction between red clover seeds and the steel plates significantly influence the resting angle. Modeling was performed using a backpropagation neural network, a genetic algorithm-optimized BP network, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. It was found that GA-BP ensured both accuracy and stability. Compared to the traditional response surface methodology, GA-BP showed better fitting performance. For the optimized red clover seed simulation, the error between the angle of repose and the physical experiment was 0.98%. This research provides new insights into the calibration of small-grain seed parameters, demonstrating the value of GA-BP for precision modeling.

However, the Taguchi method is unable to deal with dynamic multiresponse owing to increasing complexity of the product or design process. Although several alternative approaches have been presented to resolve this problem, they cannot effectively treat situations in which the control factors have continuous values. This study incorporates desirability functions into a hybrid neural network/genetic algorithm approach to optimize the parameter design of dynamic multiresponse with continuous values of parameters. The objective is to find the optimal combination of control factors to simultaneously maximize robustness of each response. The proposed approach is based on three stages which (1) use neural networks for constructing a response function model of a dynamic multiresponse system, (2) use exponential desirability functions for evaluating overall performance of a specific factor combination, and (3) use a genetic algorithm to optimize parameter design. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a simulated example. Analysis results reveal that the approach has higher performance than the traditional experimental design.

Considering this influence of denial of service attacks on event-triggered state, the maximum system performance lost is calculated. The sufficient conditions of system stability are derived by using the Lyapunov functional method. The constructive design of the controller is expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

Fractional differentiation is considered based on Caputo concept and the fractional order is considered to be between 0 and 1. In order to estimate a time continuous fractional order nonlinear system with unknown term in its dynamic, single-layer and double-layer RBF neural network is used. First, a parallel-series neural network observer is designed for state estimation. Weights of the neural network are updated adaptively and updating laws are presented in fractional order form. Using Lyapunov method, it is proved that state estimation error and weight estimation error of the neural network are bounded. Parameters of the neural estimator converge to ideal parameters which satisfy excitation condition stability. Then, multi-model estimation structure of fractional order nonlinear systems is presented and its application in fault detection is investigated. Finally, simulation results are presented to show efficiency of the proposed method.

Considering the non-convex characteristic of the trajectory design and power allocation problem, it is difficult to obtain the optimal joint strategy in UAV-assisted cellular networks. In this paper, a reinforcement learning-based approach is proposed to obtain the maximum long-term network utility while meeting with user equipments' quality of service requirement. The Markov decision process (MDP) is formulated with the design of state, action space, and reward function. In order to achieve the joint optimal policy of trajectory design and power allocation, deep reinforcement learning approach is investigated. Due to the continuous action space of the MDP model, deep deterministic policy gradient approach is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other approaches on overall network utility performance with higher system capacity and faster processing speed.

C.; Cao, Jinde			Minimal Control Nodes for Strong Structural Observability of Discrete-Time Iterative Systems: Explicit Formulas and Polynomial-Time Algorithms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												In this article, we initiate an important class of vertex-marked directed graphs, referred to as the strong structurally observable graphs (SSOGs), to be the fundamental structural architectures ensuring the observability of several prevalent types of discrete-time iteration systems. This article also answers the minimal control node problem of SSOGs by carrying out two explicit formulas and the corresponding polynomial-time algorithms. Primitively, by exploring the strong structural observability of Boolean networks, an underlying class of SSOGs is proposed as an extended counterpart of network structures of observable conjunctive Boolean networks, while we call for particular attention to network structures instead of node dynamics. With such a class of SSOGs, we justify that a general class of discrete-time iterative systems can also be well addressed. In our formulation, the robustness against the uncertainties in nodal dynamics is achieved by merely exploiting the information on network structures. Two minimal synthesis strategies are, respectively, established to render a directed graph strongly structurally observable in a polynomial amount of time via placing a minimal number of sensors or controlling the nodes. Notably, apart from explicitly calculating the minimal set of control nodes, the structural insights are also leveraged to account for the close relations between the observability of considered iteration systems and observed-path-compatible paths and cycles in the network structures. For certain special yet worthy cases, the SSOGs are specialized in the strong structural observability of finite-field networks and derive the minimum pinned node theorem of Boolean networks with a biological case study as an efficient demonstration.

The networks are programmed by the template-parameters. A fundamental question in template training or adaptation is the gradient computation or approximation of the error as a function of the template parameters. Exact equations are developed for computing the gradients. These equations are similar to the CNN network equations, i.e. they have the same neighborhood and connectivity as the original CNN network. It is shown that a CNN network, with a modified output function, can compute the gradients. Thus, fast on-line gradient computation is possible via the CNN Universal Machine, which allows on-line adaptation and training. The method for computing the gradient on-chip is investigated and demonstrated.

It is worth pointing out that our network model is composed of nodes with different state dimensions and its outer coupling configuration matrix can be asymmetric. In addition, since a small percentage of nodes that play more important role than others usually exist in a network, thus, one important node, which is named as crucial node in this paper, is taken into account in our network model. Besides, the commonality between each node and the crucial node is also precisely expressed. Further, based on the crucial node and the commonality and associated with the Lyapunov stability theory, two control strategies are addressed to realize the exponential matrix projective synchronization (EMPS) and asymptotic matrix projective synchronization (AMPS), respectively. It should be stressed that only the crucial node is controlled and only the state of the crucial node is applied to design the EMPS and AMPS controllers. This is promising to reduce the control cost as much as possible and to improve the feasibility of our MPS strategies. The effectiveness and feasibility of our MPS schemes are rigorously proved in theory as well as verified by two numerical examples. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Confraria, J; Ribeiro, T; Vasconcelos, H				Confraria, Joao; Ribeiro, Tiago; Vasconcelos, Helder			Analysis of consumer preferences for mobile telecom plans using a discrete choice experiment	TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY												In this paper, we present a study of consumer preferences for mobile telecommunications plans and operator characteristics. The objective of the study was to identify consumer preferences for the following characteristics of mobile plans: the importance of using the same provider as friends and family (calling club network effects), the market share of the provider (pure network effects), the length of the commitment period, monthly fee/recharge obligations and per minute call charges for calls made within and outside the provider network. A discrete choice experiment was used as a preference elicitation method and implemented in face-to-face interviews. We present results regarding willingness to pay for the described features as well as their relationship to socio-demographic variables. Consumers are willing to pay 1.3 Euro per month more to reduce the commitment period from 1 year to 6 months and willing to pay 2.5 euros per month more to be part of a larger network. Consumers are also twice as much more sensitive to within-network price variations than extra-network price variations. These results remain unchanged in the sub-sample of those that have internet access suggesting that a web based surveys are capable of producing unbiased results.

J	Yun, J				Yun, Jaewoong			Relationship between the Significant Solutions of Static Traffic Assignment Problems for Mixed Traffic Flow of Connected and Automated Vehicles and Human-Driven Vehicles	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY												Connected and automated vehicles can reduce the traffic congestion level of the entire network through platoon-driving technologies compared to human-driven vehicles. One promising approach to enhancing platoon-driving technology's efficiency is deploying dedicated lanes or roads for connected and automated vehicles. Since asymmetric interactions between different vehicle types increase road congestion, it is necessary to distinguish routes for efficient traffic management. However, the traditional traffic assignment problem, which uses only user equilibrium as a constraint with no difference in travel time between users, could not be proposed as a globally optimal solution because it generates an infinite number of locally optimal solutions. Recent studies have attempted to overcome the limitations by considering the sum of system-wide travel times as an additional constraint. Their research sought to help propose optimal deployment strategies through the lowest total travel time solution (best-case) or design robust transport planning strategies through the highest total travel time solution (worst-case). However, past studies have not focused on the possibility of the best/worst case appearing in reality. This study focused on the relationship between the two solutions pointed out in past studies and traffic patterns likely to appear in reality. This study interprets the Karush-Kun-Tucker condition of the static traffic assignment problem, considering the asymmetric interaction, and proposes a solution algorithm using discrete dynamics. The proposed algorithm extends the most widely used method in transportation planning research, which can overcome the limitations of asymmetric interaction problems through simple variations. The proposed algorithm can reliably derive two solutions, and entropy theory shows that both solutions are unlikely to appear in reality without additional policies such as dedicated lanes or roads.																			1026-0226	1607-887X				MAY 18	2024	2024								9400721	10.1155/2024/9400721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2024/9400721													WOS:001230954900001

However, the process of building, training, and evaluating mixed-signal neural models is slow and laborious. In this paper, we introduce an open-source framework, called EBANA, that provides a unified, modularized, and extensible infrastructure for building and validating analog neural networks (ANNs). It already includes the most common building blocks and maintains sufficient modularity and extensibility to easily incorporate new concepts. It uses Python as interface language with a syntax similar to Keras, while hiding the complexity of the underlying analog simulations. These features make EBANA suitable for researchers and practitioners to experiment with different design topologies and explore the various tradeoffs that exist in the design space.

Moreover, communication constraints are taken into account to reflect more realistic communication networks. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the approximation property of the radial basis function neural networks, the control protocol for each agent is designed, where all the information is exchanged in the form of sampled data instead of ideal continuous-time communications. Findings - By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, sufficient conditions are developed to guarantee that all the followers can converge to the convex hull spanned by the stationary leaders. Originality/value - As ideal continuous-time communications of the multi-agent systems are very difficult or even unavailable to achieve, the neural-network-based containment control of nonlinear multi-agent systems is solved under communication constraints. More precisely, sampled-data information is exchanged, which is more applicable and practical in the real-world applications.																			0144-5154	1758-4078					2016	36	2					179	185		10.1108/AA-11-2015-107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/AA-11-2015-107													WOS:000376116400010

Since filtering and compensation devices for power factor are no longer a solution, the continuous monitoring and control of power quality for each device in an energy distribution network becomes mandatory. In this way, a better solution is to integrate Power Quality sensors in each electronic device and to implement a control solution for continuous network surveillance. The large number of electronics devices targeted for power quality surveillance usually raises the problem of integrating the sensors in a control network. The paper presents a model of Power Quality control system consisting in a distributed network of sensors integrated in a wireless network in order to reduce wire harnesses and to implement a fast communication link with each sensor or controller device. The main challenges of such a design along with its benefits are detailed in the paper. The proposed system will allow a better energy control along with efficient communication architecture, increasing the power quality "awareness" of the energy distribution network.

We present an arc-based formulation. We propose two approaches respectively based on matheuristics: local branching and relaxation induced neighborhood search. These approaches hybridize metaheuristic strategies and mathematical programming, and use an idea of defining neighborhoods as small mixed integer programs (MIP), and exploring neighborhoods using MIP solvers. We also present an implementation combining these two approaches. In addition, we propose a Lagrangian heuristic to generate a starting solution.

Discrete event command and control for network teams with multiple military missions	JOURNAL OF DEFENSE MODELING AND SIMULATION-APPLICATIONS METHODOLOGY TECHNOLOGY-JDMS												During mission execution in military applications, the US Army Training and Doctrine Command Pamphlet 525-66 Battle Command and Battle Space Awareness capabilities prescribe expectations that networked teams will perform in a reliable manner under changing mission requirements, varying resource availability and reliability, resource faults, etc. In this paper, a command and control structure is presented that allows for computer-aided execution of the networked team decision-making process, control of force resources, shared-resource dispatching, and adaptability to change based on battlefield conditions. A mathematically justified networked computing environment is provided called the Discrete Event Control (DEC) framework. DEC has the ability to provide the logical connectivity among all team participants, including mission planners, field commanders, warfighters, and robotic platforms. The proposed data management tools are developed and demonstrated with a simulation study on a realistic military ambush attack. The results show that the tasks of multiple missions are correctly sequenced in real time, and that shared resources are suitably assigned to competing tasks under dynamically changing conditions without conflicts and bottlenecks.																			1548-5129	1557-380X				JUL	2015	12	3					241	255		10.1177/1548512912472772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1548512912472772													WOS:000367550200004

In the public sub-network, a tradable credit scheme is applied to mitigate traffic congestion. In the private sub-network, tolls are collected by the private company, but the toll levels and toll locations are determined by the government. The purpose of toll charge is two-fold: on the one hand, the government uses it as a tool for mitigating congestion; on the other hand, a threshold of revenue should be guaranteed for the profitability of the private company. A bi-level programming model is formulated to minimize the total travel time in the network by taking into account the user equilibrium travel behaviour and the revenue requirement of private firms. To obtain a global optimum solution, the bi-level model is transformed into an equivalent single-level mixed integer linear program that can be easily solved with commercial software. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the mixed management schemes can achieve favourable targets, namely, joint implementation of road tolls and tradable credits can effectively mitigate traffic congestion and meanwhile maintain reasonable revenue for the private company.					zhang, xiaoning/G-7018-2012														0353-5320	1848-4069					2017	29	6					603	611		10.7307/ptt.v29i6.2410	http://dx.doi.org/10.7307/ptt.v29i6.2410													WOS:000419307900005

Effect of particle shape in grinding mills using a GPU based DEM code	MINERALS ENGINEERING												The reduction in particle size of raw materials using grinding mills is an energy and cost intensive task. Optimization of grinding processes is not trivial as obtaining experimental information is extremely difficult due to the harsh environment. Thus, computational modeling is the most feasible option for obtaining information on the dynamics of the media. However, the computational cost of modeling each particle is high, resulting in the shape of the media being approximated by simple shapes, and in most cases, a reduction in the size of the mill. Even with these simplifications typical simulations take many weeks to months to complete making it infeasible for design prototyping and process optimization. In the last decade, the Graphical Processor Unit (GPU) has enabled large scale simulations of tens of millions of spheres in ball mills using the Blaze-DEM GPU code. Recently, this code was expanded to provide detailed contact detection for polyhedra using the volume-overlap method which is the most accurate approach amongst commercial and academic codes. In this study we first validated the code against experimental results for spherical and cube particle systems in a lab-scale ball mill. Thereafter, we performed a number of ball mill simulations with four additional polyhedral particle systems (truncated tetrahedra, Biluna, elongated hexagonal prisms and a mixed polyhedral particle systems) to study the effect of particle shape. This allows for a first investigation into the roles of particle angularity and aspect ratio on power draw, normal and shear power dissipation between particles, particles and lifters and, particles and the shell. We also show qualitative differences in charge profiles and force chain networks between the various particle systems.

Firstly, different from the existing ADP methods, a creative formulation of the cost function introduces the control input into the tracking error, and ignores the quadratic form of the control input directly. Second, a novel static triggering mechanism is designed. The proposed approach samples the states and updates the control signal only when the triggered condition is satisfied, and critic-actor Neural network (NN) is designed to approach the performance index and control input. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system is provided based on the Lyapunov's theorem. Finally, in order to obtain a larger event triggering time interval, a dynamic triggering mechanism is given. Theoretical results show that the system state and the network weight errors are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). A simulation result also verify the theoretical claims.

Extended Dissipative State Estimation for Markov Jump Neural Networks With Unreliable Links	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												This paper is concerned with the problem of extended dissipativity-based state estimation for discrete-time Markov jump neural networks (NNs), where the variation of the piecewise time-varying transition probabilities of Markov chain is subject to a set of switching signals satisfying an average dwell-time property. The communication links between the NNs and the estimator are assumed to be imperfect, where the phenomena of signal quantization and data packet dropouts occur simultaneously. The aim of this paper is to contribute with a Markov switching estimator design method, which ensures that the resulting error system is extended stochastically dissipative, in the simultaneous presences of packet dropouts and signal quantization stemmed from unreliable communication links. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of such a problem are established. Based on the derived conditions, an explicit expression of the desired Markov switching estimator is presented. Finally, two illustrated examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

J	Srivastava, SK; Amula, A; Ghagare, P				Srivastava, Samir K.; Amula, Abhilash; Ghagare, Prakash			Service facility relocation decision: a case study	FACILITIES												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present issues and challenges faced during a firm's facility relocation decision aimed at improving both cost and service performance in an innovative service context. Design/methodology/approach - The reader is given background of the decision-making process behind single service facility relocation decision using a detailed case study. Key financial, operational and business data of the firm are collected, compiled and analysed. The solution methodology uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses to choose the best among the three possible discrete location choices. For propriety reasons, some information has been disguised, and some data have been sanitized. Findings - The factors that significantly influence relocation decision are proximity to high transaction customers, infrastructure and other input costs, customer service level requirements and extant regulations. Transportation has a direct impact on cost as well as service level. Most of the findings are in line with literature, but some of them differ too. Research limitations/implications - The approach is focused on a single case study of a pooling container firm in the Indian context and thereby limits the ability to generalize the findings. Nevertheless, this study may serve as a significant starting point for future research. Practical implications - Firms can create a rational, efficient and even-handed approach for relocation of facilities applying a mix of qualitative and quantitative models judiciously. It provides managers better understanding and insights and actions needed for single service facility relocation. Originality/value - This work is perhaps the first on facility relocation in emerging economies covering actual interventions and experiences. It gives new insights to a limited literature of relocating single service facility reflecting both theoretical imperatives and practitioner requirements.

J	Kourepinis, V; Iliopoulou, C; Tassopoulos, I; Beligiannis, G				Kourepinis, Vasileios; Iliopoulou, Christina; Tassopoulos, Ioannis; Beligiannis, Grigorios			An artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm for the urban transit routing problem	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												The Urban Transit Routing Problem (UTRP) is an NP-hard discrete problem that deals with the design of routes for public transport systems. It is a highly complex, multiply constrained problem, while the evaluation of candidate route sets can prove both challenging and time-consuming, with many potential solutions rejected on the grounds of infeasibility. Due to its difficulty, metaheuristic methods, such us swarm intelligence algorithms, are considered highly suitable for the UTRP. The suitability of these methods heavily relies on the correct adaptation of the chosen method for a discrete-space problem, the initialization procedure, and the solution evaluation method. In this context, this study proposes an artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm for the efficient solution of the UTRP, presenting a novel discrete-space adaptation of the former. The results are subsequently compared to 14 other algorithms, including evolutionary, swarm intelligence and hyper-heuristic implementations, using Mandl's widely used and accepted benchmark. Comparison of the produced solutions with published results on Mandl's benchmark network, shows that the developed algorithm yields superior results to the existing techniques, yielding very high shares of direct trip coverage, which is vital for transit systems to attract riders and contribute to urban sustainability. A new indicator for operator cost calculation is also developed and integrated into our analysis, offering insights on the trade-offs between user and operator costs. Differences in generated solutions, influenced by the weighting factor value, can result in variations of up to 13% in direct trip coverage and 1.5 minutes in average travel time.

Consensus protocol is designed such that some agents in a network reach a consistent value, while other agents reach another consistent value. The convergence of the system matrix is discussed based on the tools from matrix theory. An algebraic condition is established to guarantee couple-group consensus. Moreover, for a given communication topology, a theorem is derived on how to select proper control parameters and sampling period for couple-group consensus to be reached. Finally, simulation examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

To avoid an expensive massive deployment, we try to take advantage of possible coverage ovelaps over space and time, by introducing a novel combinatorial model that captures such overlaps. Under this model, we abstract the tracking network design problem by a combinatorial problem of covering a universe of elements by at least three sets (to ensure that each point in the network area is covered at any time by at least three sensors, and thus being localized). We then design and analyze an efficient approximate method for sensor placement and operation, that with high probability and in polynomial expected time achieves a Theta(log n) approximation ratio to the optimal solution. Our network design solution can be combined with alternative collaborative processing methods, to suitably fit different tracking scenaria.

Topological mixing for HDDCS is strictly proved theoretically at first. Topological mixing implies Devaney's definition of chaos in a compact space, but not vice versa. Therefore, the proof of topological mixing promotes the theoretical research of HDDCS. Then, a general design method for constructing HDDCS via loop-state contraction algorithm is given. The construction of the iterative function uncontrolled by random sequences (hereafter called iterative function) is the starting point of this research. On this basis, this paper put forward a general design method to solve the construction problem of HDDCS, and several examples illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this method. The adjacency matrix corresponding to the designed HDDCS is used to construct the chaotic Echo State Network (ESN) for predicting Mackey-Glass time series. Compared with other ESNs, the chaotic ESN has better prediction performance and is able to accurately predict a much longer period of time.					; Guyeux, Christophe/C-2153-2011	wang, qianxue/0000-0002-4063-5401; Guyeux, Christophe/0000-0003-0195-4378													1549-8328	1558-0806				SEP	2021	68	9					3794	3807		10.1109/TCSI.2021.3091404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3091404													WOS:000684001600025

STOCHASTIC STABILITY OF CONTINUOUS TIME CONSENSUS PROTOCOLS	SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION												A unified approach to studying convergence and stochastic stability of continuous time consensus protocols (CPs) is presented in this work. Our method applies to networks with directed information flow, both cooperative and noncooperative interactions, networks under weak stochastic forcing, and those whose topology and strength of connections may vary in time. The graph theoretic interpretation of the analytical results is emphasized. We show how the spectral properties, such as algebraic connectivity and total effective resistance, as well as the geometric properties, such as the dimension and the structure of the cycle subspace of the underlying graph, shape stability of the corresponding CPs. In addition, we explore certain implications of spectral graph theory to CP design. In particular, we point out that expanders, sparse highly connected graphs, generate CPs whose performance remains uniformly high when the size of the network grows unboundedly. Similarly, we highlight the benefits of using random versus regular network topologies for CP design. We illustrate these observations with numerical examples and refer to the relevant graph theoretic results.																			0363-0129	1095-7138					2012	50	4					1859	1885		10.1137/100801457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/100801457													WOS:000309999000006

Designing an efficient supply chain network that fulfills the expectation of both business owners and customers and, at the same time, pays attention to environmental protection is becoming a trend in the commercial world. This study proposes a theoretical model incorporating vehicle routing problems (VRPs) into the typical CLSC (closed-loop supply chain) network architecture. This combination assists all operators to act more efficiently in terms of environmental protection and profitability. A mixed-integer-linear-programming model for CLSC network design with fuzzy and random uncertain data is developed to achieve the goals. The parameters of the CLSC network are also programmed using hybrid fuzzy-stochastic mathematical programming. The model is for a single product and a single timeframe. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed mixed-integer-linear-programming (MILP) model. This study also investigated probabilistic possibilities for recourse variables with a trapezoidal fuzzy number using a problem size of four cases. The result indicates that the model performed well in the numerical test, suggesting it can help the operation to be more profitable if this model is implemented in their daily routines.					pedram, ali/J-4604-2015; sorooshian, shahryar/J-4660-2016	sorooshian, shahryar/0000-0001-5336-827X; Abbaspour (ABBAS POUR), Afshin/0000-0002-8501-5767														2071-1050				FEB	2023	15	4							2967	10.3390/su15042967	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15042967													WOS:000941410000001

Each subsystem is composed of a local agent connected to a network unit, which comprise a synchronisation unit and a decision unit. This paper introduces a synchronisation unit that enables the local agents to reach target states autonomously (tracking control) and to execute synchronous state transitions with other subsystems. For designing the decision units, this paper proposes a compositional abstraction method for networked discrete-event systems to obtain a reduced model that describes the cooperative behaviour of the subsystems defined by the synchronous state transitions. If a sequence of synchronous state transitions appears on the subsystem's state trajectory into its target state, then the decision units have to adapt the state trajectory to execute a deadlock-free order of these synchronous state transitions. As the decision units have only local model information, they exchange their reduced abstracted models among each other to locally compose the abstracted overall model. It is proved that each local decision unit can determine the desired execution order of synchronous state transitions as a state sequence in this composed abstracted model.																					978-3-907144-00-8				2019							3976	3983		10.23919/ecc.2019.8795958	http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/ecc.2019.8795958													WOS:000490488304003

In the latter case, the optimization is often non-differentiable and also not very amenable to derivative-free optimization methods. Most methods in use today require sizable computational resources. And if we want networks that additionally satisfy resource constraints, the above challenges are exacerbated because the search must now balance accuracy with certain budget constraints on resources. We formulate this problem as the optimization of a set function - we find that the empirical behavior of this set function often (but not always) satisfies marginal gain and monotonicity principles - properties central to the idea of submodularity. Based on this observation, we adapt algorithms within discrete optimization to obtain heuristic schemes for neural network architecture search, where we have resource constraints on the architecture. This simple scheme when applied on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, identifies resource-constrained architectures with quantifiably better performance than current state-of-the-art models designed for mobile devices. Specifically, we find high-performing architectures with fewer parameters and computations by a search method that is much faster.

Fittest Individual Referenced Differential Evolution Algorithms for Optimization of Water Distribution Networks	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING												Design of water distribution networks (WDNs) is classified as a large combinatorial discrete nonlinear nondeterministic polynomial-hard (NP-hard) optimization problem. The main concerns associated with the optimization of WDNs are related to the nonlinearity of the discharge-head loss relationships for pipes and the discrete nature of pipe sizes. This paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm, called fittest individual referenced differential evolution (FDE), which is significantly more efficient and reliable than other algorithms for optimization of WDN designs. The fundamental structure of FDE is similar to conventional differential evolution (DE), although the functions of the mutation and crossover operators are to exploit good solutions, and explore very different solutions, respectively, and counting and restarting mechanisms are introduced to identify and avoid local optima. These features are beneficial in WDN design because such problems may have an array of local optima that are far from one another, making finding the global optima difficult. The mutation and crossover operators are developed to accelerate convergence and, although the optimal mutation and crossover parameters may vary among networks, the efficiency of the algorithm reduces the need for adaptive parameters or population size. A sensitivity analysis is conducted for algorithm parameters, as well as counting and restarting limits, based on eight evolutionary algorithm (EA) benchmark test problems, and the efficiency of the FDE for solving 2- and 10-dimensional versions of these problems is demonstrated using the most effective values of the parameters and limits. FDE-based optimal designs of four benchmark networks-the Two-loop, Hanoi, and New York WDNs and the Balerma Irrigation Network-show that on average, a minimal number of function evaluations (or hydraulic simulations) is required to reach the best known optimum, which is less than or equal to 600 in all cases for the first three networks. Furthermore, a detailed application of FDE to a large-sized network, that for the City of Farhadgerd, Iran, shows that FDE is significantly more effective than other EAs in terms of its speed of convergence and reliability.																			0887-3801	1943-5487				NOV 1	2019	33	6							04019036	10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000849													WOS:000486180000006

Firstly, both aperiodic denial of service (DoS) attacks and random deception attacks are encountered for investigating system dynamic behavior. Then, a resilient optimized dynamic event-triggered mechanism (RODETM) is proposed for reducing the unnecessary costs of system operation and mitigating the impact caused by attacks. On this basis, the standard NCS is reformulated into a switched system under the mixed attacks. Further, using the piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, average dwell time scheme and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, some sufficient conditions with control design implementation are obtained, which can ensure the exponential stability with the expected prescribed H-infinity performance index of the studied system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by using a numerical simulation with comparative analysis. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Identifying plant mixes for multiple ecosystem service provision in agricultural systems using ecological networks	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Managing agricultural environments in a way that maximises the provision of multiple ecosystem services is a significant challenge in the development of sustainable and secure food systems. Advances in network ecology provide a way forward, particularly in arable landscapes, as they incorporate mutualistic and antagonistic interactions associated with crop production. Here, we present an approach to identify mixes of non-crop plant species that provide multiple ecosystem services while minimising disservices. Genetic algorithms were applied to the Norwood Farm ecological network-a comprehensive dataset of antagonistic and mutualistic species interactions on an organic farm in the United Kingdom. We aimed to show how network analyses can be used to select plants supporting a high diversity of insect pollinators and parasitoids of insect pests, but low diversity of herbivores. Further to this, we wanted to understand the trade-offs in ecosystem service provision associated with conventional management practices that focus on individual ecosystem services. We show that multilayer network analyses can be used to identify mixes of plant species that maximise the species richness of pollinators and parasitoids (natural enemies of insect pests), while minimising the species richness of herbivores. Trade-offs between ecosystem processes were apparent with several plant species associated with a high species richness of both positive (pollinators and parasitoids) and negative (herbivores) functional taxonomic groups. As a result, optimal plant species mixes for individual ecosystem services were different from the mix simultaneously maximising pollination and parasitism of pest insects, while minimising herbivory. Synthesis and applications. Plant mixes designed solely for maximising pollinator species richness are not optimal for the provision of other ecosystem services and disservices (e.g. parasitism of insect pests and herbivory). The method presented here will allow for the design of management strategies that facilitate the provision of multiple ecosystem services. To this end, we provide a protocol for practitioners to develop their own plant mixes suitable for farm-scale management. This avenue of predictive network ecology has the potential to enhance agricultural management, supporting high levels of biodiversity and food production by manipulating ecological networks in specific ways.

This has motivated recent research effort into methods for parameter inference and experiment design for such models. The major difficulty is that such methods usually require one to iteratively solve the chemical master equation that governs the time evolution of the probability distribution of the system. This, however, is rarely possible, and even approximation techniques remain limited to relatively small and simple systems. An alternative explored in this article is to base methods on only some low-order moments of the entire probability distribution. We summarize the theory behind such moment-based methods for parameter inference and experiment design and provide new case studies where we investigate their performance.

The control algorithm consists of discrete Adaptive Critic Design (ACD) in Action Dependant Heuristic Dynamic Programming (ADHDP) configuration, PD controller and a supervisory term, derived from the Lyapunov stability theorem and based on the variable structure systems theory. Adaptive Critic Designs are a group of algorithms that use two independent structures for estimation of optimal value function from Bellman equation and estimation of optimal control law. ADHDP algorithm consists of Actor (ASE - Associate Search Element) that estimates the optimal control law and Critic (ACE - Adaptive Critic Element) that evaluates quality of control by estimation of the optimal value function from Bellman equation. Both structures are realized in a form of Neural Networks (NN). ADHDP algorithm does not require a plant model (the wheeled mobile robot (WMR) model) for ACE or ASE neural network weights update procedure (in contrast with other ACD configurations e.g. Heuristic Dynamic Programming or Dual Heuristic Programming that use the plant model). In presented control algorithm Actor-Critic structure is supported by PD controller and the supervisory term, that guarantee stable implementation of tracking in an initial adaptive critic neural networks learning phase, and robustness in a face of disturbances. Verification of proposed control algorithm was realized on the two-wheeled mobile robot Pioneer-2DX.

A general optimization framework for the design and planning of energy supply chain networks: Techno-economic and environmental analysis	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN												A general spatial optimization framework that relies on the use of a modified state-task network representation for design and planning problems in material and energy supply chain networks is presented. In brief, the proposed optimization framework considers for the tasks and states of the network: (i) the optimal selection and sizing of conversion, transfer and storage technologies, (ii) the capacity expansion for each technology over time, (iii) the inventory levels for storable states, (iv) the quantities of states converted or transferred through tasks, and (v) the optimal energy mix. Several variations of an illustrative design and planning problem of a mixed material and energy supply chain network have been solved effectively to study the trade-off between costs and emissions levels and different emissions regulation policies. A sensitivity analysis study with respect to alternative emissions caps and a multi-objective optimization example considering the conflicting objectives of total cost and emissions are also presented. The case studies showed that a more efficient way for emissions reductions is through regulation and emissions caps rather than increased emissions costs (i.e., 3.3% emissions reductions). Overall, the proposed optimization framework could be used to integrate various types of material and energy supply chain operations using a unified modeling representation towards the more efficient management of such interdependent networks under techno-economic and environmental aspects.

For the purpose of saving limited communication resources between sensor nodes, a novel adaptive dynamic event-triggered mechanism is applied to reduce the frequency of data transmission. Based on the topological structure of sensor networks and the event-triggered condition, a distributed set-membership state estimator is designed to ensure that the states and estimation errors are restricted within the corresponding zonotopes. The appropriate gain matrices of the estimator are selected to minimize the F-radius of the zonotopes, where the augmented estimation error is located at every instant. In order to avoid the huge computational load caused during the estimation iteration process, the reduction operator is introduced to find a compromise between the conservative of the zonotopic estimation results and the complexity of operation. Finally, a numerical example is offered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered zonotopic set-membership state estimation algorithm.																			0278-081X	1531-5878				2024 MAY 3	2024										10.1007/s00034-024-02689-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00034-024-02689-z		MAY 2024											WOS:001217424400002

They can also deliver controlled release agents for sensitive drugs. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of kappa-carrageenan (kcr) concentration (0, 1.5, 3, and 4.5 mg g(-1)) on the morphological and physicochemical properties and release behavior of glucono-delta-lactone (GDL)-induced pinto bean protein aggregate (PBA) gels. RESULTS: When kappa-carrageenan concentration increased from 0 to 1.5 and 3 mg.g(-1), the firmness of the samples increased significantly, by 2.04 and 3.7 fold, respectively (P < 0.05). A compact and homogenous network with considerable strength and maximum water-holding capacity (97.52 +/- 1.17%) was obtained with the addition of 3 mg g(-1) kappa-carrageenan to the gel system. Further increasing the kappa-carrageenan concentration to 4.5 mg g(-1) produced a coarse gel structure with higher storage modulus (G '), firmness (6.30-fold), thermal stability, and entrapment efficiency (85.6%). Depending on the kappa-carrageenan concentration, various microstructures from protein continuous phase to kappa-carrageenan continuous phase were observed. The release test indicated that 70.25% of the loaded curcumin was released in the simulated gastrointestinal tract for pure PBA gels. In contrast, for binary gels containing 4.5 mg g(-1) kappa-carrageenan, curcumin was protected in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and 64.45% of loaded curcumin was delivered to the colon. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that kappa-carrageenan/PBA gels had high entrapment efficiency and could protect curcumin in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The hydrogels are therefore very valuable for colon-targeting delivery purposes. (C) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

By employing a more general type of suitable Lyapunov functional, a set of new generalized sufficient criteria are derived for the global asymptotic stability of delayed neural networks of neutral-type. The proposed stability criteria are independently of the values of the time delays and neutral delays, and they completely rely on some algebraic mathematical relationships involving the values of the elements of the interconnection matrices and the other network parameters. Therefore, it is easy to verify the validity of the obtained results by simply using some algebraic equations representing the stability conditions. A detailed comparison between our proposed results and recently reported corresponding stability results is made, proving that the results given in this paper generalize previously published stability results. A constructive numerical example is also given to demonstrate the applicability of the results of the paper. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Forging pre-form dies optimization using artifi cial neural networks and continuous genetic algorithm	BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												In forging process of complex parts, the raw material cannot be transformed in one forging stage to the final shape; therefore, using one or several pre-form dies would be necessary. An optimal pre-form die should be capable of meeting several design criteria's. Among such design criteria's one can mention the defect-free parts manufacturing with minimum raw materials, minimum plastic strain, minimum force requirement for fulfilling the process as well as filling completely the final die. In this research, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used as a tool for Cartesian path generation. For this reason, at first, several different pre-form dies are produced using random mathematical functions. Then, using finite elements simulation, the optimal die selection criteria's are calculated. An artificial neural network (ANN) is learned by the data obtained from simulation so that it can predict the results of the simulation. The ANN and design criteria's are used as a target function for optimization using continuous GA. Finally, the best pre-form die geometry is calculated using the continuous GA. Also this method is used for H-shape parts to evaluate the method performance. The optimal pre-form die is recommended for the H-shape part and its forging results extracted by the continuous GA. Also, the finite element simulation performed for the optimal die and the obtained results compared to the predicted results of the ANN. The results showed that the obtained optimal model meets the predefined criteria's and this method can be used for optimization of pre-form dies successfully.

A novel time-varying Lyapunov functional is proposed to capture the dynamical characteristic of discrete-time impulsive delayed neural networks (DIDNNs). In conjunction with the convex combination technique, new conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities are established for global exponential stability of DIDNNs. The distinct features of the new stability conditions for DIDNNs are that they are dependent upon the lengths of impulsive intervals but independent of the size of time delay. This paves the way for designing the impulsive controller for impulsive stabilization of DDNNs. The applicability of the developed global exponential stabilization conditions is validated by numerical results.

A relative-formed logarithmic quantizer is adopted and the stochastic fading is characterized as a multiplicative random noise. Assuming that the instantaneous quantization error is accessible, an observer-based output feedback controller is derived by solving two algebraic Riccati equations, together with an inequality involving Mahler measure of the plant. It is shown that stabilizability through a quantized fading actuating channel by output feedback is closely related to both Mahler measure of the plant and the uncertainties generated by the communication channel.

In addition, novel weight update laws are derived for the NNs in the context of event-triggered transmission, i.e., weights are updated only at the triggering instants, hence, aperiodic in nature. The closed loop stability analysis using Lyapunov approach for impulsive dynamical system is carried out to show the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the NN weight estimation errors as well as system states.

H.; Zhang, Yixin; Tan, Jianhong			Optimum Water Quality Monitoring Network Design for Bidirectional River Systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Affected by regular tides, bidirectional water flows play a crucial role in surface river systems. Using optimization theory to design a water quality monitoring network can reduce the redundant monitoring nodes as well as save the costs for building and running a monitoring network. A novel algorithm is proposed to design an optimum water quality monitoring network for tidal rivers with bidirectional water flows. Two optimization objectives of minimum pollution detection time and maximum pollution detection probability are used in our optimization algorithm. We modify the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm and develop new fitness functions to calculate pollution detection time and pollution detection probability in a discrete manner. In addition, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is used to simulate hydraulic characteristics and pollution events based on a hypothetical river system studied in the literature. Experimental results show that our algorithm can obtain a better Pareto frontier. The influence of bidirectional water flows to the network design is also identified, which has not been studied in the literature. Besides that, we also find that the probability of bidirectional water flows has no effect on the optimum monitoring network design but slightly changes the mean pollution detection time.

A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Model for Optimal Operation of Industrial Resource Conservation Networks (RCNs) Under Abnormal Conditions	27TH EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS ENGINEERING, PT A	Computer Aided Chemical Engineering				27th European Symposium on Computer-Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE)	OCT 01-05, 2017	Barcelona, SPAIN					Process integration (P1) techniques have been developed to facilitate the design of efficient and sustainable industrial systems. One large class of applications deals with the synthesis of resource conservation networks (RCNs). However, there is a relatively small body of published work on PI methods for optimizing operations. In the case of RCNs, there may be a need to determine optimal operations in response to process abnormalities that result from internal (e.g., process equipment failure) or external (e.g., climatic events such as drought) disruptions. In this work, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to determine optimal operation of RCNs under abnormal conditions resulting from such disturbances. The model formulation is based on conventional MILP models for grassroots RCN synthesis, hut is modified to address the problem of temporarily reallocating process streams using an existing pipeline network, without additional capital investment. The model assumes that the plant is forced to operate at an abnormal steady state for the duration of the aforementioned disturbance. A modified literature case study on water reuse/recycle is presented to illustrate the use of the model.

The network parameters are assumed to be time-varying but norm-bounded to account for the unavoidable modeling errors and parameter fluctuations. Two different Markov chains with uncertain transition probabilities are utilized to model the feedback regulation delay and the translation delay. We aim to estimate the true concentrations of mRNAs and proteins by designing a non-fragile H-infinity estimator such that the estimation error dynamics is stochastically stable while achieving the prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. By constructing a mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a sufficient condition for the existence of the desired estimator is derived in terms of certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When these LMIs are feasible, the estimator gains can be explicitly given. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We provide a general characterization of the limits and opportunities of different approaches for designing fast mixing dynamics on graphs using the framework of "lifted Markov chains". This common framework allows to prove lower and upper bounds on the mixing behavior of these approaches, depending on a limited set of assumptions on the dynamics.

J	Sela, L; Amin, S				Sela, Lina; Amin, Saurabh			Robust sensor placement for pipeline monitoring: Mixed integer and greedy optimization	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS												Intelligent water systems aided by sensing technologies have been identified as an important mechanism towards ensuring the resilience of urban systems. In this work, we study the problem of sensor placement that is robust to intermittent failures of sensors, i.e. sensor interruptions. We propose robust mixed integer optimization (RMIO) and robust greedy approximation (RGA) solution approaches. The underlying idea of both approaches is to promote solutions that achieve multiple detectability of events, such that these events remain detectable even when some sensors are interrupted. Additionally, we apply a previously proposed greedy approximation approach for solving the robust submodular function optimization (RSFO) problem. We compare scalability of these approaches and the quality of the solutions using a set of real water-networks. Our results demonstrate that considering sensor interruptions in the design stage improves sensor network performance. Importantly, we ford that although the detection performances of RMIO and RGA approaches are comparable, RMIO generally has better performance than RGA, and is scalable to large-scale networks. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that RMIO and RGA approaches tend to outperform the RSFO approach.

However, the traditional picking robot grabbing work method has a long grabbing cycle. This paper proposes a continuous picking scheme for yellow peaches. First, we proposed a comparison between the calculation method of the continuous picking method and the traditional picking method. It provided a yellow peach-picking robot and a continuous picking end effector. We designed and improved the YOLOv5s model, adding model clipping, ODconv, Global Context Networks and ELAN methods. The best model can be obtained through multiple ablation experiments. We proposed a collision-free continuous picking path (CPP) by Volume variables and a threedimensional Gaussian kernel. It can be applied to the yellow peach continuous-picking robot. After the improved YOLOv5s network, the MAP and model size reached mAP, and the model size reached 96 % and 3.54 MB. Compared with the original and improved networks, the improved network parameters were reduced by 75.5 %, and the mAP was increased by 4.6 %, reducing the deployment cost. In the simulation experiment, the non-collision continuous picking algorithm was compared with the planning method under the traditional picking method. The continuous picking path is 29.56 % of the original path, the theoretical non-collision rate reaches 96.6 %, the actual non-collision rate is 91.6 %, and the picking success rate is 80 %. The scheme can realize continuous picking of yellow peaches. This scheme provides an essential reference for the continuous picking of fruits.																			0168-1699	1872-7107				NOV	2023	214								108273	10.1016/j.compag.2023.108273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2023.108273		OCT 2023											WOS:001088345300001

A novel implementation of HGN for swarm robotic behaviour control	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												Simple rule-based robot behaviours, such as those utilised for swarming robots, typically excel in only the niche conditions for which they were designed. Behaviour selection allows robots to switch between these specialised behaviours in accordance with the observed conditions. This paper explores the use of a novel form of Hierarchical Graph Neurons (HGN) for such behaviour selection within a swarm of robotic agents. This new HGN is called Robotic-HGN (R-HGN) as it allows pattern matching of mixed datasets of robot observations. R-HGN matches said patterns to labelled environments and allows appropriate robot behaviours to be utilised throughout an operation in a 'society of mind' approach to task flexibility in robots. This approach is novel to the HGN field as it expands the application beyond discrete categorical data inputs. Additionally, this research is novel to the field of robotic swarming as it explores a new method to temporal agent diversity for overcoming localised environment challenges. This R-HGN for behaviour selection is validated against individual behaviour implementations and a random behaviour selection. The comparison is made via statistical distribution of swarm fitnesses in multiple instances of a non-trivial swarming task. From this comparison R-HGN is found to enable appropriate behaviour selection in both environments known and unknown a priori, resulting in a median swarm performance improvement of up to 389%. Finally, in environments prior observed, the R-HGN environment prediction one-versus-all accuracy is up to 99.1% and F1 scores reach a maximum of 97.15%.

The 2D-metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have obtained great importance owing to the potential to promote electrochemically active sites, which enhance the charge storage capability. It refers to a brand-new class of 2D materials that can offer regular active sites and discrete open channels. Still, only a few reports have described that 2D MOFs possess remarkable features to enhance the performance of energy storage devices. In this review, we have briefly discussed the structure, surface chemistry and synthesis with the extent of energy storage applications of 2D MOFs in supercapacitors, batteries, and supercapattery. Further, several synthesis methodologies are also discussed in detail, which is most appropriate for designing 2D MOFs-based energy storage devices. Furthermore, the most essential and core part of this review explained the use of 2D MOFs as an electrode in devices with deep insight into the charge storage mechanisms, stability, and compatibility with electrolyte solutions. In conclusion, but most considerably, the future perspective delivers an inclusive thought and new direction for future research opportunities to apply this family of materials in energy storage applications. Due to remarkable properties such as rapid charge and discharge, extraordinary power density, and prolonged life cycles, these 2D-MOFs are better for energy applications.

CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												Spatial confinement in nanostructures is of critical importance in the fabrication of tubular and hollow spherical objects using void formation via the Kirkendall effect. For both core-shell nanowires and nanospheres, generated vacancies are trapped within an area that is confined either in two (nanowires) or all three (nanospheres) spatial dimensions. When the void formation is extended to multilayered thin films where only one dimension (thickness) is in the nanoscale and the other dimensions are infinitely extended, the final morphology of the formed voids can be significantly different. Using a multilayered system consisting of alternating layers of ZnO and Al2O3 grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD), we investigate the effects of annealing temperature, annealing duration, layer thickness, polycrystallinity, grain size, and reaction space on the solid-state diffusion process and final morphology of the produced Kirkendall voids. As opposed to single-crystal ZnO nanowires coated with an amorphous Al2O3 shell, which involves only a one-way transfer of ZnO into Al2O3, polycrystalline ZnO layers in the multilayered films also cause diffusion of Al2O3 into ZnO layers via grain boundary diffusion. Temperature treatment at 700 degrees C generally yielded layered voids for multilayered films with thin component sublayers. This morphology was well-preserved even at 800 degrees C. In contrast, partially continuous nanogap morphologies were formed for multilayered films with thick sublayers at 700 degrees C. However, only interlaced voids were produced at 800 degrees C in this case, because of grain boundary migration induced oriented attachment. The mechanisms revealed here allow precise fabrication and design of porous multilayered composite films with controlled void morphology.

The measurement missing phenomenon is characterized via a random variable obeying the Bernoulli stochastic distribution. Moreover, due to bandwidth limitations, the measurement output is quantized using a logarithmic quantizer and then transmitted to the filter. Further, the output measurements are affected by sensor saturation since the communication links between the system and the filter are unreliable and is described by sector nonlinearities. The objective of this work is to design a quantized resilient filter that guarantees not only the stochastic stability of the augmented filtering error system but also a prespecified level of H-infinity performance. Sufficient conditions for the existence of desired filter are established with the aid of proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequality approach together with stochastic analysis theory.

As a first effort, the redundant channels are considered to use in the data transmission to strive against the fragility of networks commonly configured by a single channel in the communication networks subject to quantization and randomly occurring packet dropouts. By constructing a Lur'e-type Lyapunov function interconnected with a cone-bounded nonlinearity, the filtering performance analysis for the underlying systems is carried out first. Then, a new class of distributed filters, which can be used to reflect the mismatching characteristic of modes jumping between the target plants and the proposed filters, is designed such that the filtering error system is stochastically stable and achieves a prescribed average H-8 performance index. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed filtering scheme.					zheng, wei/IQT-9639-2023; WU, ZHEN/GRN-7688-2022; Zhang, Lixian/G-3614-2014	WU, ZHEN/0000-0001-8719-057X; Zheng, Wei Xing/0000-0002-0572-5938													0278-0046	1557-9948				MAR	2016	63	3					1876	1885		10.1109/TIE.2015.2499169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2499169													WOS:000370875300053

Robust stabilization and <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> control for discrete-time stochastic genetic regulatory networks with time delays	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS												This paper presents some novel results on robust stabilization and H-infinity control design for a class of uncertain discrete-time stochastic genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) with time-varying delays. The GRNs under consideration are subject to stochastic noise, time-varying, and norm bounded parameter uncertainties. By constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional that contains some novel triple summation terms, we propose a state feedback gene controller to guarantee that the considered GRN is mean-square asymptotically stable about its equilibrium point for all admissible uncertainties. The other issue is to design a H-infinity feedback gene controller so that the GRN is robustly stable with a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level for all admissible uncertainties and for all delays to satisfy both the lower bound and upper bound of the interval time-varying delay. The obtained conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily verified via the LMI toolbox.

Two specific architectures are examined: (i) quantum coupled logic in which Boolean logic functions are implemented by quantum mechanical spin-spin interactions between single electrons in arrays of quantum dots, and (ii) quantum neuromorphic networks that exploit the complex spatial and temporal evolution of discrete charge in an ensemble of non-linearly interacting quantum dots to elicit collective computational behavior. The first class of circuits includes combinational and sequential digital systems. Both logically irreversible elements such as half-adders, S-R flip-flops, shift registers, ring counters, etc., and reversible Feynman gates for quantum computation have been designed in this paradigm. These circuits can be endowed with the required ''unidirectional'' (non-reciprocal) character that previous (flawed) designs of similar circuits lacked. The second class of circuits comprises discrete Hopfield networks which utilize single electron tunneling events in arrays of metallic islands to perform neuromorphic computation. They can solve NP-complete optimization problems (such as the traveling salesman problem), produce associative memory effects and also exhibit rudimentary image-processing capability.

To generate the data, 168 experiments were conducted with mixing time (sec), cohesion (30 min) kg.cm, cohesion (60 min) kg. cm, set time (sec), wet track abrasion loss (g/m(2)) as an additives for the design of alternative fillers such as Copper Slag, Fly Ash and High Calcium Fly Ash. Training and testing of feature vector which were formed after conducting experiment was fed into machine learning regression models for prediction of composition of fillers. Support vector machine with polynomial, radial basis function and PUK kernel, Artificial neural network with RBF kernel and Isotonic regression models were considered in the present study. Machine learning regression models were evaluated using three parameters Correlation coefficient, Spearman rho's and Mean absolute error. Excellent agreement between regression models and experimental results observed.

Efficient energy management of hybrid electric vehicle is challenging owning to its enormous search space, multitudinous control variables and complicated driving conditions. Most existing methods apply discretization to approximate the continuous optimum in real driving conditions, which results in relatively low performance with the discretization error and curse of dimensionality. We introduce a novel energy management strategy with a deep reinforcement learning framework Actor-Critic to address these challenges. Actor-Critic uses a deep neural network, named as actor network, to directly output continuous control signals. Another deep neural network, named as critic network, evaluates the control signals generated by the actor network. The actor and critic neural network are trained by reinforcement learning from self-play in a continuous action space. Several comprehensive experiments are conducted in this paper, the proposed method surpasses discretization-based strategies by directly optimizing in the continuous space, which improves energy management performance while blackucing computation load. The simulation results indicate that the AC achieve the optimal energy distribution in comparison with the discretization-based strategies, especially surpassing the existing baseline DP by 5.5%, 2.9%, 9.5% in CTUDC, WVUCITY and WVUSUB in one-tenth of the computational cost.

By combining event-triggered control with intermittent control, an intermittent event-triggered control strategy is proposed, which only focuses on events during control time. Consequently, compared with some existing event-triggered control strategies, it greatly reduces the amount of samplings and saves control costs. Based on the fuzzy intermittent event-triggered controller designed in this article, two event-triggering mechanisms are proposed to determine the trigger instants. In this context, some easily testified algebraic conditions are obtained for the exponential stabilization of the state-dependent switched fuzzy neural networks with mixed delays. In addition, a positive lower bound for the inter-event time is given. The results of theoretical analysis are verified through a simulation example.

However, the extra degree of freedom from the neural architecture design makes the design space much larger: it is not only about designing the hardware architecture but also codesigning the neural architecture to fit the hardware architecture. It is difficult for human engineers to exhaust the design space by heuristics. We propose design automation techniques for architecting efficient neural networks given a target hardware platform. We investigate automatically designing specialized and fast models, auto channel pruning, and auto mixed-precision quantization. We demonstrate that such learning-based, automated design achieves superior performance and efficiency than the rule-based human design. Moreover, we shorten the design cycle by 200x than previous work, so that we can afford to design specialized neural network models for different hardware platforms.

J	Gao, A; Wang, Q; Liang, W; Ding, ZG				Gao, Ang; Wang, Qi; Liang, Wei; Ding, Zhiguo			Game Combined Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for UAV Assisted Offloading	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY												Air ground integrated mobile cloud computing (MCC) provides unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) the capability to act as an aerial relay with more flexibility and resilience. In the cloud computing architecture, the data generated by ground users (GUs) can be offloaded to the remote server for fast processing. However, the heterogeneity of mobile tasks makes the data size distributed among GUs unbalanced. Besides, the energy efficiency of UAVs movement should be carefully considered for sustainable flight and obstacle avoidance. In general, such a joint trajectory issue can hardly be formulated as a convex optimization in unpredictable and dynamic environments. This paper proposes a potential game combined multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize multiple UAVs' trajectory with the consideration of GUs' offloading delay, energy efficiency as well as obstacle avoidance system. In specific, we first model the issue as a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINP), in which the service assignment between multi-user and multi-UAV is solved by potential game. The convergence to a Nash Equilibrium (NE) can be achieved by distributive service assignment update with infinite iteration. Then, we optimize the trajectory with obstacle avoidance at each UAV by MADDPG approach, which has a great advantage of centralized-training and decentralized-execution to reduce the global synchronized communication overhead. UAVs movement can be optimized in continuity rather than other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches generating discrete simple actions. Experiments demonstrate the proposed game-combined learning algorithm can minimize the offloading delay, enhance UAVs' energy efficiency and avoid the obstacles at the same time.																			0018-9545	1939-9359				DEC	2021	70	12					12888	12901		10.1109/TVT.2021.3121281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3121281													WOS:000731151400050

A Deep Learning Framework for Transforming Image Reconstruction Into Pixel Classification	IEEE ACCESS												A deep learning framework is presented that transforms the task of MR image reconstruction from randomly undersampled k-space data into pixel classification. A DL network was trained to remove incoherent undersampling artifacts from MR images. The underlying, fully sampled, target image was represented as a discrete quantized image. The quantization step enables the design of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify each pixel in the input image to a discrete quantized level. The reconstructed image quality of the proposed DL classification model was compared with conventional compressed sensing (CS) and a DL regression model. The reconstructed images using the DL classification model outperformed the state-of-the-art compressed sensing and DL regression models with a similar number of parameters assessed using quantitative measures. The experiments reveal that the proposed deep learning method is robust to noise and is able to reconstruct high-quality images in low SNR scenarios where conventional CS reconstructions and DL regression networks perform poorly. A generic design framework for transforming MR image reconstruction into pixel classification is developed. The proposed method can be easily incorporated into other DL-based image reconstruction methods.					Chen, Zhaolin/B-7898-2010; Shah, N. Jon/H-5849-2013	Chen, Zhaolin/0000-0002-0173-6090; Shah, N.

Both, the distribution and assignment stages are incorporated in an interlaced way with a dynamic behavior along a specific time horizon. In the proposed model, the individual route choice is dynamically determined as consequence of facilities attractiveness and network congestion. Therefore, in contrast with other simulation approaches, it does not require the usual origin-destination trip matrices to describe the transportation demand or the specification of different paths to be followed by visitors. This modeling approach turns out to be very appropriate for the simulation of these big exhibition events where each visitor usually has multiple and a priori unordered destination choices after entering the scenario. The main aim of the proposed model is to obtain measures of pavilions occupation, queue sizes and links density at the various facilities rather than the exhaustive tracking of individual movements or the precise description of the interaction between different entities. So, the use of pure microscopic continuous models is not needed. This approach can be viewed as a macroscopic simulation based on individual route-choice behavior of entities (microscopic level). As illustration, here we show how the model works when dealing with the pedestrian mobility in the International Exhibition of Zaragoza held in 2008, where it was used as a planning and operation analysis tool in the preliminary stages.

The crystal structure of 2 features unusual two-dimensional networks of ttf units which extend in the a and c directions. Each ttf sheet contains stacked trimers of ttf units, which propagate along the a direction, and bridging ttf units, which lie between the ttf stacks approximately orthogonally to the ttf units within the trimers. The trimers are linked along the c direction via short S ... S contacts (3.56 Angstrom) with these bridging ttf units.

Energy consumption is always a major concern in the research field of wireless sensor network. Thus, data aggregation schemes emerged and were deployed for prolonging network lifetime by reducing data transmitted within the network. Meanwhile, along with the wide application of the data aggregation schemes, the security issues of data aggregation have been increasingly drawing attention and the designing of secure data aggregation scheme is becoming a hot spot. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient secure data aggregation scheme, ESMART: energy-efficient slice-mix-aggregate based on the technique of data slicing and mixing.

With previous traffic volume forecasting model, traffic agencies could make relevant decisions on traffic managements and controls. In the past decades, many advanced models have been proposed and achieved a significant improvement in forecasting. However, multiple-step ahead traffic forecasting has not attracted its deserved attention. In this paper, we proposed a Gaussian Mixed Model embedded Back Propagation network (GMM-BP) to implement multiple-step ahead traffic forecasting. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have designed a numerical experiment using PeMS dataset and compared its performance to single Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM) and Back Propagation (BP) network with the Mean Relative Deviation (MRD) criterion and "acceptance region". The results show that our proposed method in this paper outperforms single GMM and BP network, and especially in multiple-step ahead traffic volume forecasting. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The filter structure includes both measurement update terms and a consensus term on the state estimates, and it is assumed to be asynchronously switched with the network topology. The time-delay approach is employed to stability and H-infinity performance analysis of the filtering error system. The filter gains can be obtained based on the feasible solutions to a set of linear matrix inequalities.

J	Gastellu-Etchegorry, JP; Gascon, F; Estève, P				Gastellu-Etchegorry, JP; Gascon, F; Estève, P			An interpolation procedure for generalizing a look-up table inversion method	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The inversion of physically based reflectance models is increasingly efficient for extracting vegetation variables from remote sensing images. It requires a vegetation reflectance model and an inversion method that are accurate and efficient. Usually, the complexity of reflectance models implies to use specific inversion methods (e.g., look-up table and neural network). Unfortunately, these methods are valid only for the view-sun directions for which they are designed. A developed look-up table based inversion method avoids this limitation: it generalizes any look-up table for any view-sun direction, and more generally for any input parameter value. It uses a look-up table made of c(i) coefficients of any analytical expression h that fits a set of reflectance values simulated by the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. Interpolation on coefficients ci allows h to give reflectance values for any input parameter value. We settled some options of the inversion method with sensitivity studies: tree covers are simulated with 4-tree scenes, expression h has six coefficients c(i) and the interpolation is the continuous first derivative interpolation method. Moreover, the robustness of the inversion method was validated. The ability to generalize a took-up table for any view-sun direction was successfully tested with the inversion of SPOT images of Fontainebleau (France) forest. LAI maps proved to be as accurate (i.e., RMSE approximate to 1.3) as those obtained with classical relationships that are calibrated with in situ LAI measurements. Here, the advantage of our inversion method was to avoid this calibration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Many error detection techniques for FFT algorithms have been reported, but fault tolerance issues for other important transforms have not been addressed as vigorously. A general design and analysis approach for all fast unitary transforms is presented. It relies on fundamental linear algebra methods coupled with associated dual space representations that are natural descriptions of real parity values. Basic output error patterns from single computational errors are used to define an equal-sized group of dual space basis vectors on which practical parity weighting functions maybe evaluated. An iterative design approach leads to complete single error detection capabilities.

However, in a mixed traffic flow environment where both human driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs exist, the platoon intensity is significantly impacted by the stochastic order of the HDVs and CAVs (i.e., the fleet sequence). Therefore, the link capacity involves a large uncertainty even under the same HDV and CAV flow. This uncertain link capacity can cause a large variation in network flow. In the literature, traffic assignment models for mixed traffic flows of HDVs and CAVs are developed based on expected link capacity models, in which the computed link capacity is deterministic for given HDV and CAV flows. These models ignore the impacts of uncertain link capacity on the network performance and network flow distribution, which can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the corresponding planning strategies. To address this problem, this study proposes a worst-case mixed traffic assignment model. It aims to compute the worst network performance and corresponding equilibrium flow that may occur due to uncertain link capacity. The worst-case mixed traffic assignment is formulated as a bilevel programming problem, where the low-level problem is a variational inequality problem presented to compute the equilibrium results based on a fixed link capacity while the upper-level problem is to find the optimal input for all link capacities within their ranges to minimize the network performance. The partition-based norm relaxed method of the feasible direction solution algorithm is proposed to solve the bilevel worst-case mixed traffic assignment problem. A numerical application shows that the uncertain link capacity has drastic effects on the network flows and network performance, and the proposed algorithm can effectively and efficiently solve the bilevel worst-case mixed traffic assignment problem to compute the worst-case network equilibrium flows and network performance. These results can help traffic managers design robust planning strategies to ensure a minimum level of network performance under the impacts of uncertain link capacity.

We refer to this configuration as a feedback network. To reflect practical reality, a cost function is considered to constrain the controller, and then the constrained controller design problem is transformed into a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem. In addition, when a single controller cannot be found under the constraint, a switching controller is designed by a Lyapunov function method. The convex combination technique is used to design the synchronizing switching signal between the candidate controllers, and its coefficients are given by the solution of a convex optimization problem.

Finding a logical topology and a routing scheme making optimum use of network resources is a challenging task. A complication is that the survivability of AON has become an important issue. In designing a fault tolerant WDM network, the primary lightpaths, the corresponding backup lightpaths, and the routing scheme have to be determined simultaneously in such a way that network resources are used in an optimum manner. In this paper we first develop an Integer Linear Formulation (ILP) for designing a fault-tolerant logical using shared path protection. The objective is to design a survivable logical topology and a routing over that topology in such a way that the overall congestion is minimized. This formulation can be solved to give us the optimum logical topology for small WDM networks. However, for larger networks, this approach becomes infeasible due the large number of constraints and integer variables. For such networks, we outline a simple heuristic algorithm to find a feasible logical topology.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	0-8194-5130-4				2003	5247						242	253		10.1117/12.511158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.511158													WOS:000186148800025

This study presents a robust H-infinity control design approach for a class of uncertain discrete-time stochastic neural networks with time-varying delays. The neural network under consideration is subject to time-varying and norm bounded parameter uncertainties. For the robust stabilisation problem, a state feedback controller is designed to ensure global robust stability of the closed-loop form of neural network about its equilibrium point for all admissible uncertainties. In addition, to the requirement of the global robust stability, a prescribed H-infinity performance level for all delays to satisfy both the lower bound and upper bound of the interval time-varying delay is required to be obtained. Through construction of a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a robust H-infinity control scheme is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The controller gains can be derived by solving a set of LMIs.

Based on the embeddings, we cluster standard cells into groups and create the placement guidance. By adding the placement guidance to a commercial place-and-route tool, the tool will strive to avoid the fragmentation of standard cells with dense connections in the placement stage. Experimental results show that our placement guidance generation methodology helps the commercial tool reduce 26% routing overflow and 65% design rule violations for the test cases.																			1948-3287		979-8-3503-3475-3				2023							90	96		10.1109/ISQED57927.2023.10129328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISQED57927.2023.10129328													WOS:001013619400013
J	Gong, H; Xu, WN; Sun, WJ; Xu, K				Gong, Hua; Xu, Wanning; Sun, Wenjuan; Xu, Ke			Multi-Objective Flexible Flow Shop Production Scheduling Problem Based on the Double Deep Q-Network Algorithm	PROCESSES												In this paper, motivated by the production process of electronic control modules in the digital electronic detonators industry, we study a multi-objective flexible flow shop scheduling problem. The objective is to find a feasible schedule that minimizes both the makespan and the total tardiness. Considering the constraints imposed by the jobs and the machines throughout the manufacturing process, a mixed integer programming model is formulated. By transforming the scheduling problem into a Markov decision process, the agent state features and the actions are designed based on the processing status of the machines and the jobs, along with heuristic rules. Furthermore, a reward function based on the optimization objectives is designed. Based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) algorithm is designed to solve the scheduling problem by incorporating the target network, the dueling network, and the experience replay buffer. The D3QN algorithm is compared with heuristic rules, the genetic algorithm (GA), and the optimal solutions generated by Gurobi. The ablation experiments are designed. The experimental results demonstrate the high performance of the D3QN algorithm with the target network and the dueling network proposed in this paper. The scheduling model and the algorithm proposed in this paper can provide theoretical support to make the production plan of electronic control modules reasonable and improve production efficiency.

Bradykinesia Is Driven by Cumulative Beta Power During Continuous Movement and Alleviated by Gabaergic Modulation in Parkinson's Disease	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY												Spontaneous and "event-related" motor cortex oscillations in the beta (15-30 Hz) frequency range are well-established phenomena. However, the precise functional significance of these features is uncertain. An understanding of the specific function is of importance for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), where attenuation of augmented beta throughout the motor network coincides with functional improvement. Previous research using a discrete movement task identified normalization of elevated spontaneous beta and postmovement beta rebound following GABAergic modulation. Here, we explore the effects of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A modulator, zolpidem, on beta power during the performance of serial movement in 17 (15M, 2F; mean age, 66 +/- 6.3 years) PD patients, using a repeated-measures, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-control design. Motor symptoms were monitored before and after treatment, using time-based Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale measurements and beta oscillations in primary motor cortex (M1) were measured during a serial-movement task, using magnetoencephalography. We demonstrate that a cumulative increase in M1 beta power during a 10-s tapping trial is reduced following zolpidem, but not placebo, which is accompanied by an improvement in movement speed and efficacy. This work provides a clear mechanism for the generation of abnormally elevated beta power in PD and demonstrates that perimovement beta accumulation drives the slowing, and impaired initiation, of movement. These findings further indicate a role for GABAergic modulation in bradykinesia in PD, which merits further exploration as a therapeutic target.

J	Ceccon, F; Misener, R				Ceccon, Francesco; Misener, Ruth			Solving the pooling problem at scale with extensible solver GALINI	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This paper presents a Python library to model pooling problems, a class of network flow problems with many engineering applications. The library automatically generates a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic optimization problem from a given network structure. The library additionally uses the network structure to build 1) a convex linear relaxation of the non-convex quadratic program and 2) a mixed-integer linear restriction of the problem. We integrate the pooling network library with GALINI, an open-source extensible global solver for quadratic optimization. We demonstrate GALINI's extensible characteristics by using the pooling library to develop two GALINI plug-ins: 1) a cut generator plug-in that adds valid inequalities in the GALINI cut loop and 2) a primal heuristic plug-in that uses the mixed-integer linear restriction. We test GALINI on large scale pooling problems and show that, thanks to the good upper bound provided by the mixed-integer linear restriction and the good lower bounds provided by the convex relaxation, we obtain optimality gaps that are competitive with Gurobi 9.1 on the largest problem instances.

As a theoretical foundation, limit state analysis uses a set of bound (limit) theorems. Limit theorems are based on the law of conservation of energy and are used for a direct definition of the limit state function for failure by plastic collapse or by inadaptation. This study proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) model in order to approximate the residual bending moment, limit and the incremental failure force of continuous beams. The neural network structure applied here is a radial-Gaussian network architecture (RGIN) and complementary training procedure. This structure is intended to be used for civil engineering purposes and it is demonstrated on the example of the two-span continuous beam loaded in the middle of the span that the limit and the incremental failure force can be obtained using neural network approach with sufficient precision and is especially suitable in analysis when some of the model parameters are variable.

The mathematical formulation in weak forms that readily induces process dynamic expressions is established under the framework of continuous time representation, in which a rigorous dynamic model of a tank is embedded. The freshwater consumption and the regeneration flow rates are minimized by a two-stage optimization approach. The integration of the batch water-using system highlights fixed regeneration flow rates and transitional behaviors from the start-Lip phase to steady state in multiple batch cycles. Optimal network structures and evolution characteristics of residual water and contaminant concentrations in buffer tanks can be achieved through solutions to the nonlinear programming problems (NLP). Four scenarios, including truly batch and semicontinuous water-using systems in both multiproduct and multipurpose batch plants, are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.																			0888-5885					DEC 16	2009	48	24					10924	10940		10.1021/ie9000053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie9000053													WOS:000272396300024

However, practical applications are hindered by the lower conductivity and poor interfacial stability. Here, we propose a strategy to construct a three-dimensional (3D) fiber network of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) with continuous ion transport pathways were fabricated by filling a PEO polymer matrix in fibers containing interconnected MOFs. This 3D fiber network provides a fast Li+ transport path and effectively improves the ionic conductivity (1.36 x 10-4 S center dot cm-1, 30 degrees C). In addition, the network of interconnected MOFs not only effectively traps the anions, but also provides sufficient mechanical strength to prevent the growth of Li dendrites. Benefiting from the advantages of structural design, the CSEs stabilize the Li/electrolyte interface and extend the cycle life of the Li-symmetric cells to 3000 h. The assembled SSLMBs exhibit excellent cycling performance at both room and high temperatures. In addition, the constructed pouch cells can provide an areal capacity of 0.62 mA center dot h center dot cm-2, which can still operate under extreme conditions. This work provides a new strategy for the design of CSEs with continuous structure and stable operation of SSLMBs.

A pseudospatial spectrum estimation network based on a convolutional neural network is proposed to estimate the number of electromagnetic radiation sources, their direction of arrival, and the mixing matrix. A new loss function is designed as an optimization criterion for estimating the separation matrix. To ensure generalization, both simulated and measured datasets are used to train the proposed network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed separation method outperforms existing source separation techniques in terms of correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and running time. Importantly, it exhibits strong performance in underdetermined cases, as well as in overdetermined or determined cases.																			2671-7255	2671-7263				NOV	2023	23	6					521	529		10.26866/jees.2023.6.r.197	http://dx.doi.org/10.26866/jees.2023.6.r.197													WOS:001125273100011

Therefore, to remove the moire<acute accent> patterns, we propose a multilevel wavelet nested UNet++ demoire<acute accent>ing residual network called MUNet++. Unlike these methods based on the RGB domain, our method is performed in the frequency domain. The multilevel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) are elegantly embedded into the UNet++ encoder-decoder structure and transformed to the multilevel frequency domain, which captures more moire<acute accent> features and preserves details of the image. In addition, we design a dual branch efficient pixel fusion attention module (DBEPFAM) that combines multiscale information, channel attention and the proposed pixel attention fusion module (PAFM) to improve the representation of features. In the network layer, a simple nonlinear unit (NU) is designed and embedded in the middle of the network layer to improve the representation capability of the network. Experimental results on two public datasets show that MUNet++ can effectively remove the moire<acute accent> patterns and outperform existing state-of-the-art techniques.																			0141-9382	1872-7387				JUL	2024	83								102741	10.1016/j.displa.2024.102741	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.displa.2024.102741													WOS:001240432200001

In MLR networks, end-to-end Jightpaths can be established with the desired line rate; requiring advanced modulation formats for higher data rates. However, along the route, the signals experience different physical layer impairments (PLIs), and their quality also worsens. The transmission signal quality is affected by the launch power, which must be high for lesser noise at the receiver, and must also be low, such that the PLIs do not start to distort the signal. Further, higher launch power also disrupts the existing Jightpath and its neighbours. We propose a weighted strategy for provisioning PLI-aware (PLI-A) lightpaths in MLR networks. Through the simulations, we compare and demonstrate that the proposed strategy demonstrates better performances than our previously proposed algorithm (i.e. PLI-Average (PLI-A )), and existing approaches.

The physical network design problem lies in determining the location of the suburban stations and suburban section tracks to be newly constructed, by considering the coordination of the existing urban rail network. The service network design problem aims to decide the newly operated service routes and the corresponding frequency and timetable of vehicles running on these service routes. We formulate the studied problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which minimises the weighted sum of the construction cost, operation costs, and generalised cost of passengers. Many practical requirements are considered to ensure the attractiveness of the computed solutions. A variable neighbourhood search-based (VNS-based) heuristic is designed to efficiently solve instances with different scales, including hypothetical instances and a practical-size real-world instance generated based on the Chongqing metropolitan in China.

Here, the continuous controllers are originally designed by using the control theory in the linear time-invariant (LTI) continuous-tune setting, while the neural algorithms approximate the input/output behavior of the continuous controllers through deep learning. Then, stability problem of the hybrid feedback system is formulated as that of a corresponding LTI feedback system subject to nonlinear perturbation in term of learning error. Stability conditions in bounded-input/bounded-output (BIBO) are proved. In general, when stability robustness is concerned, the suggested stability conditions show that the learning error should be as small as possible. To illustrate the theoretical results, a continuous-time PID controller being replaced with a deep belief network (DBN) controller in a DC-motor system is stimulated. That is, the input/output time responses of the PID controller are used as the training data and target data, respectively, for creating the DBN controller. This yields an DC-motor feedback system based on DBN-driving control strategy. Numerical simulations and comparisons of the DC-motor system under the PID controller and under the suggested DBN one validate the expected performances and high efficacy.

It is assumed that state and control signals transmit through an unreliable communication channel, where packet dropout and input delay occur simultaneously. The main contributions are twofold. First, we obtain the optimal LQR controller, which is a linear function of the optimal state estimator, with the feedback gain based on a standard difference Riccati equation. It is noted that the state estimator and the controller can be calculated separately. Second, a necessary and sufficient condition for the mean-square stabilization is derived.

A new active learning approach for global optimization of atomic clusters	THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY ACCOUNTS												In catalysis, an accurate structural elucidation of molecules, atomic clusters, nanoparticles and solid surfaces is required to understand chemical processes. Therefore, an efficient and automatic structure determination for these systems is of great benefit since it requires a global search within huge chemical spaces. In this work, we propose a new active learning (AL) method intended for atomic clusters that uses different supervised machine learning techniques and their uncertainties to decide the promising non-observed (virtual) structures to be evaluated from quantum calculations. The method was developed for structural elucidation of (I) clusters where all atomic coordinates are allowed to change in a continuous chemical space and (II) doped ones where the atoms exchange in a sufficiently rigid structure, thus, a discrete search space where all cluster descriptors are known. Particularly for case I, a genetic algorithm operator was used to create the unknown virtual structures (and then their descriptors) from the observed ones to improve the performance of the AL search. The proposed AL was applied to the global optimization of heteronuclear (Al4Si7 and 4Al@Si-11) and homonuclear (Na-20) clusters using self-consistent charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB), where a new repulsion parameter was developed to reproduce isomers evaluated from high-level calculations. The performance of the Gaussian process and artificial neural network algorithms was evaluated together with several uncertainty quantification methods: from Gaussian process, K-fold cross-validation and nonparametric bootstrap (BS) resampling. The efficiency of the AL was compared to conventional global optimization methods, such as random search and a genetic algorithm.

J	Li, QW; Savachkin, A				Li, Qingwei; Savachkin, Alex			Reliable distribution networks design with nonlinear fortification function	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE												Distribution networks have been facing an increased exposure to the risk of unpredicted disruptions causing significant economic losses. The current literature features a limited number of studies considering fortification of network facilities. In this paper, we develop a reliable uncapacitated fixed-charge location model with fortification to support the design of distribution networks. The model considers heterogeneous facility failure probabilities, one layer of supplier backup, and facility fortification within a finite budget. Facility reliability improvement is modelled as a nonlinear function of fortification investment. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer programming model proven to be [GRAPHICS] -hard. A Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristic algorithm is developed and its computational efficiency for solving large-scale problems is demonstrated.																			0020-7721	1464-5319				MAR 11	2016	47	4					805	813		10.1080/00207721.2014.906682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2014.906682													WOS:000361215300005

It first introduces a novel concept - segment - defined as a pair of ordered ports served by one shipping line and subsequently develops a mixed-integer linear programming model for the proposed problem. Extensive numerical experiments based on realistic Asia-Europe-Oceania shipping operations show that the proposed model can be efficiently solved by CPLEX for real-case problems. They also demonstrate the potential for large cost-savings over pure hub-and-spoke or pure multi-port-calling network, or network without considering empty container repositioning.

The main purpose of this paper is to design a robust H-infinity filter, which makes the filtering error system stochastic stable and satisfies the given H-infinity performance index.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the design of a suitable neural network model to control the grain dryer more effectively. First, the operating mechanism of a continuous grain dryer and the principle of the heat and mass transfer that can be used in the process of grain drying was analyzed before an intelligent control system was designed accordingly. Second, an intelligent control system based on the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) was developed. The BPNN was the optimal model selected based on a series of comparative test results. According to the BPNN prediction of the moisture content of dried rice, the system could adjust the rate of grain discharge of the dryer, and then control the drying process accurately. Finally, the neural network control model was simulated using computer simulation technology, and was optimized by comparing analysis results with experimental results. The results showed that the optimized intelligent control system using BPNN has the advantage of strong stability and good noise handling, and could have great potential for future implementation studies.

J	Abdelrahim, M; Almakhles, D; Mabrok, M				Abdelrahim, Mahmoud; Almakhles, Dhafer; Mabrok, Mohamed			Optimal event-triggered control for wireless power transfer system in electric vehicles	ENERGY SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												This study focuses on stabilizing a bidirectional inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) system using an event-triggered approach. It is only assumed the inductor currents on both the primary and pickup sides are measurable, and they are sent synchronously to the controller via a digital channel. To estimate the unmeasured states and maintain plant stability, a full-order state observer and an observer-based controller have been developed. The control parameters are optimized through a genetic algorithm to achieve the desired output response. An emulation methodology is then applied to create an output-based event-triggering condition. This condition ensures the stability of the closed-loop system even in the presence of communication constraints. To prevent Zeno sampling, a minimal time interval between two transmissions is enforced using time-regularization techniques. Furthermore, the performance of the event-triggered controller is enhanced by solving a linear matrix inequality condition, which further reduces the number of transmission instances. The methodology offers a systematic and optimal design for the bidirectional inductive WPT system. It eliminates the need for manual tuning of control parameters, which is particularly beneficial given the system's complex nature. To address both continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics, the entire system is represented as a hybrid dynamical system, making it more intuitive for networked control systems. The efficiency of this approach is assessed through numerical simulations of a WPT system, demonstrating its effectiveness. The results show that the average intertransmission interval has been increased from 0.0799 to 0.1782 s, that is, the proposed event-triggering strategy reduced the number of transmissions to more than 50% compared with conventional periodic sampling.

Hence, it is necessary to employ generative models to generate some new data used for augmenting the distribution fitting ability of the model by the full utilization of sparse regions. Existing generative models are mostly applied in the image and text generation fields, which are more suitable for discrete data where each variable only consists of integers. To enhance the applicability of generative models in industrial data modeling, a novel vector-quantized weighted-Wasserstein variational autoencoder based soft sensor is developed in this article to solve uneven distribution data. The proposed model further enhances the advantages of present generative models in generating qualified data by redesigning the model structure for clustering and training the data, thereby greatly alleviating poor generative performance caused by sparse regions. Specifically, first, the vector quantization strategy is designed to address the problem of sparse regions. After that, the sparse regions are transferred into the boundary of each group to generate more well-proportioned points. Then, the weighted and continuous variation distance mixture strategy is introduced to better evaluate the divergence between the real and learned distribution without mutation in the training part. Finally, a soft sensor model with the above data augmentation strategies is developed. By comparing it with three state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on a real polyester polymerization dataset, the superiority of the proposed soft sensor model with the novel data augmentation strategies is unequivocally verified.																			1551-3203	1941-0050				2024 JUN 4	2024										10.1109/TII.2024.3403267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TII.2024.3403267		JUN 2024											WOS:001242980500001
J	Jana, D; Chakraborty, N				Jana, Debashis; Chakraborty, Niladri			Generalized stochastic Petri nets for uncertain renewable-based hybrid generation and load in a microgrid system	INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS												Multiple strategy-based microgrid systems, consisting of several renewable energy sources (RES) with distributed storages are becoming well accepted in the context of smart grid framework. While such kind of microgrid seems to be pivotal in future energy structure, they impose numerous setbacks in the power network due to stochastic variability of distributed generations and uncertainties in load. In this paper, it has been emphasized on major challenges of microgrid for secure, automated, and competent operation. To deal with such kind of encounters, the smart modeling of microgrid assets refer to propose an efficient stochastic scaffold of using Petri nets (PNs). PNs are comprehensively used to demonstrate and investigate industrial systems activities under both discrete and continuous-time occurrence. Hence, time-based PNs develop more reliable option for grid penetration strategies in the realm of uncertain function for loads and RES-integrated microgrid. This work intends to uphold such microgrid model that features unpredictability in distributed energy resources and load. The proposed model using PNs produces effective results that are described as in the category of parallel computing. With the awareness of economic green energy platform, a two-stage microgrid model has been designed using generalized stochastic PNs (GSPN). In the first phase, scenario generations have been configured for each uncertain variable, and then modified real-coded genetic algorithm (MRCGA) is utilized to resolve each deterministic dilemma populated from first phase. In order to replicate deliverable attributes of microgrid, reachability graph is stimulated also by useful marking to examine the complete system.

J	Tian, X; Zhu, Q; Li, YN; Wu, M				Tian, Xin; Zhu, Qiang; Li, Yuenan; Wu, Min			Cross-Domain Joint Dictionary Learning for ECG Inference From PPG	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL												The inverse problem of inferring clinical gold-standard electrocardiogram (ECG) from photoplethysmogram (PPG) that can be measured by affordable wearable Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) devices is a research direction receiving growing attention. It combines the easy measurability of PPG and the rich clinical knowledge of ECG for long-term continuous cardiac monitoring. The prior art for reconstruction using a universal basis, such as discrete cosine transform (DCT), has limited fidelity for uncommon ECG shapes due to the lack of representative power. To better utilize the data and improve data representation, we design two dictionary learning frameworks, the cross-domain joint dictionary learning (XDJDL), and the label-consistent XDJDL (LC-XDJDL), to further improve the ECG inference quality and enrich the PPG-based diagnosis knowledge. Building on the K-SVD technique, the proposed joint dictionary learning frameworks extend the expressive power by optimizing simultaneously a pair of signal dictionaries for PPG and ECG with the transforms to relate their sparse codes and disease information. The proposed models are evaluated with a variety of PPG and ECG morphologies from two benchmark datasets that cover various age groups and disease types. The results show the proposed frameworks achieve better inference performance than previous methods with average Pearson coefficients being 0.88 using XDJDL and 0.92 using LC-XDJDL, suggesting an encouraging potential for ECG screening using PPG based on the proactively learned PPG-ECG relationship. By enabling the dynamic monitoring and analysis of the health status of an individual, the proposed frameworks contribute to the emerging digital twins paradigm for personalized healthcare.

Using semi-tensor product of matrices and the matrix expression of logic, the dynamics of a Boolean (control) network can be converted to a discrete time linear (bilinear) dynamics, called the algebraic form of the Boolean (control) network. They provide a framework for this study. Main results consist of two parts: (i) Using logic coordinate transformation, the known sufficient condition based on incidence matrix has been improved. It is also used in stabilizer design. (ii) Based on algebraic form, necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of Boolean networks and stabilization of Boolean control networks respectively are obtained.																			0743-1546		978-1-4244-3872-3				2009							5269	5274		10.1109/CDC.2009.5400138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400138													WOS:000336893605125

Elements within a manufacturing system are connected by a complex network of relations such as material flow, technological dependencies, infrastructure, and intangible cause-and-effect chains. Depending on the scale of changes they may also interfere with engineering, procurement, logistics, or even manufacturing strategy. Thus, the total impact in terms of expected costs and required time for planning and implementation of those "manufacturing changes" is hard to predict. The objective of this paper is to provide a decision support for manufacturing change management and to enable a thorough analysis of changes in manufacturing systems. Although the topic of change propagation received considerable attention in product development in order to quantify the knock-on effects of engineering changes, comparable endeavors have not yet been made in the field of manufacturing science. Following a review of prevailing approaches from product development and manufacturing literature, a model-based approach for the prediction and assessment of change propagation in manufacturing systems is presented. Applied structural modeling techniques, the derived graph algorithm, and the proposed procedure of the approach are outlined. Finally, an industrial case study is presented to demonstrate the potential but also the limitations in practice. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Part 1: Fixed Flow Rate Processes	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												This paper is part 1 of a series dealing with the design of integrated interplant water-allocation and heat-exchange networks (IWAHENs), a special case of interplant network synthesis with multiple physical properties. Traditionally, the tasks of optimizing water-allocation networks (WANs) and heat exchange networks (HENs) were either performed individually or studied within a single plant. In this paper, a novel multiscale state-space superstructure is developed to capture all possible network configurations for the fixed flow rate (FF) IWAHEN designs with both direct and indirect integration schemes. In addition, our model has been simplified to deal with the interplant HEN design where the optimal utility network can be determined simultaneously. By properly addressing the interactions between different plants as well as the WAN and HEN subsystems, lower total annualized cost (TAC) can be obtained in all examples by solving the corresponding mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model.

WaveletKernelNet: An Interpretable Deep Neural Network for Industrial Intelligent Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS												Convolutional neural network (CNN), with the ability of feature learning and nonlinear mapping, has demonstrated its effectiveness in prognostics and health management (PHM). However, an explanation on the physical meaning of a CNN architecture has rarely been studied. In this article, a novel wavelet-driven deep neural network, termed as WaveletKernelNet (WKN), is presented, where a continuous wavelet convolutional (CWConv) layer is designed to replace the first convolutional layer of the standard CNN. This enables the first CWConv layer to discover more meaningful kernels. Furthermore, only the scale parameter and translation parameter are directly learned from raw data at this CWConv layer. This provides a very effective way to obtain a customized kernel bank, specifically tuned for extracting defect-related impact component embedded in the vibration signal. In addition, three experimental studies using data from laboratory environment are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for mechanical fault diagnosis. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the WKNs is higher than CNN by more than 10%, which indicate the importance of the designed CWConv layer. Besides, through theoretical analysis and feature map visualization, it is found that the WKNs are interpretable, have fewer parameters, and have the ability to converge faster within the same training epochs.					zhang, luyu/JJC-4227-2023; LI, Xiang-Yang/JZE-0275-2024; cheng, cheng/JBR-8359-2023; Yan, Ruqiang/A-9776-2012; zhao, zhao/JAC-1686-2023; Zhao, zhuo/JYO-7894-2024; Li, Tianfu/AAV-9975-2020; Gao, Robert/O-9339-2014; Zhao, Zhibin/KIJ-6474-2024	Li, Tianfu/0000-0003-4388-9578; Yan, Ruqiang/0000-0002-1250-4084; Gao, Robert/0000-0003-3595-3728; Zhao, Zhibin/0000-0003-4180-7137													2168-2216	2168-2232				APR	2022	52	4					2302	2312		10.1109/TSMC.2020.3048950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2020.3048950		JAN 2021											WOS:000732143700001

Hassan			A novel approach to hot oil system design for energy conservation	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING												In this paper, a new systematic design methodology was developed for hot oil system by changing arrangement of heat exchanger network from parallel to mixed series/parallel. In re-circulating hot oil systems, hot oil from the hot oil generator is supplied to a network of heaters that usually has a parallel configuration. However, re-use of hot oil between different heating duties enables hot oil networks to be designed with series arrangements. This allows better hot oil generator performance and increased heating capacity, both in the context of new design and retrofit. First, the hot oil generator and the hot oil network were examined separately, in order to discuss the nature of hot oil system design. A model of hot oil systems was then developed to examine the performance of the hot oil generator to recirculation flow rate and return temperature, as well as to predict heating efficiency. In second step, the design of the overall hot oil system was developed by investigating the interactions between the hot oil network design and the hot oil generator performance. Debottlenecking procedures for the design of hot oil systems was also developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The recent additive manufacturing technologies have bridges the gap between the design and manufacture for HEO. The models are the core for additive manufacturing, while designing heterogeneous objects is still a complex task. In this paper, a novel HEO modeling method based on complex networks theory is first proposed. It models the hollowing Voronoi cell as nodes and force relationship among them as edges. The nodes are weighted by the stress distribution in the mode. The force-directed algorithm is applied to construct the initial porous model. A mixed genetic algorithm is then used to accurately adjust the count and distribution of porous structures, which is necessary to reduce consumption and printing costs. The volume minimized HEO model is archived finally.																			1386-7857	1573-7543				MAR	2019	22	2			SI		S2645	S2654		10.1007/s10586-017-1378-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-017-1378-2													WOS:000492605300011

By using operations research, NBN Co expects to avoid more than $AUD1.7 billion in unnecessary construction and design costs on this $AUD36 billion project. At the beginning of this 10-year project, NBN Co divided the country into more than 3,000 fiber-serving-area modules (FSAMs), each covering approximately 2,500 premises, and will design and construct one FSAM each day. NBN Co contracted with Biarri Networks, an Australian commercial mathematics company, to optimize the design task. To accomplish this, Biarri created a fiber-optic network design (FOND) software product based on a network-flow mixed-integer programming engine. This engine minimizes the cost of materials and labor for each FSAM, subject to a variety of constraints, and provides a solution in less than five minutes. To date, more than 650 FSAM designs have been completed using FOND. This has saved NBN Co an estimated $AUD325 million in avoided construction cost, and the planning time per FSAM has decreased from 145 to 16 days.

The focus is on the design of a two-mode-dependent controller that depends on not only the current S-C delay but also the most recent available C-A delay at the controller node. The resulting closed-loop system is transformed to a special discrete-time jump linear system. Then, the sufficient and necessary conditions for the stochastic stability are established. Further, the output feedback controller is designed via the iterative linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Such a process of missing data is described by a discrete-time Markov chain with two modes. Firstly, a necessary and sufficient condition is proposed to check the positivity of the modeled system. Then, necessary and sufficient conditions depending on some probabilities are developed such that the error system is asymptotically mean stable. Based on the given results, sufficient conditions for the existence of the desired positive observer are provided. Moreover, the obtained results are extended to more general cases that the transition probabilities are uncertain and totally unknown. Finally, numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LP-Based Approximation Algorithms for Facility Location in Buy-at-Bulk Network Design	ALGORITHMICA												We study problems that integrate buy-at-bulk network design into the classical (connected) facility location problem. In such problems, we need to open facilities, build a routing network, and route every client demand to an open facility. Furthermore, capacities of the edges can be purchased in discrete units from K different cable types with costs that satisfy economies of scale. We extend the linear programming framework of Talwar (IPCO 2002) for the single-source buy-at-bulk problem to these variants and prove integrality gap upper bounds for both facility location and connected facility location buy-at-bulk problems. For the unconnected variant we prove an integrality gap bound of O(K), and for the connected version, we get the first LP-based bound of O(1).

Global optimization methods, which provide a robust methodology, and metaheuristics in particular have proven to be the most efficient methods for many applications. Despite their utility, there is a limited availability of metaheuristic tools. Results: We present MEIGO, an R and Matlab optimization toolbox (also available in Python via a wrapper of the R version), that implements metaheuristics capable of solving diverse problems arising in systems biology and bioinformatics. The toolbox includes the enhanced scatter search method (eSS) for continuous nonlinear programming (cNLP) and mixed-integer programming (MINLP) problems, and variable neighborhood search (VNS) for Integer Programming (IP) problems. Additionally, the R version includes BayesFit for parameter estimation by Bayesian inference. The eSS and VNS methods can be run on a single-thread or in parallel using a cooperative strategy. The code is supplied under GPLv3 and is available at http://www.iim.csic.es/similar to gingproc/meigo.html. Documentation and examples are included. The R package has been submitted to BioConductor. We evaluate MEIGO against optimization benchmarks, and illustrate its applicability to a series of case studies in bioinformatics and systems biology where it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions: MEIGO provides a free, open-source platform for optimization that can be applied to multiple domains of systems biology and bioinformatics. It includes efficient state of the art metaheuristics, and its open and modular structure allows the addition of further methods.

Its main objective is to allow direct communication between proximity devices without routing data via eNodeB. It can take place either overlay or underlay cellular network. In the first case, dedicated Resource Blocks (RBs) are always allocated for D2D communication, leading to an expected waste of spectral resources. While in the second, D2D pairs share common RBs with the residual cellular users, resulting to highly better network performances, such as spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and coverage extension. But it implies new challenges especially for interference management. For this reason, we will focus in this paper on the design and implementation of an interference aware RB allocation algorithm for D2D communications in order to maximize advantages from its integration in 5G networks without disturbing basic cellular or other D2D communicating pairs. Unlike most of previous game theoretic studies on resource allocation problems considering only pure strategies, firstly we propose a mathematical game theory model for our resource allocation problem as an interpretation of mixed strategy game in normal form and investigate mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) points. This concept allows users to adopt more accurate strategies in order to maximize their utilities according to random network specificities. Furthermore we design a distributed spectral efficient resource allocation algorithm, based on interference minimization schema, leading to performance maximization for the entire networks' communication. Finally, we interpret our MSNE points and final RBs allocation table and compare interference factor and spectral efficiency obtained from our algorithm to other previous solutions through computer simulations.

J	Choi, HS				Choi, Hyun-Sik			Electromyogram (EMG) Signal Classification Based on Light-Weight Neural Network with FPGAs for Wearable Application	ELECTRONICS												Recently, the application of bio-signals in the fields of health management, human-computer interaction (HCI), and user authentication has increased. This is because of the development of artificial intelligence technology, which can analyze bio-signals in numerous fields. In the case of the analysis of bio-signals, the results tend to vary depending on the analyst, owing to a large amount of noise. However, when a neural network is used, feature extraction is possible, enabling a more accurate analysis. However, if the bio-signal time series is analyzed as is, the total neural network increases in size. In this study, to accomplish a light-weight neural network, a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) and a smoothing technique are used for better feature extraction. Moreover, the learning efficiency is increased using an augmentation technique. In designing the neural network, a one-dimensional convolution layer is used to ensure that the neural network is simple and light-weight. Consequently, the light-weight attribute can be achieved, and neural networks can be implemented in edge devices such as the field programmable gate array (FPGA), yielding low power consumption, high security, fast response times, and high user convenience for wearable applications. The electromyogram (EMG) signal represents a typical bio-signal in this study.

As for time delay, neuron state delay is first introduced in this paper. The neuron state delay and the activation function delay are considered simultaneously, which improves system performance effectively. Due to that part of the state is unmeasurable, this paper designs an observer for the observation of state information. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing a method of combining free weighting matrix and integral inequality, an observer-based stability criterion is obtained. The conservativeness of delay upper bound is reduced actively. At last, a controller is designed for the stochastic neural network. Numerical examples are given to prove the effectiveness of the results.

Implementation of scatter search for multi-objective optimization: a comparative study	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS												Interest in the design of efficient meta-heuristics for the application to combinatorial optimization problems is growing rapidly. The optimal design of water distribution networks is an important optimization problem which consists of finding the best way of conveying water from the sources to the users, thus satisfying their requirements. The efficient design of looped networks is a much more complex problem than the design of branched ones, but their greater reliability can compensate for the increase in cost when closing some loops. Mathematically, this is a non-linear optimization problem, constrained to a combinatorial space, since the diameters are discrete and it has a very large number of local solutions. Many works have dealt with the minimization of the cost of the network but few have considered their cost and reliability simultaneously. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the performance of an implementation of Scatter Search in a multi-objective formulation of this problem. Results obtained in three benchmark networks show that the method here proposed performs accurately well in comparison with other multi-objective approaches also implemented.

J	Ferrier, S; Drielsma, M				Ferrier, Simon; Drielsma, Michael			Synthesis of pattern and process in biodiversity conservation assessment: a flexible whole-landscape modelling framework	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim To describe a general modelling framework for integrating multiple pattern- and process-related factors into biodiversity conservation assessments across whole landscapes. Location New South Wales (Australia), and world-wide. Methods The framework allows for a rich array of alternatives to the target-based model traditionally underpinning systematic conservation planning and consists of three broad modelling components. The first component models the future state (condition) of habitat across a landscape as a function of present state, current and projected pressures acting on this state, and any proposed, or implemented, management interventions. The second component uses this spatially explicit prediction of future habitat state to model the level of persistence expected for each of a set of surrogate biodiversity entities. The third component then integrates these individual expectations to estimate the overall level of persistence expected for biodiversity as a whole. Results Options are explored for tailoring implementation of the framework to suit planning processes varying markedly in purpose, and in availability of data, time, funding and expertise. The framework allows considerable flexibility in the nature of employed biodiversity surrogates (species-level, discrete or continuous community-level) and spatial data structures (polygonal planning units, or fine-scaled raster), the level of sophistication with which each of the three modelling components is implemented (from simple target-based assessment to complex process-based modelling approaches), and the forms of higher-level analysis supported (e.g. optimal plan development, priority mapping, interactive scenario evaluation). Main conclusions The described framework provides a logical, and highly flexible, foundation for integrating disparate pattern- and process-related factors into conservation assessments in dynamic, multiple-use landscapes.

The gain variation of the additive type is introduced to depict the possible implementation imprecision in the neuron state estimator. A non-fragile state estimator is constructed which can guarantee the estimation performance against the gain variations. On the basis of the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are put forward to ensure that the desired non-fragile state estimators can exist. The explicit expression of the desired estimators is obtained in terms of the solution to a linear matrix inequality.

Nonetheless, there are many subtle nuances in instructors' design decisions that might not easily be captured using LA tools. Therefore, this study sets out to explore how and why instructors design for learning in an online and distance higher education setting by employing a mixed-method approach, which combined semi-structured interviews of 12 instructors with network analyses of their LDs. Our findings uncovered several underlying factors that influenced how instructors designed their modules and highlighted some discrepancies between instructors' pedagogical beliefs and their actual LD as captured by the Open University Learning Design Initiative (OULDI).

By constructing a suitable fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with membership functions, the sufficient condition of the stability criteria has been established for the discrete-time T-S fuzzy systems with additive time-varying delays. To do this, the extended version of Wirtinger's inequality is used to bound the forward differences of the LKF. By utilizing the T-S fuzzy model approach, the dynamics of each fuzzy rule is expressioned by a linear system.

Here, we introduce a convenient microfluidics-guided dipeptide design as a platform for photodegradation of contaminants in water. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) are chosen as photocatalysts due to their vastly studied properties. By using a well-defined microchannel architecture, the dipeptide N-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) and TiO2 NPs are efficiently mixed leading to a self-assembled Fmoc-FF hydrogel with embedded TiO2. Owing to shear-thinning and rapid self-healing of Fmoc-FF hydrogels, we can transfer and inject Fmoc-FF/TiO2 hydrogels into any other microdevice for specific applications, where these low-molecular-weight-gelator-(LMWG-)based Fmoc-FF hydrogels fill out the micro-channel volume. Different morphologies of Fmoc-FF/TiO2 hydrogels are obtained by simple concentration screening of TiO2 NPs and Fmoc-FF. Owing to the density of the three-dimensionally twined Fmoc-FF nanofibers,solutions swelling the dipeptide hydrogel can be exchanged without leaching out TiO2 NPs. By further analysis, our hydrogel-filled flow cell can be employed for continuous-flow photodegradation in water under light irradiation. Especially, compared to the TiO2 NPs suspension, Fmoc-FF/TiO2 hydrogels with relatively low concentrations of TiO2 exhibit enhanced photodegradation capabilities due to better dispersion of nanoparticles. Such strategy provides a versatile platform for embedment of small inorganic catalysts or enzymes for (bio-) chemical conversion of solutes passing through the hydrogel network.

The distinguishing features are: the inventory management, the presence of multiple plants, and the single source constraints in both echelons. A key issue is that demand at each distribution center is a function of the demands at the retailers assigned, which is a random variable whose value is not known at the time of designing the network. We focus on the mathematical modeling of the problem and the evaluation of the performance of the developed models, so, it can be observed the troubles that arise when modeling supply chains that consider different types of decisions.

Firstly, the dynamic model description studied is given, which, if the packet dropout is assumed to be a discrete-time homogenous Markov process, the class of discrete-time linear systems with packet loss can be regarded as Markovian jump systems. Based on Lyapunov function approach, sufficient conditions are established for the resulting closed-loop discrete-time system with Markovian jumps to be stochastic H-infinity finite-time boundedness and then state feedback controllers are designed to guarantee stochastic H-infinity finite-time stabilization of the class of stochastic systems. The stochastic H-infinity finite-time boundedness criteria can be tackled in the form of linear matrix inequalities with a fixed parameter. As an auxiliary result, we also give sufficient conditions on the robust stochastic stabilization of the class of linear systems with packet loss. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the developed scheme.

Effects of resilience-oriented design on distribution networks operation planning	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH												This paper presents an optimal framework for the resilience-oriented design (ROD) in distribution networks to protect these grids against extreme weather events such as earthquakes and floods. This strategy minimizes the summation of daily investment and repair costs of back up distributed generation (DG), hardening and tie lines, operation cost of network and DGs, and load shedding cost. Also, it considers AC power flow equations, system operation limits and planning and reconfiguration constraints. This problem is generally a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, but it is converted to a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem to achieve a globally optimal solution with a low computation time. Moreover, the Benders decomposition (BD) approach is used for the proposed problem to obtain higher computation speed in large scale networks. In addition, this problem includes uncertain parameters such as load, energy price, and availability of network equipment in the case of extreme weather conditions. Hence, a scenario-based stochastic programming (SBSP) approach is used to model these uncertain parameters in the proposed ROD method, based on a hybrid approach, including roulette wheel mechanism (RWM) and the simultaneous backward method. The proposed problem is simulated on 33-bus and large-scale 119-bus distribution networks to prove its capabilities in different case studies.

J	Zang, YS; Wang, MQ; Liu, HQ; Qi, MY				Zang, Yongsen; Wang, Meiqin; Liu, Huiqiang; Qi, Mingyao			Moment-based distributionally robust joint chance constrained optimization for service network design under demand uncertainty	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING												This paper proposes a distributionally robust joint chance constrained (DRJCC) programming approach to optimize the service network design (SND) problem under demand uncertainty. The distributionally robust method does not need complete distribution information and utilizes restricted historical data knowledge, which is significant in scarce data situations. The joint consideration of chance constraints enables more effective control of event probability, by which network managers can realize the purpose of controlling the overall service level of multi-commodities in a service network. DRJCC optimization can also help decision-makers adjust the network's conservativeness, robustness, and service rates by setting the probability parameters of the chance constraints. We reformulate the DRJCC model by addressing the corresponding distributionally robust joint chance constraints with the worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk method and Lagrange duality theory. The model is approximately reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which is easier to solve than the mixed-integer semi-definite programming model in existing literature. We also develop two benchmark approaches for comparison: Bonferroni inequality approximation and scenario-based stochastic program. Comparative numerical studies demonstrate the robustness and the validation of the proposed formulations. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the industrial performance of the uncertain SND under the DRJCC formulation. We explore the impact of the confidence level parameter on operational cost and real service level, reveal the general correlation between them. We also extract several risk-averse managerial insights for logistics fleet managers.																			1389-4420	1573-2924				2023 NOV 21	2023										10.1007/s11081-023-09858-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11081-023-09858-0		NOV 2023											WOS:001105474400001

This paper presents a methodology framework to formulate and solve the bus transit network design problem (TNDP). It first proposes a TNDP taking into account the travel time stochasticity. A robust optimization model is formulated for the proposed problem, which aims to minimize the sum of the expected value of the operator cost and its variability multiplied by a weighting value. A heuristic solution approach, based on k-shortest path algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, Monte Carlo simulation, and probit-type discrete choice model, is subsequently developed to solve the robust optimization model.

By employing neural networks (NNs) to approximate the unknown dynamic of the manipulators, a neural state observer is first designed to estimate the immeasurable joint velocity of the robotic manipulators. A novel NN weight updating law is designed such that the estimation errors are ultimately uniformly bounded. Based on the designed state observer, an output feedback ETC scheme is developed for rigid robotic manipulators with n-degree of freedom. Simulation study demonstrates that the proposed ETC scheme not only guarantees the ultimately uniformly boundedness of the robotic manipulator control system, but also alleviates the transmission burden of the controller-to-actuator communication network.																					978-1-6654-1882-9				2020							41	46		10.1109/ISAS49493.2020.9378865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISAS49493.2020.9378865													WOS:000670881500008

Irregularities such as bus bunching lead to loss of time and decrease bus service quality. Development of bus transport system management schemes to avoid bus bunching and improve performance are of high importance, and has thus been the focus of many works in the public transport systems literature. Motivated by the importance of developing bus control strategies for improving performance, and specifically by the lack of a detailed but computationally efficient mathematical model describing bus transport system dynamics in the literature (which can facilitate model-based control design), we propose a mixed logical dynamical model of a single loop bus transport system, which involves both continuous (e.g., bus positions) and binary (e.g., the state of a bus regarding whether it is holding at a certain stop or not) states. Furthermore, we develop a hybrid model predictive control scheme with actuation via bus speeds, which can regularize headways and improve bus service quality. Performance of the predictive controller is evaluated via simulation experiments using the proposed model, where the passenger demands and maximum bus speeds are extracted from data collected from the bus network of the city of Fribourg. Results indicate the potential of the proposed controller in avoiding bus bunching and decreasing passenger travel times.

The buffer dynamics at the switch is modeled as a nonlinear discrete-time system and a NN-based predictive controller is designed to predict the explicit values of the transmission rates of the sources so as to prevent congestion. Tuning methods are provided for the NN weights to estimate the unpredictable and statistically fluctuating network traffic. Mathematical analysis is given to demonstrate the stability of the closed-loop system so that a desired quality of service (QoS) can be guaranteed. The QoS is defined in terms of cell loss ratio (CLR) and latency. We derive design rules mathematically for selecting the NN tuning algorithm such that the desired performance is guaranteed during congestion and potential tradeoffs are shown. Simulation results are provided to justify the theoretical conclusions for single source/single switch scenario using ON/OFF data. Finally, comparison studies are also included to show the effectiveness of the proposed method over conventional rate-based and thresholding techniques during simulated congestion.

In this article, we present SNNAuth, a novel sensor-based continuous Authentication system on smartphones that utilizes Spiking Neural Networks, leveraging biometric behavioral patterns captured by smartphone sensors. To enhance discriminative feature extraction, we introduce positional encoding into the time slicing of normalized sensor data. We design the artificial neural network (ANN)-SNN model, which transforms the trained ANN into an SNN by converting weights and activations into suitable spike neuron models and synaptic connections. The ANN-SNN model, designed for efficient computation and increased robustness, is specifically trained to extract temporal features of a legitimate user. With the extracted features of a legitimate user, we then train the one-class k-nearest neighbors (OC-kNN), which is employed for conducting the classification for all users. Based on the trained ANN-SNN and one-class kNN, SNNAuth determines whether the current user is legitimate or an imposter. Finally, we evaluate the performance of SNNAuth on two public data sets and our data set, and the experimental results demonstrate that SNNAuth outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by achieving the highest accuracy and the lowest equal error rates (EERs) on all three data sets.

We added a wide-bandgap PCDTBT polymer as a third component into PTB7-Th: PC71BM binary blend, which improves photoconversion efficiency (PCE) with efficient energy transfer, enhanced light absorption, and better morphology of the ternary blends. The enhanced PCE is attributed to the absorption improvement and non-radiative Fo & BULL;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between PTB7-Th/PCDTBT polymers and the formation of a more fine bi-continuous interpenetrating network with a large donor/acceptor interfacial area with improved phase separation in the ternary system. Simultaneously, the addition of PCDTBT into PTB7-Th: PC71BM binary blend promotes the energetic disorder at the donor/acceptor interface in t-OSCs. This energetic disorder is studied in terms of Urbach energy and electroluminescence quantum efficiency. It was observed that the addition of PCDTBT into PTB7-Th: PC71BM affects the Urbach energy of PTB7-Th: PC71BM, which changes in bulk from 42 to 40.50 meV, and 42.70-50 meV for donor/acceptor interface. Interestingly, the energetic disorder at the donor/acceptor interface increases while the disorder in bulk decreases after the addition of PCDTBT polymer. Our results indicate that incorporating a wide-bandgap polymer as a third component is an appropriate way to design high-performance devices.

Therefore, optimization of the tree-tree pipeline network becomes urgent and indispensable. In this paper, a comprehensive optimization objective function and constraints is established to allow layout design. In view of the characteristics of the model comprising numerous discrete variables (e.g. location, number, allocation relationship, connection decision variable etc), a hierarchical optimization strategy is proposed to decompose it into three sub-problems. On the basis of the proposed model, an optimization program based on Delaunay triangulation has been presented to solve the non-linear constrained optimization problem which contains connection decision variable between wells in clusters on the constraint condition of path length restriction. Further, the reason of using Delaunay triangulation is analyzed and the optimization process of the essential sub-problem has been illustrated. Moreover, the developed program has been applied to a practical coalbed methane field project. The model and method in this paper is shown to be feasible and effective to solve layout optimization on two-level tree-tree pipeline network.

In this paper, given the logical topology of the network, we formulate the joint channel allocation, interface assignment, and media access control (MAC) problem as a cross-layer non-linear mixed-integer network utility maximization problem. An optimal joint design, based on exact binary linearization techniques, is proposed which leads to a global maximum. A near-optimal joint design, based on approximate dual decomposition techniques, is also proposed which is of more interest in terms of practical deployment. Performance evaluation is given through a number of numerical examples in terms of network utility maximization and aggregate network throughput.

J	Liu, LZ; Wang, YH; Gao, ZL				Liu, Lizhi; Wang, Yinhe; Gao, Zilin			Tracking control for the dynamic links of discrete-time complex dynamical network via state observer	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION												In this paper, a class of discrete-time complex dynamical networks with time-varying links is regarded to be composed of the nodes subsystem and links subsystem which are mutually coupled. In the existing literatures on complex dynamical networks, the emphasizes is synchronization or stabilization of nodes, the dynamic behaviors of the links between nodes are always ignored. It is noted that the state of links is very important to the networks in practical, such as, the tension value of webs in web-winding system, the relationships between individuals in social network, therefore, discussing the tracking control problem for links subsystem is also of practical significance. Considering the state of links is difficult to be measured accurately in practice applications, this makes it difficult to design the controller. In view of this, a state observer is proposed for the links subsystem modeled mathematically by the Riccati matrix difference equation in this paper. And then the control scheme is proposed for the links subsystem by employing the state observer such that the links subsystem asymptotically converging to the given target. Finally, the simulations are used to show the validity of the method in this paper. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this work, the MCAPN with positive coupling coefficient is adopted to design an analog phase shifter. The phase shifter is realized using a GaAs-based integrated passive device (IPD) process in conjunction with surface-mount discrete GaAs hyperabrupt varactor diodes. Measurement results show that, with the bias voltage swept from 2 to 18 V, the insertion loss is less than 4.3 dB and the maximum phase shift is 185.5 degree at 7.3 GHz.																					978-1-6654-9418-2				2023							632	634		10.1109/APMC57107.2023.10439670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/APMC57107.2023.10439670													WOS:001174207300212

The analysis of the evolution of water age as a simple indicator of water quality in the network is of great interest in both the design and operation phases. Understanding the factors that have the strongest influence on water quality is key to developing adequate strategies aimed at preserving it. This paper first analyses the factors with the biggest influence on the tank's water age to support the selection of the most appropriate configuration from the point of view of water quality during design phases. Then, the main considerations when modelling tanks following the different mixing models considered in Epanet are presented. Also, real tank behaviour is characterised through field measurements and Epanet simulations in order to determine the best-fitting mixing model.																				2073-4441				MAY	2024	16	9							1265	10.3390/w16091265	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16091265													WOS:001220109900001

The Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is employed to characterize the hysteresis loop in piezoelectric actuator. The main contributions are as follows: 1) by using the dynamic surface control technique, which introduces the digital first-order low-pass filter, the original control system are not required to be transformed into an unknown special form; 2) the hysteresis implicit inverse compensator is constructed to overcome the hysteresis, which implies that the hysteresis item coupled with control signal is treated as the temporary control signal from which the method of searching the approximately control signal is designed; and 3) by employing the experimental platform of the piezoelectric positioning stage, the experimental verifications of the designed discrete-time adaptive controller are implemented. It is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive dynamic surface discrete-time motion control (ADSDMC) scheme.

These critical infrastructures are designed to fulfill some continuous missions, such as traffic flow and electricity. However, due to aging and load-stress, the healthy state of the system will degrade and the reliability will decrease gradually. Different from the other systems which can be shut down for maintenance, the network-based system must provide continuous service meanwhile keep its reliability at a certain criterion. Thus, in this paper, a system is modeled by a network with single-origin and single-destination. The arcs degrade gradually and are modeled by a Gamma distribution with load-stress. The minimum flow of the network should be satisfied all the time. A selective maintenance strategy with sliding maintenance window is proposed based on the remaining useful life and the maximum change of network flow of each arcs. The aim of this study is to optimize the maintenance sequence of the arcs and meanwhile keep the continuous constraint of the network flow. Some numerical simulations will be conducted.

A practical scenario with multiple switching communication channels coexisting in the network is considered. System signals are exchanged over the multiple communication channels and each channel is subject to the two main transmission imperfections, network-induced time-varying delays and packet dropouts. The channel switching is assumed to be governed by a continuous-time Markov process, and a Markov jump non-linear system model is exploited to represent the overall networked system. Linear estimators are designed such that the underlying estimation error system is stochastically stable and the disturbance rejection attenuation satisfies an H-infinity performance bound. As a case study, a state estimation problem for an intelligent active suspension system is addressed to verify the theoretical findings.

We apply our strategy on solving two typical topologies structures: the Mesh and the Self-Healing Rings. The typical strategies for solving the logical topology design for both structures are those based on the use of mixed-integer linear programming. However the literature shows that these approaches can be frustrating, time consuming and costly. As an alternative to these strategies, our approach combines the capability of meta heuristics of finding good solutions in a very short computational time and provides the mixed-integer linear programming with good upperbounds in order to pruning great chunk of the searching space. In this work we show that our approach is promising as we are able to solve large problems in a reasonable amount of time for both type of topologies we studied.					Segatto, M. E.

This result prompts the question of what is the added value of modeling learning through neural networks. We submit that this modeling approach allows for models that are able to distinguish among and respond differently to different payoff structures. Moreover, the process of categorization of a game is implicitly carried out by these models, thus without the need of any external explicit theory of similarity between games. To validate our claims, we designed and ran two multigame experiments in which subjects faced, in random sequence, different instances of two completely mixed 2 x 2 games. Then, we tested on our experimental data two regret-driven neural network models, and compared their performance with that of other established models of learning and Nash equilibrium.						warglien, massimo/0000-0002-0615-4938; Marchiori, Davide/0000-0001-7914-5568													1662-453X						2011	5								139	10.3389/fnins.2011.00139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2011.00139								22207832					WOS:000209200600134

Artificial neural networks represent a computational methodology widely used to uncover the structure of a large val icr) of data. in general, one may recommend the application of neural networks in areas characterized by noise, poorly under stood intrinsic structure, and changing characteristics.

J	Lin, JS; Liu, SH				Lin, JS; Liu, SH			A competitive continuous Hopfield neural network for vector quantization in image compression	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE												Vector quantization is a system in which a distortion function is minimized for multidimensional optimization problems. The purpose of such a system is data compression. In this paper, a parallel approach using the competitive continuous Hopfield neural network (CCHNN) is proposed for the vector quantization in image compression. In CCHNN, the codebook design is conceptually considered as a clustering problem. Here, it is a kind of continuous Hopfield network model imposed by the winner-take-all mechanism, working toward minimizing an objective function that is defined as the average distortion measure between any two training vectors within the same class (within-class). It also forward maximizes an objective function defined as the average distortion measure between any two training vectors in separate classes (between-dass). For an image of n training vectors and c objects of interest, the proposed CCHNN would consist of nx c neurons. Each neuron (or training vector) occupies Ix I components of a training vector. In the experimental results, the proposed method shows more promising results after convergence than the generalized Lloyd algorithm. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

First, different from the existing results, considering the noncausal problem which may exist in the backstepping design procedure, a universal system transformation method is first proposed for a class of nonstrict-feedback discrete-time systems. Second, by defining a compensation term to compensate the controller and utilizing the property of radial-basis-function neural network (RBFNN), an RL-based direct adaptive control strategy is developed via a backstepping method to achieve optimal control, and the multigradient recursive (MGR) algorithm is employed to estimate the weight vector. Finally, the stability of the control system is guaranteed and all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) on the basis of the Lyapunov theory. In addition, a universal system transformation is first proposed which breaks through the limitations on the controller design for the discrete-time nonstrict-feedback nonlinear system by using the traditional method. The validity of this strategy is verified by two simulation examples that include a course keeping system of the marine vessel.

Otherwise it is formally analogous to the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).(1) Simulated Annealing is a stochastic optimization method that is suitable for performing nonlinear multivariable optimization tasks. Training a Boolean Neural Network is a well-suited problem to this algorithm. However, the Simulated Annealing method is computationally heavy, which makes the training procedure slow. The training speed can be improved by using custom designed hardware for the whole system including the optimization method and the neural network. Hardware prototypes of a Boolean Neural Network and the Simulated Annealing optimization method have been designed(a) using discrete components. The Boolean Neural Network implementation is basically a dynamically configurable feedforward network of Boolean logic gates of two inputs.

By properly adjusting the phase characteristics of the output matching network (OMN) of the carrier amplifier (CA) and the harmonic impedances of the postmatching network (PMN), the load impedance of CA can be effectively tuned to meet the impedance requirements of continuous class-J and continuous class-F-1 modes at the power back-off point, which thus extends the bandwidth with enhanced power back-off efficiency. In addition, the proposed DPA can theoretically achieve saturation efficiency of more than 58.7% over the working frequency. Based on the proposed method, a broadband continuous class-J/F(-1 )mode asymmetrical DPA operating from 1.3 to 2.5 GHz (63%) is designed and measured. Under the continuous wave stimulation, the measured 9-dB back-off, 6-dB back-off, and saturation efficiencies are 55%-62.5%, 52.4%-65.6%, and 62.5%-81%, respectively. The measured 9-dB back-off and saturation gains are 8.8-11.3 and 7-10.6 dB, respectively.

The data dropout is essentially unavoidable, especially in wireless networks and it results from transmission errors and network traffic congestion. Multiple time-varying network traffic status given by discrete-time homogeneous Markov chains is assumed. The authors estimate the network traffic status characterised by the probability matrix of the Markov chain online from the data dropout history. According to the estimation of network traffic status, an appropriate controller is selected to improve the control performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations and experiments.

Development of Cryogenic Extrusion Techniques and Modelling of a Twin Screw Extruder: A Review	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY												A fusion reactor must be fueled by solid pellet injection at the high field side to ensure uniform fuelling and meet the fuel cycle requirements. A reliable extrusion system must be developed to solidify and extrude the fuel in the form of a fine filament. Over the past few decades, various extrusion systems such as in-situ, piston-cylinder, single screw, twin screw extrusion were developed to progress into achieving the extrusion rate specified by ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor). Among these techniques, twin screw extruder promises to be reliable due to its continuous operation and stable throughput. This review article has twin objectives. First, it seeks to provide an overview of developments carried out so far for the cryogenic extruders like conceptualization, prototype development and performance. The numerical modelling of cryogenic extruders is at infant stage. Therefore, the second objective of this paper is to review various numerical models from polymer extrusion research and explain the need to adopt those models to arrive at the more optimal design of an extruder. In addition, the thermo-physical properties of hydrogenic fuels are reviewed, which is very important for developing numerical models. Also, this paper brings out the critical gaps that exist in the CFD modelling of a twin screw extruder. The present review work would be of great importance to the scientific community working toward plasma fueling.						, Senthil Kumar.

First, we propose an ordering/expediting policy and derive expressions for evaluating the operating characteristics of such systems. Second, using extensive numerical experiments, we quantify the benefits of such an expediting policy. Third, we investigate a number of managerial issues. Specifically, we analyze the impact of the number of expediting hubs and their locations along the shipment network on the performance of such systems and offer insights into the design of the shipment network. We show (i) a single expediting hub that is optimally located in a shipment network can capture the majority of cost savings achieved by a multi-hub system, especially when expediting cost is not low or demand variability is not high; (ii) when expediting time is proportional to the time to destination, for small-enough or large-enough demand variations, a single expediting hub located in the middle of the shipment network can capture the majority of cost savings of an optimally located hub; and (iii) in general, hubs close to the retailer significantly drive down costs, whereas hubs close to the supplier may not offer much cost savings.																			1059-1478	1937-5956				JAN	2014	23	1					95	109		10.1111/poms.12031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/poms.12031													WOS:000331069100007

Only one of the multiple levels of the facility can be built on each node, and each level facility has output capability limit and cost attribute. We proposed a LP-relaxation guided variable selection method which can reduce the search space effectively by removing many of the binary variables. The algorithm gains information from the temporary search node in branch and bound procedure so that it will retain the cost-effective variables to guarantee the quality of the solution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is testified via experimental comparison with the original model on randomly generated data. Comparison results show that our method can generate solution within 0.5% of original model thus saving considerable time.					qian, kun/C-6919-2012																978-1-5386-4362-4				2018							443	448																WOS:000455001500078

This model is also called atomic (weighted) network congestion game. The problem can be presented as follows : given a network, which edges should be removed to minimize the cost of the worst Nash equilibrium? We consider both computational issues and existential issues (i.e. the power of network design). We give inapproximability results and approximation algorithms for this network design problem. For networks with linear edge latency functions we prove that there is no approximation algorithm for this problem with approximation ratio less then (3 + root 5)/2 approximate to 2.618 unless P = NP. We also show that for networks with polynomials of degree d edge latency functions there is no approximation algorithm for this problem with approximation ratio less then do(d) unless P = NP. Moreover, we observe that the trivial algorithm that builds the entire network is optimal for linear edge latency functions and has an approximation ratio of d(circle minus(d)) for polynomials of degree d edge latency functions. Finally, we consider general continuous, non-decreasing edge latency functions and show that the approximation ratio of any approximation algorithm for this problem is unbounded, assuming P not equal NP. In terms of existential issues we show that network design cannot improve the maximum possible bound on the price of anarchy in the worst case. Previous results of Roughgarden for networks with n vertices where each user controls only a negligible fraction of the overall traffic showed optimal inapproximability results of 4/3 for linear edge latency functions, circle minus(d/In d) for polynomial edge latency functions and n/2 for general continuous non-decreasing edge latency functions. He also showed that the trivial algorithm that builds the entire network is optimal for that case.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	3-540-32207-8				2006	3879						41	54																WOS:000236483500004

This consists of making strategic and tactical decisions: opening, closing or expanding facilities, selecting suppliers and defining the product flows. We use a heuristic approach based on the linear relaxation of the original mixed integer linear problem (MILP). The main idea is to solve a sequence of linear relaxations of the original MILP, and to fix as many binary variables as possible at every iteration. This simple process is coupled with several rounding procedures for some key decision variables. The number of binary decision variables in the resulting MILP is small enough for it to be solved with a solver. The main benefit of this approach is that it provides feasible solutions of good quality within an affordable computation time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design/methodology/approach By using the input-output characteristic curve of controlled plant and the set of IF-THEN rules based on human knowledge inspiration, the adaptive controller is established by an adaptive FREN. The learning algorithm is established with convergence proof of the closed-loop system and controller's parameters are directly designed by experimental data. Findings The convergence of tracking error is verified by the theoretical results and the experimental systems. The experimental systems and comparison results show that the proposed controller and its design procedure based on input-output data can achieve superior performance. Practical implications - The theoretical aspect and experimental systems with the light-emitting diode (LED) current control and the robotic system prove that the proposed controller can be designed by using only input-output data of the controlled plants when the tracking error can be affirmed the convergence. Originality/value The proposed controller has been theoretically developed and used through experimental systems by using only input-output data of the controlled plant. The novel design procedure has been proposed by using the input-output characteristic curve for both positive and negative control directions.

Designing Solutions Around Customer Network Identity Goals	JOURNAL OF MARKETING												When companies fail to account for collective and relational goals in customer solutions, a mismatch can occur between firms' solutions and those that customers envision. Understanding the integration processes of customer networks is essential to improving solution design. This investigation draws on depth interviews with 21 families, the focal customer network, to generate collective and relational vacation narratives that contextualize their accounts. The authors identify four customer network integration processes: offerings assembled around prioritized goals, alternate participation, concurrent participation, and offerings assembled around separate coalitions. The findings reveal that the resulting mix of integrated products and services, or the solution, is shaped by customer network identity goals, goal management approaches, and constraints. The authors conclude with recommendations for how firms can use this information to improve solution design, identify new network partners, and revise value propositions.																			0022-2429	1547-7185				MAR	2011	75	2					36	54		10.1509/jmkg.75.2.36	http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.75.2.36													WOS:000287985200003

We consider different factors that lead to misrepresented performance, are incompatible with stated system and threat models or impede reproducibility and comparability with previous work. Specifically, we investigate the effects of (i) small sample sizes ( both number of users and recording sessions), (ii) using different phone models in training data, (iii) selecting non-contiguous training data, (iv) inserting attacker samples in training data and (v) swipe aggregation. We perform a systematic review of 30 touch dynamics papers showing that all of them overlook at least one of these pitfalls. To quantify each pitfall's effect, we design a set of experiments and collect a new longitudinal dataset of touch dynamics from 470 users over 31 days comprised of 1,166,092 unique swipes. We make this dataset and our code available online. Our results show significant percentage-point changes in reported mean EER for several pitfalls: including attacker data (2.55%), non-contiguous training data (3.8%), phone model mixing (3.2%-5.8%). We show that, in a common evaluation setting, cumulative effects of these evaluation choices result in a combined difference of 8.9% EER. We also largely observe these effects across the entire ROC curve. Furthermore, we validate the pitfalls on four distinct classifiers - SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network, and kNN. Based on these insights, we propose a set of best practices that, if followed, will lead to more realistic and comparable reporting of results in the field.																					978-1-4503-9140-5				2022							1049	1063		10.1145/3488932.3517388	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3488932.3517388													WOS:000937026200077

The H-infinity, performance analysis of networked systems is generalized from the entire-frequency region to some finite-frequency regions. A necessary and sufficient condition in the centralized manner is established to check the finite-frequency bounded realness property of networked systems. Moreover, in order to design a distributed filter and reduce the computational effort, a sufficient condition in terms of individual subsystems is developed. Based on the new condition derived, a sufficient condition is given for the existence of the distributed filter and an LMI method is then presented for designing the distributed filter. A practical example is included to illustrate the proposed approach in this paper and it is shown that the developed finite-frequency bounded realness condition is less conservative than the existing entire-frequency one.

J	Shahabi, C; Banaei-Kashani, F				Shahabi, C; Banaei-Kashani, F			Decentralized resource management for a distributed continuous media server (vol 13, pg 710, 2002)	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS												Distributed continuous media server (DCMS) architectures are proposed to minimize the communication-storage cost for those continuous media applications that serve a large number of geographically distributed clients. Typically, a DCMS is designed as a pure hierarchy (tree) of centralized continuous media servers. In an earlier work, we proposed a redundant hierarchical topology for DCMS networks, termed RedHi, which can potentially result in higher utilization and better reliability over pure hierarchy. In this paper, we focus on the design of a resource management system for RedHi that can exploit the resources of its DCMS network to achieve these performance objectives. Our proposed resource management system is based on a fully decentralized approach to achieve optimal scalability and robustness. In general, the major drawback of a fully decentralized design is the increase in latency time and communication overhead to locate the requested object. However, as compared to the typically long duration and high resource/bandwidth requirements of continuous media objects, the extra latency and overhead of a decentralized resource management approach become negligible. Moreover, our resource management system collapses three management tasks, 1) object location, 2) path selection, and 3) resource reservation, into one fully decentralized object delivery mechanism, reducing the latency even further. In sum, decentralization of the resource management satisfies our scalability and robustness objectives, whereas collapsing the management tasks helps alleviate the latency and overhead constraints. To achieve a high resource utilization, the object delivery scheme uses our proposed cost function, as well as various object location and resource reservation policies to select and allocate the best streaming path to serve each request. The object delivery scheme is designed as an application layer resource management middleware for the DCMS architecture to be independent of the underlying telecommunication infrastructure. Our experiments show that our resource management system is successful in realization of the higher resource utilization for the DCMS networks with the RedHi topology.

Here, we propose a realistic model for the implementation of neural networks on photonic quantum computers. Specially, we design a quantum circuit built in the continuous-variable (CV) architecture that encodes information in the spectral amplitude functions of single-photons. This circuit consisting of some electro-optical modulators and XOR boxes that, respectively, adjust and combine their entries to provide a weighted sum of input signals. We show that our model can reproduce classical neural network models while maintaining some quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. In particular, we utilize the circuit as a quantum classifier and validate the CV quantum neural network architecture through doing some machine learning modeling experiments. Such a quantum circuit can be implemented on the CV photonic quantum computers that promise exponential speed-up over the classical computers for specific tasks.

Yet, most generative and parametric approaches focus on physical characteristics, such as a neighborhoods walkability, energy efficiency, and urban form. Here, we study the colocation patterns of more than one million amenities in 47 U.S. cities to model the amenity mix of neighborhoods, and to identify the amenities that are overor under-supplied in a neighborhood. We build this model by combining a clustering algorithm, designed to identify amenity-dense neighborhoods, and a network, connecting amenities that are likely to collocate.

J	Shahabi, C; Banaei-Kashani, F				Shahabi, C; Banaei-Kashani, F			Decentralized resource management for a distributed continuous media server	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS												Distributed continuous media server (DCMS) architectures are proposed to minimize the communication-storage cost for those continuous media applications that serve a large number of geographically distributed clients. Typically, a DCMS is designed as a pure hierarchy (tree) of centralized continuous media servers. In an earlier work, we proposed a redundant hierarchical topology for DCMS networks, termed RedHi, which can potentially result in higher utilization and better reliability over pure hierarchy. In this paper, we focus on the design of a resource management system for RedHi that can exploit the resources of its DCMS network to achieve these performance objectives. Our proposed resource management system is based on a fully decentralized approach to achieve optimal scalability and robustness. In general, the major drawback of a fully decentralized design is the increase in latency time and communication overhead to locate the requested object. However, as compared to the typically long duration and high resource/bandwidth requirements of continuous media objects, the extra latency and overhead of a decentralized resource management approach become negligible. Moreover, our resource management system collapses three management tasks, 1) object location, 2) path selection, and 3) resource reservation, into one fully decentralized object delivery mechanism, reducing the latency even further. In sum, decentralization of the resource management satisfies our scalability and robustness objectives, whereas collapsing the management tasks helps alleviate the latency and overhead constraints. To achieve a high resource utilization, the object delivery scheme uses our proposed cost function, as well as various object location and resource reservation policies to select and allocate the best streaming path to serve each request. The object delivery scheme is designed as an application layer resource management middleware for the DCMS architecture to be independent of the underlying telecommunication infrastructure. Our experiments show that our resource management system is successful in realization of the higher resource utilization for the DCMS networks with the RedHi topology.

In contrast to traditional reinforcement learning-based methods for optimal coordination and control of multi-agent systems with a time-triggered control mechanism, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed to update the controller only when the designed events are triggered, which reduces the computational burden and transmission load. The stability analysis of the closed-loop multi-agent systems with event-triggered controller is described. Further, to implement the proposed scheme, an actor-critic neural network learning structure is proposed to approximate performance indices and to on-line learn the event-triggered optimal control. During the training process, event-triggered weight tuning law has been designed, wherein the weight parameters of the actor neural networks are adjusted only during triggering instances compared with traditional methods with fixed updating periods. Further, a convergence analysis of the actor-critic neural network is provided via Lyapunov method. Finally, two simulation examples show the effectiveness and performance of the obtained event-triggered reinforcement learning controller.					hu, jiangping/G-6897-2011	hu, jiangping/0000-0002-7559-8604; Shi, Kaibo/0000-0002-9863-9229; Peng, Zhinan/0000-0003-2239-4920													1549-8328	1558-0806				SEP	2022	69	9					3689	3700		10.1109/TCSI.2022.3177407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2022.3177407		JUN 2022											WOS:000805799200001
J	Hojjati, MR; Omidkhah, MR; Shahi, MHP				Hojjati, MR; Omidkhah, MR; Shahi, MHP			Cost effective heat exchanger network design with mixed materials of construction	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING-INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH EDITION												This paper presents a simple methodology for cost estimation of a near optimal heat exchanger network, which comprises mixed materials of construction. In traditional pinch technology and mathematical programming it is usually assumed that all heat exchangers in a network obey a single cost model. This implies that all heat exchangers in a network are of the same type and use the same materials of construction (an assumption that is unwarranted). The method introduced in this article enables the designer to decomposes the total cost of a heat exchanger into two elements, namely cost of the tubes and cost of the shell, thereby predict a more reliable cost for the network. By subsequent use of the binary variables and evaluation of the physical conditions of the streams, one can assign the streams to pass either through shell or tubes. Whereby, shell and tubes can be of different materials and there re different cost models can be applied Another advantage of the approach is that the pressure drop in each side of the exchanger (shell or tubes) can be assessed leading to more accurate evaluation of corresponding heat transfer coefficient for each individual stream. Finally an objective function (total cost) can be defined based on mixed materials of construction and different values of heat transfer coefficients. The proposed model has been utilized in three different case studies and the results are compared with those of a commercially available software (SUPERTARGET). The comparison shows reductions of more than 17% and 14% in total annual costs in the two cases, and 2.5% reduction in third, confirming the fact that more accurate evaluation of heat transfer coefficient for each individual stream can lead to better network design.

The manipulator and the control computer are connected through wireless communication links over which the position of the manipulator and the torque of the motor are transmitted. The virtual environment consists of multiple materials with different stiffness and damping that is termed as the mixed virtual wall. The contact point between the avatar and the virtual wall switches among different materials, where the movement is characterized by a stochastic process. To achieve the free oscillation for the haptic device with the human operator based on the passivity theory, the stability condition is established. After transforming the transparent virtual coupler design problem into an H-infinity optimization problem for a delayed jump linear system, we propose a design scheme for the switching virtual coupler. The performance of the proposed virtual coupler is verified and tested on the Phantom Omni haptic system.

Our approach is based on replacing the polytope by the set of its extreme points and generating the extreme points on the fly within row generation or column-and-row generation algorithms. The novelty of our approach lies in formulating the separation problem as a feasibility problem instead of a max-min problem as done in recent works. Applying the Farkas lemma, we can reformulate the separation problem as a bilinear program, which is then linearized to obtained a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. We compare the two algorithms on a robust telecommunications network design under demand uncertainty and budgeted uncertainty polytope. Our results show that the relative performance of the algorithms depend on whether the budget is integer or fractional.

So, only semi-globally uniformly ultimate boundedness of closed-loop systems can be guaranteed, and no methods are given to determine the neural network approximation domain. However, in this paper, it is showed that if neural networks are used as feedforward compensators instead of feedback ones, then we can ensure the globally uniformly ultimate boundedness of closed-loop systems and determine the neural network approximation domain via the bound of known reference signals. It should be pointed out that this domain is very important for designing the neural network structure, for example, it directly determines the choice of the centers of radial basis function neural networks.

An energy efficient clustering algorithm with optimum parameters is designed for reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the system lifetime. An analytical clustering model with one-hop distance and clustering angle is given. The optimum one-hop distance and clustering angle are formulated by minimizing the energy consumption between inter-cluster and intra-cluster. Furthermore, the continuous working mechanism of each cluster head which acts as the local control center and will not be replaced by the candidate cluster head until its continuous working times reach the optimum values is given, and the optimum continuous working times of each cluster head can be obtained through the optimum one-hop distance and the clustering angle. With the mechanism, the frequency of updating cluster head and the energy consumption for establishing new cluster head can be reduced. The simulation results demonstrate that the clustering algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption and increase the system lifetime. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

In spite of being the most widespread and longest used method, its technical development based on scientific analysis began only a few decades ago due to, among other reasons, the complexity of the phenomenon. Highly complex mathematical models have been developed, making difficult the design, management and evaluation of irrigation of this type. By basing future decisions on past experience, the artificial neural network models (ANNs) aim to find a solution and eliminate these complex mathematical models. In this paper, artificial neuronal networks are used to estimate performance parameters (potential application efficiency, distribution uniformity, deep percolation and runoff fractions) in the design and management of furrow irrigation in order to achieve required depth along the furrow. The data applied in the learning process of the artificial neuronal networks are derived from a volume balance model in which surface and subsurface storage factors are variable with time and obtained through a kinematic or mixed model. The results obtained suppose acceptable correlation coefficients (>0.88) as compared to the mixed model data. Validation is accomplished through a comparison with the SRFR model (Strelkoff, 1999).																					1-892769-13-1				2000							585	593																WOS:000177437000076

Conservation agencies tasked with reserve design may benefit from a dynamic decision system that provides tactical guidance for short-term decision opportunities while maintaining focus on a long-term objective of assembling the best set of protected areas possible. To plan cost-effective conservation over time under time-varying action costs and budget, we propose a multi-period mixed integer programming model for the budget-constrained selection of fully connected sites. The objective is to maximize a summed conservation value over all network parcels at the end of the planning horizon. The originality of this work is in achieving full spatial connectivity of the selected sites during the schedule of conservation actions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hospitals may provide medical services for acute and chronic diseases and injuries. However, continuous monitoring and long-term treatment becomes difficult in such type diseases. In this paper, continuous vital signs monitoring system (CVSMS) based on wireless body area network (WBAN) is designed. And the gathered data is transmitted to a mobile phone via Bluetooth and then transferred to a remote server and stored in the database. In this way, a variety of vital signs such as body temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, and ECG information would be acquired. Through the analysis and assessment of CVSMS, the results showed that the measurements are accurate and it provides an effective method for continuous health monitoring.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-39601-9; 978-3-319-39600-2				2016	9677						371	382		10.1007/978-3-319-39601-9_33	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-39601-9_33													WOS:000379294800033

Schematic-driven substrate noise coupling analysis in mixed-signal IC designs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS												This paper presents an approach to reduce substrate cross-talk noise between noisy and sensitive circuitry in mixed-signal integrated circuits at different stages of design and layout development. Silencer! a new, fully automated, schematic-driven substrate noise coupling analysis tool is introduced to accomplish this task. The tool seamlessly enables substrate noise coupling analysis in a standard mixed-signal design flow. Two different methods, fast scalable macro-models and a boundary element solver are integrated into Silencer!.

We assume that the government is interested in minimizing the overall risk of the shipments whereas the carriers minimize the route costs. In spite of the rich literature on hazmat transportation and of the relevance of this network design problem, it has received little attention and only quite recently. In this work we prove that the version of the hazmat transport network design problem where a subset of arcs can be forbidden is NP-hard even when a single commodity has to be shipped.

However, given the interaction of strategic decisions on tactical and operational decisions, it seems necessary to provide models that integrate these decisions. In this study, a mixed-integer non-linear programming model is developed to determine the optimal pricing of products in different sales and distribution channels while integrating location-allocation decisions and inventory control of distribution centers in an uncertain environment. In order to provide a more realistic model, it is assumed that there is a correlation between demands for products, which poses a critical challenge for modeling and pricing. A Memetic algorithm is used to solve the mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. The implementation results of the designed sample problems show the good performance of the proposed algorithm.

J	Hu, L; Liu, Y				Hu, Lu; Liu, Yang			Joint design of parking capacities and fleet size for one-way station-based carsharing systems with road congestion constraints	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												This paper formulates one-way station-based carsharing systems as a mixed queuing network model and proposes a profit-maximization model for the joint design of fleet size and station capacities. We explicitly model the road congestion by formulating each route as a queue where the travel time is an increasing function of the state. The booking process is also modeled in the rental station queue so that the efficiency loss caused by the reservation policy can be captured. The mixed queuing network falls into Baskett, Chandy, Muntz and Palacios (BCMP) networks with unique product-form equilibrium distribution. We derive the asymptotic behavior as the parking capacities and fleet size grows, and show that the performance of carsharing systems will be proportionally bounded by that of the bottleneck route. The exact mean value analysis (MVA) algorithm and the approximate Schweitzer-Bard mean value analysis (SB-MVA) algorithm are extended here to solve networks with different sizes. The numerical experiments reveal some interesting findings: (1) The higher customer service rate (the smaller pick-up time window) will generate the optimal design with lower parking capacities and lower fleet size; (2) Neglecting the efficiency loss due to reservation will lead to an overestimate of the profit and other system performances as well; and (3) Given different levels of congestion on the existing road network (the non-shared car traffic), the net revenue is maximized when the existing traffic congestion is moderate.

In a new approach, dynamical processes are modelled with closed-form continuous-depth artificial neural networks. Improved efficiency in training and inference is demonstrated on various sequence modelling tasks including human action recognition and steering in autonomous driving. Continuous-time neural networks are a class of machine learning systems that can tackle representation learning on spatiotemporal decision-making tasks. These models are typically represented by continuous differential equations. However, their expressive power when they are deployed on computers is bottlenecked by numerical differential equation solvers. This limitation has notably slowed down the scaling and understanding of numerous natural physical phenomena such as the dynamics of nervous systems. Ideally, we would circumvent this bottleneck by solving the given dynamical system in closed form. This is known to be intractable in general. Here, we show that it is possible to closely approximate the interaction between neurons and synapses-the building blocks of natural and artificial neural networks-constructed by liquid time-constant networks efficiently in closed form. To this end, we compute a tightly bounded approximation of the solution of an integral appearing in liquid time-constant dynamics that has had no known closed-form solution so far. This closed-form solution impacts the design of continuous-time and continuous-depth neural models. For instance, since time appears explicitly in closed form, the formulation relaxes the need for complex numerical solvers. Consequently, we obtain models that are between one and five orders of magnitude faster in training and inference compared with differential equation-based counterparts. More importantly, in contrast to ordinary differential equation-based continuous networks, closed-form networks can scale remarkably well compared with other deep learning instances. Lastly, as these models are derived from liquid networks, they show good performance in time-series modelling compared with advanced recurrent neural network models.

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings.

The main effect of the rapid growth of satellite networks is a broader range of data exchange and business interaction between the internal and external systems, making the network boundaries blur or even disappear. As a result, traditional passive security mechanisms based on dividing network boundaries cannot provide sufficient protection. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a zero-trust and edge intelligence (ZTEI) empowered continuous authentication for satellite networks. We build an improved zero-trust architecture (ZTA) for satellite networks, which expands the traditional zero-trust concept to the multi-dimensional zero-trust that focuses on subject, object, environment, behavior, and physical entity. Then we propose a continuous authentication scheme in the proposed zero-trust architecture, enabling proactive and continuous authentication by periodically monitoring and re-evaluating variable attributes throughout the request lifecycle. Besides, in this scheme, we also design a Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs) based edge intelligence algorithm to improve the authentication accuracy. Finally, we build a testbed to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture. Compared with the attribute-based access control (ABAC) under the traditional zero-trust architecture, our proposed architecture can improve the authentication accuracy of dynamic illegal requests by about 27%. In addition, according to standard network performance evaluation criteria, the loss of processing performance caused by our solution is also within an acceptable range.					chen, xian/KHW-2227-2024														2334-0983	2576-6813	978-1-6654-3540-6				2022							2376	2381		10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10000958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10000958													WOS:000922633502068

Energy Minimization of Discrete Protein Titration State Models Using Graph Theory	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												There are several applications in computational biophysics that require the optimization of discrete interacting states, for example, amino acid titration states, ligand oxidation states, or discrete rotamer angles. Such optimization can be very time-consuming as it scales exponentially in the number of sites to be optimized. In this paper, we describe a new polynomial time algorithm for optimization of discrete states in macromolecular systems. This algorithm was adapted from image processing and uses techniques from discrete mathematics and graph theory to restate the optimization problem in terms of "maximum flow-minimum cut" graph analysis. The interaction energy graph, a graph in which vertices (amino acids) and edges (interactions) are weighted with their respective energies, is transformed into a flow network in which the value of the minimum cut in the network equals the minimum free energy of the protein and the cut itself encodes the state that achieves the minimum free energy. Because of its deterministic nature and polynomial time performance, this algorithm has the potential to allow for the ionization state of larger proteins to be discovered.

Second, by the method of designing a state-feedback controller, sufficient conditions that the reachable set of the closed-loop system can be included in a given ellipsoid are obtained for admissible singularly perturbed parameters.

This article addresses the optimal design of a large-scale processing network for producing a variety of algae-based fuels and value-added bioproducts under uncertainty. We develop by far the most comprehensive processing network with 46,704 alternative processing pathways. Based on the superstructure, a two-stage adaptive robust mixed integer fractional programming model is proposed to tackle the uncertainty and select the robust optimal processing pathway with the highest ROI. Since the proposed problem cannot be solved directly by any off-the-shelf solver, we develop an efficient tailored solution method that integrates a parametric algorithm with a column-and-constraint generation algorithm. The resulting robust optimal processing pathway selects biodiesel and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate as the final fuel and bioproduct, respectively.

This continuous adjustment is done by a combination of Controllers, Stabilizers, Regulators, etc. This paper presents a design of decentralized controller based on neural network (NN) for multi-generator power system. NNs are used here to sense dynamic fault and reduce its effect by adjusting the weights considering current circumstances. This controller deals with dynamic faults of a large decentralized power system occurred from load changes. The controller is trained by previous values of voltage, frequency and power but controller's inputs are instantaneous system signals. This ensures the dynamic and overall system stability. Simulation studies with IEEE-14 bus power system are used to display the virtue of the proposed controller designs.																			2378-2668		978-1-5386-0869-2				2017							601	606																WOS:000428083300113

Synthesis of Reconfigurable Antenna Array Using Differential Evolution Algorithm	IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH												Presently certain applications demand two or more radiation patterns by using a single antenna array due to miniature and cost effective measures of the device. Hence, reconfigurable array is suitable for this purpose. This paper presents differential evolution (DE) algorithm based design of a reconfigurable antenna array. This method effectively obtains the optimum phase weights for efficient antenna performance in dual mode. The problem attempted is to find an optimal common amplitude weight distribution with minimum amplitude range ratio. 4-bit discrete amplitudes and 5-bit discrete phases have been considered to simplify the design of the array feed network. Based on simulation results, it is established that DE-based reconfigurable antenna array design provides better performance in terms of side lobe levels and null steering.

Some of these newer codecs used the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) instead of the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT). This paper explores the choice of wavelet packet transform (WPT) for an application for a new scalable speech codec for IP networks using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to encode the core-layer coding error in the enhancement layer. The issues regarding the design and in particular the choice of wavelet for the wideband codec are discussed. Experimental simulation results show that the DWT is a promising technique to use for encoding highly non-stationary signals such as the speech coding error. The wideband codec achieved speech quality equivalent to ITU-G.718 and similar codecs and is more robust. We also show that the best choice of wavelet depends on many factors including the order and number of levels of the wavelet tree, delay and how well it approximates the human auditory system.

First, we define a suitable function and then derive the optimal control law with control constraints and the worst disturbance law. Besides, the constrained Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation for continuous-time nonlinear constrained systems is derived. Then, only one critic neural network is used to approximate the optimal cost function. Consequently, the approximate optimal control law and the approximate worst disturbance law are obtained. Additionally, a new updating rule is developed in the process of neural critic learning. Finally, the simulation results show that the self-learning optimal control is realized and the effectiveness of the disturbance rejection is verified by using the neural-network-based ADP method.

Although the most important causes of inequality are natural or geographical reasons, the lack of energy supply-demand balance specific to the region causes inequality to increase. Undoubtedly, eliminating the supply-demand imbalance as a result of the increase in energy demand by costing energy cheaply will play a major role in reducing these differences. To meet the energy demand, the existing electricity grid may need to be expanded or partially or completely replaced. The aim of the studies to design a new electricity network or to expand an existing network; to meet the needs of consumers by providing energy distribution with minimum cost and maximum quality. In this study; energy costs generated by re-planning in a network that distributes electricity at different voltage levels to meet the increasing energy needs were analysed. To obtain the optimum network design; a minimization function was established by determining the required transformer powers and their numbers considering the physical and electrical conditions. The generated function was analysed by using a mixed-integer programming algorithm and genetic algorithm in MATLAB.

The channels for transmitting control input signals and receiving information agent are assumed to be independent of each other and both can be destroyed by frequently occurred attacks. After the attacks, a repairing cell will be instantly activated until the communication topology is restored to the initial state. Assume that broken-down nodes remain partial function. Moreover, feedback gain matrices and coupling strengths will be designed by some algorithms. By dint of geometrical method and inequality technique, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee robust synchronization for the complex cyberphysical networks.

The strategy effectively exploits the Smith principle in order to avoid data loss in the network, and to ensure full utilisation of the bottleneck link available bandwidth. The desirable properties of the proposed control strategy are preserved, even though the connection round trip times may be determined imprecisely. Furthermore, an enhanced strategy, which employs extra feed-forward bandwidth compensation, and reduces the influence of the available bandwidth variations on the steady state queue length in the network, is introduced. Finally, the proposed strategy is modified to be appropriate for application when the number of active connections changes during the control process, and new conditions for no data loss and full bandwidth utilisation are formulated and strictly proved. Since the modified strategy allows for arbitrary resource allocation among the controlled virtual circuits, the max-min fairness criteria can be satisfied.

We describe an active network architecture for multimedia communications. We introduce the novel concept of QaS-Message, which is specified by a flexible, high-level Petri net called the G-Net. Extensive research has been done at the University of Pittsburgh and elsewhere to study the property of C-Net and its application in the design of complex, reliable real-time systems. We adopt the G-Net for QoS-message specification. An active network architecture is describe so that based upon the feedback from the network, the optimizing transformation of G-Nets enables the continuous adaptation of QoS-messages when the network environment changes dynamically. The approach guarantees continuous communication over a combined wired and wireless environment. A prototype active multimedia communication system is being developed at the University of Pittsburgh. This research provides a basis for QoS-message specification, dynamic QoS-message construction, a channel model and an active network architecture for adaptive multimedia communication.																					0-8186-7629-9				1997							194	194																WOS:A1997BJ54M00027

Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.																					978-1-4244-1395-9				2007							251	257																WOS:000253972100043

Delay Distributions in Discrete Time Multiclass Tandem Communication Network Models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING SYSTEMS												An exact computational algorithm for the solution of a discrete time multiclass tandem network with a primary class and cross-traffic at each queue is developed. A sequence of truncated Lindley recursions is defined at each queue relating the delays experienced by the first packet from consecutive batches of a class at that queue. Using this sequence of recursions, a convolve-and-sweep algorithm is developed to compute the stationary distributions of the delay and inter-departure processes of each class at a queue, delays experienced by a typical packet from the primary class along its path as well as the mean end-to-end delay of such a packet. The proposed approach is designed to handle the non-renewal arrival processes arising in the network. The algorithmic solution is implemented as an abstract class which permits its easy adaptation to analyze different network configurations and sizes. The delays of a packet at different queues are shown to be associated random variables from which it follows that the variance of total delay is lower bounded by the sum of variances of delays at the queues along the path. The developed algorithm and the proposed lower bound on the variance of total delay are validated against simulation for a tandem network of two queues with three classes under different batch size distributions.																			1847-6996	1847-7003					2022	13	6					417	425																WOS:000884682700001

Development of an adaptive radial basis function neural network estimator-based continuous sliding mode control for uncertain nonlinear systems	ISA TRANSACTIONS												In this paper an adaptive neural network (NN)-based nonlinear controller is proposed for trajectory tracking of uncertain nonlinear systems. The adopted control algorithm combines a continuous second-order sliding mode control (CSOSMC), the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and the adaptive control methodology. First, a second-order sliding mode control scheme (SOSMC), which is published recently in literature for linear uncertain systems, is extended for nonlinear uncertain systems. Second, an adaptive radial basis function neural network estimator-based continuous second order sliding mode control algorithm (CSOSMC-ANNE) is adopted. In CSOSMC-ANNE control methodology, a radial basis function neural network with adaptive parameters is exploited to approximate the unknown system parameters and improve performance against perturbations. Also, the discontinuous switching control of SOSMC is supplanted with a smooth continuous control action to completely eliminate the chattering phenomenon. The convergence and global stability of the closed-loop system are proved using Lyapunov stability method. Numerical computer simulations, with dynamical model of the nonlinear inverted pendulum system, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the presented control scheme.

Zonotopic multi-sensor fusion estimation with mixed delays under try-once-discard protocol: A set-membership framework	INFORMATION FUSION												In this paper, the fusion estimation problem is investigated for a class of multi-sensor networked systems with unknown-but-bounded noises and mixed time-delays under try-once-discard protocols (TODPs). The measurements of multiple sensor nodes are sent to the remote fusion center through individual network channels, where the TODP is implemented in each channel to schedule the signal transmissions for the purpose of avoiding data collisions. To fuse the information collected from all channels, a sequential estimator is proposed whose estimator parameters are designed such that the estimation error (after each measurement update) is restrained into a zonotope with minimum F-radius at each moment. First, by using the properties of zonotopes, desired zonotopes are obtained that contain the estimation errors, and the F-radii of these zonotopes are subsequently minimized by appropriately designing the estimator parameters. It is shown that, under the proposed zonotopes-based fusion rule, the designed sequential estimator leads to the same estimation accuracy as that of the widely utilized parallel estimator. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to verify the validity of the developed fusion estimation method.

A total of 43 mix designs were meticulously examined to explore the relationships between these properties. Quantitative analysis employed a backpropagation neural network model with a single hidden layer to accurately predict the resistant and durable characteristics of self-compacting concrete. The optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined using a fitting component selection method, implemented in MATLAB software(2021b). Additionally, qualitative analysis was conducted using sensitivity analysis and expert opinions to determine the priority of research additives. The main contributions of this paper lie in the exploration of SCC properties, the utilization of a neural network model for accurate prediction, and the prioritization of research additives through sensitivity analysis. The neural network model demonstrated exceptional performance in predicting test results, achieving a high accuracy rate using 14 neurons for predicting parameters such as chlorine penetration depth, compressive strength, migration coefficient, and specific electrical resistance. Sensitivity analysis revealed that xanthan gum emerged as the most influential additive, accounting for 43% of the observed effects, followed by nanomaterials at 35% and micro-silica at 21%.																				2075-5309				OCT	2023	13	10							2605	10.3390/buildings13102605	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings13102605													WOS:001094053900001

Also, it allows for reduced wiring, as well as a lower installation cost. It also permits greater agility in diagnosis and maintenance procedures. Therefor, some problem such as time delay, data package loss, may accur in the network. Transmission, which can make the analysis to NCS a difficult task. Because the classical control theory can not be directly applied to NCS controller design. Whereafter, a delay compensation arithmetic is studied to reduce or eliminate the influence of the network transmission to the control computing. Also, the necessary and sufficient conditions for this kind of NCS stability are derivated. It is proved that networked delay can be compensated by state prediction arithmetic by the use of simulation.					sun, he/IYJ-6174-2023																				2008							290	293		10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605577													WOS:000259746400062

Due to the limited capacities of network medium, a logarithmic quantizer is applied to the underlying systems. Considering the fact that the filter is realized through a network, randomly occurring parameter uncertainties of the filter are modeled by two mode-dependent Bernoulli processes. By establishing the mode-dependent periodic Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are given to ensure the stability and dissipativity of the filtering error system. The filter parameters are derived via solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. The merits and validity of the proposed design techniques are verified by a simulation example.

RdM entails the shift from centralized mass production systems towards decentralized geographically dispersed smaller manufacturing facilities, empowered by new information and communication technologies and characterized by personalization and active consumer role. The aim of this paper is to survey and analyse the extant literature that addresses the design of RdM networks in order to identify different models, tools and approaches proposed to design RdM networks. As the adoption of an RdM paradigm is appealing and promising, it is important to bring together and analyse previous studies in RdM networks design, as well as to borrow theories from other well-established areas and incorporate them into the RdM network design field. The paper begins with an overview on the RdM paradigm; its benefits, challenges and opportunities. A survey of the state of the art on RdM networks design, and challenges and shortcomings with the identified approaches are presented. Finally the paper concludes with a summary section and future research directions.

We first explain the key aspects of the problem, emphasizing the fact that in IP networks the routing algorithms are an input to the optimization problem, not an optimization target. We then provide a mixed integer linear programming formulation of the optimization problem, which however leads to unacceptably high complexity for networks of non-trivially small size. We then propose both greedy and metaheuristic approaches for the sub-optimal design of logical topologies with acceptable complexity. Finally, we derive lower bounds that allow the assessment of the performance of the proposed algorithms. Some numerical results indicate that the proposed metaheuristics largely outperform the greedy approaches, and are able to obtain very good logical topologies.

J	Mannarino, A; Mantegazza, P				Mannarino, Andrea; Mantegazza, Paolo			Nonlinear aerodynamic reduced order modeling by discrete time recurrent neural networks	AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nowadays, viable estimations of transonic aerodynamic loads can be obtained through the tools of computational fluid dynamics. Nonetheless, even with the increasing available computer power, the cost of solving the related non-linear, large order models still impedes their widespread use in conceptual/preliminary aircraft design phases, whereas the related nonlinearities might critically affect design decisions. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop methods capable of providing adequately precise reduced order models, compressing large order aerodynamic systems within a highly reduced number of states. This work tackles such a problem through a discrete time recursive neural network formulation, identifying compact models through a training based on input-output data obtained from high-fidelity simulations of the aerodynamic problem alone. The soundness of such an approach is verified by first evaluating the aerodynamic loads resulting from the harmonic motion of an airfoil in transonic regime and then checking aeroelastic limit cycle oscillations inferred from such a reduced neural system against high fidelity response analyses.

Microbial ecology investigates the function of microorganisms in the environment. Towards understanding the role of microorganisms in important ecosystem processes, one example is considered. The presented example is focused on continuous yeasts growth prediction by the developed software analyzer, which helps to discover the influence of initial formaldehyde concentrations on the continuous cell growth, correlated with the protein-synthesizing ability (A,[h(-1)]) of yeasts strain Candida didensii 74-10 at two different dilution rates (D,[h(-1)]). The Levenberg-Marquardt optimization technique has been used to upgrade the network by minimizing the sum square error (SSE). The performance of the network with two hidden layers for predicting cell mass and protein synthesizing ability is found to be very effective.																					978-960-6766-56-5				2008							48	+																WOS:000257699300010

On-demand pressurized water distribution system impacts on sprinkler network design and performance	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												On-farm irrigation networks are designed for optimum performance at a specific upstream pressure head. In pressurized water distribution systems operating on demand, the upstream pressure head of the on-farm network can be subject to high and continuous fluctuations depending on the number of the hydrants being simultaneously opened. In this paper, a methodology combining network design and performance analysis of a sprinkler network is described and applied to an irrigation distribution system operating at two different water demands (1,200 and 600 l s(-1)) using a case study in Italy. Four designs of the same sprinkler network were optimized at different upstream designing pressure and were evaluated at all the possible operating conditions of the system. The expensive large pipe size diameter design presented the best performance and the highest reliability at a wide range of hydrant pressure while the small pipe size designs have the tendency to fail during the peak water demand period as a result of low hydrant pressure. Flow regulators within the hydrants showed to have an important role in stabilizing the network performance at elevated upstream pressure head.

The methodology is based on an MINLP (mixed integer nonlinear programming) model, identification of critical points, and flexibility index analysis considering phase changes. A nominal multiperiod HEN topology is constructed in the first step. Then each process operating condition's critical points and flexibility index are calculated to verify the feasibility of the designed HEN under multiple operating conditions. To verify the validity of the method, the proposed methodology will be applied to a case study on an ammonia synthesis process heat transfer network design based on renewable energy.

This is achieved by solving only one constrained optimization problem which considers the exchanger model equations (heat transfer and mixing) and constraints (resiliency index, heat load and the minimum approach temperature) simultaneously for all possible predefined disturbance directions.

Such a full duplex radio is being considered as a potential candidate for the next generation of wireless networks due to its ability to increase the spectral efficiency of wireless systems. In this paper, the performance of full duplex radio in small cellular systems is analyzed by assuming full duplex capable base stations and half duplex user equipment. However, using only full duplex base stations increases interference leading to outage. We therefore propose a mixed multi-cell system, composed of full duplex and half duplex cells. A stochastic geometry based model of the proposed mixed system is provided, which allows us to derive the outage and area spectral efficiency of such a system. The effect of full duplex cells on the performance of the mixed system is presented under different network parameter settings. We show that the fraction of cells that have full duplex base stations can be used as a design parameter by the network operator to target an optimal tradeoff between area spectral efficiency and outage in a mixed system.

By constructing a delay-product-type Lyapunov functional, in which the information of time-varying delays and characteristics of activation functions are fully taken into account, and using the Jensen summation inequality, the free weighting matrix approach, and the extended reciprocally convex matrix inequality, some sufficient conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities to ensure the existence of the state estimator.

By using prediction functions of future states, the pure-feedback system is transformed into an n-step-ahead predictor, based on which state feedback NN control is synthesized. Next, by investigating the relationship between outputs and states, the system is transformed into an input-output predictor model, and then, output feedback control is constructed. To overcome the difficulty of nonaffine appearance of the control input, implicit function theorem is exploited in the control design and NN is employed to approximate the unknown function in the control. In both state feedback and output feedback control, only a single NN is used and the controller singularity is completely avoided. The closed-loop system achieves semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) stability and the output tracking error is made within a neighborhood around zero. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.

The design and simulation of power network is considered in MATLAB/Simulink environment to analyze various faults (HIF, Symmetrical, and unsymmetrical), and non-fault events. In pre-process stage of classification, the features from current signals of different events are extracted by using discrete wavelet transform technique. Then, features are used to learn the RS ensemble and base classifiers (K-nearest neighbor, Logistic regression, and Random tree) to get predictions in classification phase. The classification analysis is carried out under with and without real-time varying solar irradiance, and addition of noise data over the input of classifiers. The proposed RS ensemble classifier, discriminates HIF with higher accuracy and success rate than base classifiers.

First, we design an observer-based residual generator, and model the residual dynamics to be a discrete-time markovian jump linear system in this paper. By using H-infinity optimization theory and linear matrix in- equation approach, the solution of alarm threshold is proposed. Then we introduce a new index to design a fault detection filter, which improves the performance of dynamic system, the sensitivity of the detection system to the fault.

J	Xu, HL; Mao, XR				Xu, Henglei; Mao, Xuerong			Structured stabilisation of superlinear delay systems by bounded discrete-time state feedback control	AUTOMATICA												Taking different system structures in different Markovian modes into consideration, this paper studies the structured stabilisation of a class of superlinear hybrid stochastic delay systems by feedback control based on discrete-time state observations. The controller is designed in a bounded state area, rather than every observable state, in order to reduce control cost. The time delay is more general in terms of the classical differentiability assumption being relaxed. Compared with the existing papers on discrete-state-feedback stabilisation problem, a new method to estimate the difference between current-time state and discrete-time state is presented, as a result of which the conditions imposed on the underlying system and the control function are less restrictive. Meanwhile, the Lyapunov functional used in this paper is modified to adapt to this change. Finally, an application to stochastic structured neural networks is given to demonstrate the practicability of the developed theory.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Each connection in the considered networks is characterized by a time delay and a packet loss ratio. The proposed controller takes advantage of an appropriately designed sliding hyperplane, which ensures the closed-loop system stability and finite-time error convergence to zero. Moreover, the proposed controller ensures full utilization of the bottleneck link available bandwidth, guarantees bounded transmission rates, and eliminates the risk of buffer overflow in the bottleneck node. The proposed controller is designed using the concept of the reaching law, which helps to limit data transmission rates in the network.

Even small instances of this combined problem are extremely difficult to solve due to the presence of a large number of 0-1 variables. This problem suffers from the inherent limitations imposed by classical algorithms like the branch and bound algorithm for finding integer solutions. Several heuristic algorithms have been proposed to circumvent this setback but the performance of these heuristic algorithms varies with the type of traffic and other network related constraints. In this paper we have presented a Tabu search based approach to solve the logical topology design problem. We have compared our results with branch and bound and HALDA, a heuristic topology design algorithm.																					1-4020-7389-5				2003	727						129	143																WOS:000183254500019

Then, the robust counterpart of the presented model is developed to deal with the inherent uncertainty of input parameters.

The network design has to be feasible and optimal over a given set of scenarios in which different operational conditions hold. We propose a superstructure whose optimization is formulated as a multiscenario non-convex Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MrNLP) problem. A spatial branch and cut algorithm is proposed that uses Lagrangean decomposition for global optimization of the large multiscenario model. An example is presented for the global optimization of an integrated network operating under uncertainty using the proposed algorithm.																			1570-7946		978-0-444-52969-5				2006	21						1747	1752																WOS:000287727700281

I first describe my methodological worldview in which the meaning of context is continuously negotiated by participants from sociocultural perspectives. I explain how pragmatic and dialectical stances strengthen the use of a mixed methods approach to capturelearning in context. I argue for the combination of link and trajectory analyses to analyze interactions from learners' perspectives. I illustrate how the combination of critical discourse analysis and social network analysis enables researchers to trace a trajectory of learning and discover what has changed over time. I discuss equity, reflexivity, and trustworthiness when conducting DBR. I conclude by presenting the limitations of this combined method while indicating future tasks and directions for using a mixed methods approach in DBR.

Profit-Based Sensor Network Design Using the Generalized Benders Decomposition	2017 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)	Proceedings of the American Control Conference				American Control Conference (ACC)	MAY 24-26, 2017	Seattle, WA	GE Global Res, Mitsubishi Elect Res Labs, Eaton, United Technologies Res Ctr, MathWorks, Amer Automat Control Council				The problem of profit-based sensor network design for linear systems has been shown to be of the nonconvex mixed integer programming class. The branch and bound search procedure can be used to obtain a global solution, but such a method is limited to fairly small systems. The bottleneck is that in each iteration of the branch and bound search, a fairly slow Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) problem must be solved to its global optimum. In this paper, we demonstrate that an equivalent reformulation of the nonconvex mixed integer programming problem and subsequent application of the Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD) algorithm will result in massive computational effort reductions. While the proposed algorithm has to solve multiple mixed integer linear programs, this increase in computational effort is significantly outweighed by the reduction of SDP problems that must be solved.																			0743-1619	2378-5861	978-1-5090-5992-8				2017							3894	3899																WOS:000427033303154

As a result, such programmable networks make the deployment of in-network AI possible for achieving predictive maintenance, which in turn enables the much desired (sound-based) time-critical anomaly detection in modern smart factories. However, such abnormal sound detection systems face high computational complexity due to their high density and multi-source nature. In this paper, we present our novel You only hear once (Yoho) design for multi-target anomalous sound detection and end-to-end feature extraction. Yoho can detect anomalies directly from a mixed multi-source acoustic signal without recovering each source data. In addition, with a lightweight dual-path backbone design (Yoho-Dual-Path), we achieve low model complexity and high detection accuracy. Our experiments show that the proposed solution can reduce the inference time by 77% and improve the detection accuracy by 51%. This enables the integration of intelligent anomalous sound detection systems into the network.

Using simulation it is possible to explore different protocols and design options, under different loads, long before the design is frozen. However, such simulations can be time consuming, especially if a large number of scenarios are to be considered. In this paper we show how it is possible to perform distributed execution of a network simulation written for the OpNet package. This is performed using a distributed completing tool called Cluster. Very high efficiency has been experienced on a variety of workstation clusters.

Distinct from the existing correlative results, a novel synchronization paradigm is established, in which the designed synchronization controller only contains the information of neuron states and switching signal at the certain triggering instants scheduled by the designed dynamic event-triggered mechanism. Also, an interesting asynchronous problem caused by the asynchronization of the switching and triggering actions is taken into consideration. For reducing the conservativeness of the conventional approaches, the time-dependent Lyapunov- Krasovskii functional for the resultant asynchronous situation is then constructed, and the correspondent sufficient conditions are formulated to ensure the exponential stability and weighted l(2)-l(infinity)., performance of the concerned synchronization error systems.

PNs are well-known mathematical and graphical models that are widely used to describe distributed DESs, including choices, synchronizations and parallelisms. The domains of application include, but are not restricted to, manufacturing systems, computer science and transportation networks. We are motivated by the observation that such systems need to plan their production or services. The paper is more particularly concerned with control issues in uncertain environments when unexpected events occur or when control errors disturb the behaviour of the system. To deal with such uncertainties, a new approach based on discrete time Markov decision processes (MDPs) has been proposed that associates the modelling power of PNs with the planning power of MDPs.

In this work, a light-weight and reliable trust mechanism based on the improved LightGBM algorithm is originally proposed to evaluate the credibility of edge devices. First, we design a light-weight trust mechanism for edge devices to process raw interaction data and extract trust features, which reduces the amount of data transmission and the pressure on the communication networks. In addition, an evaluation algorithm based on the entropy weight method (EWM) and punishment factors is designed for edge brokers to distinguish the malicious devices from the normal ones, which performs great against mixed malicious attacks. At last, we propose an improved LightGBM algorithm developed in the centralized cloud to learn other researchers' evaluation methods and check the evaluation uploaded from edge brokers, which could make the punishment factors of edge networks weighted adaptively with the change of edge networks. The experimental results show the proposed trust mechanism outperforms existing methods in the accuracy and discriminating speed under mixed malicious attacks.																			1092-1648		978-1-7281-2700-2				2019										10.1109/icnp.2019.8888037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icnp.2019.8888037													WOS:000556143800005

Sensor nodes are physically distributed and communicated through network medium. Firstly, a distributed event-triggered communication scheme is presented to determine when the measurement output on each sensor node should be broadcast and transmitted to its neighboring nodes. Each sensor node is equipped with an event monitor which consists of an event generator and a store. The event generator is configured to produce a series of events according to an event triggering rule. The store is employed to reserve the latest data packets. Secondly, based on the Lyapunov functional approach, criteria for analyzing H-infinity filtering performance and designing desired distributed event-triggered H-infinity filters are derived such that the resultant filtering error system is asymptotically stable with a prescribed H-infinity performance index. The filter design problem is posed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

The hierarchical hybrid feature consists of a higher level nondeterministic switching and a lower level stochastic switching. The latter is used to describe the NNs subject to Markovian modes transitions, whereas the former is of the average dwell-time switching regularity to model the supervisory orchestrating mechanism among these Markov jump NNs. The considered time delays are not only time-varying but also dependent on the mode of NNs on the lower layer in the hierarchical structure. Despite quantization and random data missing, the synchronized controllers and state estimators are designed such that the resulting error system is exponentially stable with an expected decay rate and has a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. Two numerical examples are provided to show the validity and potential of the developed results.					zheng, wei/IQT-9639-2023; WU, ZHEN/GRN-7688-2022; Zhang, Lixian/G-3614-2014	WU, ZHEN/0000-0001-8719-057X; Zheng, Wei Xing/0000-0002-0572-5938													2162-237X	2162-2388				FEB	2016	27	2			SI		459	470		10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2412676	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2412676								25823045					WOS:000372020500022

However, this paradoxically causes a prolonged execution time. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an advanced integrated modeling method for the communication analysis in the NCW via the transformation of the SoS, which reduces the simulation execution time while ensuring the accuracy of the communication effects. The proposed models mainly cover interentity traffic and intraentity mobility developed in the form of feed-forward neural networks to guarantee two-way interactions between the combat system and the network system. Because they are characterized as discrete events, the proposed models are designed with the discrete-event system specification (DEVS) formalism. The experimental results show that the proposed transformation reduced an error by 6.40% compared to the existing method and reduced the execution time 3.78-fold compared to the SoS-based NCW simulation.

After time-advance operation on output of such systems, the output dynamics nonlinearly depends on the control input. To address this issue, we use implicit function theory to define the relative degrees, and to establish a normal form. Then, an implicit function equation solution-based control scheme and an iterative solution-based control scheme are proposed, which ensure not only the closed-loop stability but also the output tracking for the controlled plant. An adaptive control framework for the controlled plant with uncertainties is also presented to illustrate the basic design procedure.

Nowadays, ICS network designers need to accommodate a variety of devices and communication media/protocols with industry-specific requirements pertaining to real-time delivery of data packets, reliability, and resilience of communication networks. Therefore, this work proposes a novel network design methodology formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The developed problem accounts for different data flows routed across an overlay network of concentrators and embodies traditional ICS design requirements defined as linear constraints. Furthermore, the MILP problem defines a K-resilience factor to ensure the installation of K back-up paths, and a linear reliability constraint adapted from the field of fuzzy logic optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed MILP problem.

This paper proposes a twin deterministic policy gradient adaptive dynamic programming (TDPGADP) algorithm to solve the optimal control problem for a discrete-time affine nonlinear system in a model-free scenario. To solve the overestimation problem resulted from function approximation errors, the minimum value between the double Q network is taken to update the control policy. The convergence of the proposed algorithm in which the value function is served as the Lyapunov function is verified. By designing a twin actor-critic network structure, combining the target network and a specially designed adaptive experience replay mechanism, the algorithm is convenient to implement and the sample efficiency of the learning process can be improved. Two simulation examples are conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.					zhong, yanjiu/JRX-6216-2023; xu, jiahui/KLZ-8859-2024; zhao, shangwei/GXG-2998-2022	zhong, yanjiu/0000-0002-4361-9378; zhao, shangwei/0000-0001-7786-3857; xu, jiahui/0000-0002-4058-0447													1598-6446	2005-4092				SEP	2022	20	9					3098	3109		10.1007/s12555-021-0473-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12555-021-0473-6		AUG 2022											WOS:000842593500002

To overcome the difficulty of random fluctuation and communication constraints, a novel and highly flexible form of estimator is designed by considering random uncertainty, signal quantization and data packet dropout phenomena simultaneously. The considered mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) switching law is shown to be more general than the traditional ADT for permitting each subsystem to has its own average dwell time. By constructing the MD Lyapunov-Krasovaskii functional (LKF), sufficient conditions are given to ensure the exponential mean-square stability and extended stochastic dissipativity of the augmented system and an explicit expression of the desired estimator is presented. Finally, a example with two cases is provide to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the studied systems, three types of complexities, namely, the additive nonlinearities, the RRP, and the output feedback form of controllers, are simultaneously taken into consideration. To tackle these complexities, an approximate dynamic programing (ADP) algorithm is first developed for NE control strategies by solving the coupled Bellman's equation. Then, a Luenberger-type observer is designed under the RRP scheduling to estimate the system states. The near-NE control strategies are implemented via the actor-critic neural networks. More importantly, the stability analysis of the closed-loop system is conducted to guarantee that the studied system with the proposed control strategies is bounded stable.

To overcome the function approximation errors, initial resetting errors and undesired chattering behavior, a time-varying boundary layer is introduced to design an auxiliary error function. Based on the auxiliary error function, the fuzzy neural networks in this AILC are used as an approximators to compensate for the plant unknown nonlinearities. Since the optimal parameters for a good function approximation are unavailable, the adaptive algorithms are derived to guarantee the closed-loop stability and learning convergence. Based on a Lyapunov like analysis, we show that all the adjustable parameters as well as internal signals are bounded for all iterations. The norm of output tracking error vector will asymptotically converge to a residual set bounded by the width of boundary layer as iteration goes to infinity.																					978-1-4673-2056-6				2012							101	106																WOS:000326810700017

J	Lui, YL; Shen, GX; Shao, WD				Lui, Yunlei; Shen, Gangxiang; Shao, Weidong			Design for Energy-Efficient IP Over WDM Networks With Joint Lightpath Bypass and Router-Card Sleeping Strategies	JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING												To reduce the energy consumption of the Internet, much research effort has been dedicated to the design of energy-minimized IP over WDM networks. In this study, we design energy-minimized IP over WDM networks based on modular router cards and by jointly applying the lightpath bypass and router-card sleeping strategies. As a key advantage, the design does not require rerouting of IP flows or optical channels in either the IP or optical layer. Rather, to save energy, we only need to sleep or wake up the router cards according to user traffic demands when applying the sleeping strategy, which significantly simplifies the network control and management. To minimize the total energy consumption of the IP over WDM network in a time period (e.g., 1 day), we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Moreover, to alleviate the computational complexity of the MILP model, we divide the minimization problem into two subproblems, namely, 1) establishing a virtual topology and 2) allocating router ports on router cards to the optical channels on different virtual links. For each of the subproblems, we develop a separate MILP optimization model. Further, for large-network design, we also propose two efficient heuristics to optimize energy consumption. Simulation studies indicate that the joint MILP model with the lightpath bypass and router-card sleeping strategies can maximally reduce energy consumption, up to 40% compared to the nonsleeping case. In addition, under the router-card sleeping strategy, the approach of allocating the router ports on different router cards to the optical channels plays an important role in the design of an energy-minimized IP over WDM network. A mixed mode that jointly performs interleaving and sequential router-port allocations can achieve the highest energy savings.

Unlike the existing works, a fuzzy memory pinning impulsive control (FMPIC) approach is proposed. In order to conquer the difficulties of studying such general system, sufficient conditions that depend on the discrete-delay and distributed-delay impulsive effects are obtained by employing the Lyapunov function, inequality techniques and stochastic analysis theory. It is shown that the PS of FDCDNs can be achieved under the designed FMPIC. Numerical simulation on basis of BA scale-free coupled network is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

The approach is based on interpreting the function as a controlled object, namely one that has an output (the function value) that has to be driven to its smallest value by suitable manipulation of its inputs: this is achieved by the use of the control Liapunov function (CLF) technique, well known in systems and control theory. This approach leads naturally to the design of second-order differential equations which are the mathematical models of the corresponding implementations as neural networks. Preliminary numerical simulations indicate that, on a small suite of benchmark test problems, a continuous version of the well known conjugate gradient algorithm, designed by the proposed CLF method, has better performance than its competitors, such as the heavy ball with friction method or the more recent dynamic inertial Newton-like method.

A major challenge with sensor network hardware is their limited available energy resource, which makes the low power design of these sensors important. This paper aims to present a low power sensor which can detect sound waveform signatures. Design/methodology/approach - A novel mixed signal hardware is presented to correlate the received sound signal with a specific sound signal template. The architecture uses pulse width modulation and a single bit digital delay line to propagate the input signal over time and analog current multiplier units to perform template matching with low power usage. Findings - The proposed method is evaluated for a chainsaw signature detection application in forest environments, under different supply voltage values, input signal quantization levels and also different template sample points. It is observed that an appropriate combination of these parameters can optimize the power and accuracy of the presented method. Originality/value - The proposed mixed signal architecture allows voltage and power reduction compared with conventional methods. A network of these sensors can be used to detect sound signatures in energy limited environments. Such applications can be found in the detection of chainsaw and gunshot sounds in forests to prevent illegal logging and hunting activities.

This work develops SeQUeNCe, a comprehensive, customizable quantum network simulator. Our simulator consists of five modules: hardware models, entanglement management protocols, resource management, network management, and application. This framework is suitable for simulation of quantum network prototypes that capture the breadth of current and future hardware technologies and protocols. We implement a comprehensive suite of network protocols and demonstrate the use of SeQUeNCe by simulating a photonic quantum network with nine routers equipped with quantum memories. The simulation capabilities are illustrated in three use cases. We show the dependence of quantum network throughput on several key hardware parameters and study the impact of classical control message latency. We also investigate quantum memory usage efficiency in routers and demonstrate that redistributing memory according to anticipated load increases network capacity by 69.1% and throughput by 6.8%. We design SeQUeNCe to enable comparisons of alternative quantum network technologies, experiment planning, and validation and to aid with new protocol design.

To overcome this, a novel data-based optimal temperature tracking control is designed for CMHS in this paper. In order to obtain the complex dynamics of CMHS, a neural network model is first constructed driven by process data. After transforming the original temperature tracking problem into an error regulation problem, adaptive dynamic programming is introduced to deal with the regulation problem as well as to decrease operation cost. The design and operation of this controller depend mainly on the online data, and minor prior knowledge is required. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively control the CMHS in terms of temperature tracking and energy utilization.

J	Tian, JD; He, GF				Tian, Jiandong; He, Guifang			A New Approach to the Optimal Design of a Reclaimed Urban Water Reuse System	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												It is strategically important to optimize the pipe network used for reclaimed urban water reuse. A large and complex system model is developed, with the minimum total annual cost of the pumping station and pipe engineering as objective functions, the head loss in the divided pipe segment as the coupling constraint, the economic flow velocity and the optimal diameter of a standard pipe as feasible domain constraints, and the design head and diameter of the pipe as decision variables. The problem is solved by combining the ratio of the discrete enumeration of the design head to the decomposition-dynamic programming aggregation of the large-scale system. This strategy can solve the problem of the optimal pipe diameter in each section of the pipe network engineering under a fixed design head of the pressurized pumping station. On this basis, the annual cost of reclaimed water reuse pipe network engineering is compared under the different design heads of the pressurized pumping stations, allowing the optimal design scheme for reclaimed water reuse pipe network engineering to be obtained. At the same time, the optimal design head of the pressurized pumping station and the optimal pipe diameter of each section can be identified. This can provide a theoretical reference for the optimal design of urban and rural water pipe networks.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2020	34	5					1789	1807		10.1007/s11269-020-02532-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-020-02532-5		APR 2020											WOS:000522894800001

However traditional collaborative methods can not be applied to WSN directly. In this paper, we focus on coalition-based method of multi-nodes collaboration (CMMC) which is performed to achieve a maximum utility through collaboration while minimizing the communication costs of collaboration. The cluster head selects different sets of execution nodes according to the information of cluster members and tasks in the method. Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (D-PSO) is designed and adopted to address the coalition formation in WSN. To overcome the weakness of D-PSO we proposed Dynamic Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DD-PSO) which introduces random perturbation and widens the global searching ability. Also coalition utility function is designed to guide the evolution. At last, the simulation shows that DD-PSO has better performance than other algorithms and achieves a balance between local solving and global searching, also it can effectively reduce the communication overhead and balance network load.																					978-1-4244-3709-2				2010																								WOS:000305114902227

First, in the distributed filtering network, each local filter simultaneously fuses the estimation and measurement from itself and neighboring nodes to achieve the system state estimation. And each sensor intelligent node is embedded with an event-triggered sampling mechanism, which can reduce the computation load or saving limited network bandwidth. Then, we use Bernoulli stochastic variables to describe whether the filtering network can successfully receive the system jump modes. Next, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, we design a distributed filter dependent on partial system modes, which has the exponential stability in mean square and H-infinity performance. Finally, all desired estimator parameters can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the distributed H-infinity filtering design approach.

Machine learning for graph-based representations of three-dimensional discrete fracture networks	COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES												Structural and topological information play a key role in modeling flow and transport through fractured rock in the subsurface. Discrete fracture network (DFN) computational suites such as dfnWorks (Hyman et al. Comput. Geosci. 84, 10-19 2015) are designed to simulate flow and transport in such porous media. Flow and transport calculations reveal that a small backbone of fractures exists, where most flow and transport occurs. Restricting the flowing fracture network to this backbone provides a significant reduction in the network's effective size. However, the particle-tracking simulations needed to determine this reduction are computationally intensive. Such methods may be impractical for large systems or for robust uncertainty quantification of fracture networks, where thousands of forward simulations are needed to bound system behavior. In this paper, we develop an alternative network reduction approach to characterizing transport in DFNs, by combining graph theoretical and machine learning methods. We consider a graph representation where nodes signify fractures and edges denote their intersections. Using random forest and support vector machines, we rapidly identify a subnetwork that captures the flow patterns of the full DFN, based primarily on node centrality features in the graph. Our supervised learning techniques train on particle-tracking backbone paths found by dfnWorks, but run in negligible time compared to those simulations. We find that our predictions can reduce the network to approximately 20% of its original size, while still generating breakthrough curves consistent with those of the original network.

In order to reflect the actual situation for the dynamic system, the constant time-delay is considered. In addition, the measurement output is first quantized by a uniform quantizer and then transmitted through a communication channel. The main purpose is to design a time-varying finite-horizon state estimator such that, for both the uniform quantization and time-delay, some sufficient criteria are obtained for the estimation error (EE) system to satisfy the error variance boundedness and the H-infinity performance constraint. With the help of stochastic analysis technique, a new H-infinity SE algorithm without resorting the augmentation method is proposed for DTVUNNs with uniform quantization. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed variance-constrained robust H-infinity SE method.																				2473-6988					2022	7	8					14227	14248		10.3934/math.2022784	http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/math.2022784													WOS:000806850800004

This design approach along with strong design assumptions limits application of protocols in universal scenarios and affects their practicality. With proliferation of embedded mobile sensors in consumer devices, a changed application paradigm requires generic protocols capable of managing greater device heterogeneousness and mobility.

The protocol being generic is equally applicable to heterogeneous, homogenous, static, and mobile sensor networks. It can handle event driven as well as continuous traffic flow applications.

J	Chang, KH; Chen, TL; Yang, FH; Chang, TY				Chang, Kuo-Hao; Chen, Tzu-Li; Yang, Fu-Hao; Chang, Tzu-Yin			Simulation optimization for stochastic casualty collection point location and resource allocation problem in a mass casualty incident	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												After a severe disaster strikes, a large number of casualties in need of urgent treatment, known as a mass casualty incident (MCI) event, arise from multiple disaster areas in a very short period of time and overwhelm available resources of the local healthcare system. This paper focuses on the effective design of casualty collection point (CCP) locations and the efficient allocation of limited emergency medical service (EMS) resources to transport casualties quickly to appropriate hospitals and increase the survival rate of casualties. A hybrid simulation-optimization approach to optimize the CCP location and EMS resource allocation problem over mixed binary and integer feasible domains for the minimization of expected complete delivery time of all casualties from disaster region to hospitals is presented in this work due to the stochastic and dynamic nature of the MCI logistics environment. A high-resolution stochastic discrete event simulation model considering time-varying stochastic casualty arrivals, random triage service times, and stochastic travel times caused by road network vulnerability is first constructed to describe a more detailed modeling of comprehensive MCI humanitarian logistics from the disaster regions to the hospitals. Then, a novel two-stage sequential algorithm, namely a combination of optimal computing budget allocation-based rapid-screening algorithm and adaptive particle global and hyperbox local search (ORSA-APGHLS), is developed to speed up convergence to near-optimal solutions compared to three common existing algorithms (Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search and Stochastic Nelder-Mead Algorithm) under a limited simulation budget.

BAYESIAN NETWORK STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION FOR IMPROVED DESIGN SPACE MAPPING FOR DESIGN EXPLORATION WITH MATERIALS DESIGN APPLICATIONS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2017, VOL 2B	Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences				ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences / Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE 2017)	AUG 06-09, 2017	Cleveland, OH	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div				Modern design problems present both opportunities and challenges, including multifunctionality, high dimensionality, highly nonlinear multimodal responses, and multiple levels or scales. These factors are particularly important in materials design problems and make it difficult for traditional optimization algorithms to search the space effectively, and designer intuition is often insufficient in problems of this complexity. Efficient machine learning algorithms can map complex design spaces to help designers quickly identify promising regions of the design space. In particular, Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) have been demonstrated as effective tools for top-down design of complex multilevel problems. The most common instantiations of BNCs assume that all design variables are independent. This assumption reduces computational cost, but can limit accuracy especially in engineering problems with interacting factors. The ability to learn representative network structures from data could provide accurate maps of the design space with limited computational expense. Population-based stochastic optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms (GAs) are ideal for optimizing networks because they accommodate discrete, combinatorial, and multimodal problems. Our approach utilizes GAs to identify optimal networks based on limited training sets so that future test points can be classified as accurately and efficiently as possible. This method is first tested on a common machine learning data set, and then demonstrated on a sample design problem of a composite material subjected to a planar sound wave.

Supply chain dynamics, such as demand fluctuation, and transportation instability, are omitted in most mathematical models due to tractability. We present a simulation-based optimization method in this paper for multi-criteria production-distribution network design. The method consists of a multiobjective optimizer and a simulation module. The optimizer, based on a multiobjective genetic algorithm, is used to direct the search for compromised solutions regarding to various criteria. Candidate solutions are evaluated by the discrete-event simulation module, dei,eloped in a flexible manner that enables automatic simulation of various supply chain structures without human intervention. The method is applied to a case study from automotive industry. A set of Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained, including decisions on the open/close decisions on facilities, order splitting ratios and inventory control policies.																			1062-922X		0-7803-8566-7				2004							4521	4526																WOS:000226863300762
J	Mukhopadhyay, A; Ruffini, M				Mukhopadhyay, Atri; Ruffini, Marco			Design Methodology for Wireless Backhaul/Fronthaul Using Free Space Optics and Fibers	JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY												The recent increase in data rates for Free space optics (FSO) transmission technology, means they could be used for designing the backhaul/fronthaul for 5G and beyond cellular networks. The flexibility and cost-effectiveness provided by FSO are the primary reasons for the mobile operators to investigate the potential of the technology as a mobile backhaul/fronthaul. Unfortunately, the reliability of FSO links is weather dependent, especially if the link covers considerable distance. Optical fibers, on the other hand, are expensive but more reliable. Hence, optimally designing a hybrid network consisting of both fiber and FSO connections can bring in the cost-effectiveness of FSO as well as the robustness of fibers. In such a design, the more important links are connected using fibers while the links with higher tolerance towards failure are designed using FSO. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid FSO/fiber backhaul/fronthauling methodology for connecting wireless base stations (BSs) to the network core. We first formulate a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) for determining the number of splitter/FSO distribution points required in the network that optimally provide connectivity to the BSs. The MINLP is designed to identify the locations of the splitters/FSO distribution points as well. Thereafter, we solve the MINLP with the help of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. We also derive a heuristic for solving the MILP. Finally, we propose another method for determining the number of splitters required in a relatively shorter time: K-means cluster based method. The results verify that the hybrid network is cost-effective while conforming to the data rate and reliability requirements of the links. The proposal allows evaluation of a seamless design solution of the hybrid network with practical time-complexity.

However, the severe tool wear in its machining is an evitable problem because it deteriorates product quality and productivity at the same time. Timely replacement of the tool should be taken in advance to reduce the influences of this drawback. In sum, the accurate estimation of the tool wear plays a crucial role in CFRP machining. Therefore, in this study, a tool wear estimation in CFRP drilling is presented. The method used is based on discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) of the thrust force signal and an artificial neural network (ANN). Two valuable features related to tool wear are identified and then extracted using DWT. The tool wear is estimated by using an ANN with two features adapted from DWT. Consequently, the tool wear, especially flank wear, in CFRP drilling can be accurately estimated using the proposed method.

We determine criteria for the coupling function that ensure the existence and stability of a large variety of clustered configurations.

We demonstrate that using simple trigonometric and localized coupling functions one can realize arbitrary patterns of stable clusters and that the designed systems are capable of performing finite state computation.

There are many ways in which drones can be used, including transportation, photography, climate monitoring, and disaster relief. The reason for this is their high level of efficiency and safety in all operations. While the design of drones strives for perfection, it is not yet flawless. When it comes to detecting and preventing collisions, drones still face many challenges. In this context, this paper describes a methodology for developing a drone system that operates autonomously without the need for human intervention. This study applies reinforcement learning algorithms to train a drone to avoid obstacles autonomously in discrete and continuous action spaces based solely on image data. The novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive assessment of the advantages, limitations, and future research directions of obstacle detection and avoidance for drones, using different reinforcement learning techniques. This study compares three different reinforcement learning strategies-namely, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-that can assist in avoiding obstacles, both stationary and moving; however, these strategies have been more successful in drones. The experiment has been carried out in a virtual environment made available by AirSim. Using Unreal Engine 4, the various training and testing scenarios were created for understanding and analyzing the behavior of RL algorithms for drones. According to the training results, SAC outperformed the other two algorithms. PPO was the least successful among the algorithms, indicating that on-policy algorithms are ineffective in extensive 3D environments with dynamic actors. DQN and SAC, two off-policy algorithms, produced encouraging outcomes. However, due to its constrained discrete action space, DQN may not be as advantageous as SAC in narrow pathways and twists. Concerning further findings, when it comes to autonomous drones, off-policy algorithms, such as DQN and SAC, perform more effectively than on-policy algorithms, such as PPO. The findings could have practical implications for the development of safer and more efficient drones in the future.					, m.senthilkumar/L-5551-2015; Quadir, Abdul/AAC-5596-2021; Basheer, Shakila/AAA-1155-2020; Sakri, Sapiah/R-3478-2016; J, Christy/N-2522-2016	, m.senthilkumar/0000-0002-8114-3147; Quadir, Abdul/0000-0002-0569-9960; Basheer, Shakila/0000-0001-9032-9560; Sakri, Sapiah/0000-0001-5034-2752; J, Christy/0000-0001-9468-7672														2504-446X				APR	2023	7	4							245	10.3390/drones7040245	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/drones7040245													WOS:000979371100001

To improve performance, we propose a Cross-scale Mixed-attention Network (CMNet) by designing multi-scale and mixed attention modules. We first concatenate the results of average and maximum pooling along each axis to learn powerful attention coefficients, which are used to weight the original input for producing a directional attention map along each axis. Then we use point-wise additions for combining three directional attention maps to propose a module of Fused 3D Attention (F3A). In addition, we adopt atrous convolutions to generate multi-scale feature maps, then point-wisely add the results of average and maximum pooling on each scale feature map, and design a bottleneck structure to produce an effective attention map for each scale and reduce learnable parameters simultaneously. All attention feature maps with different scales are concatenated to obtain Multi-scale Channel Attention (MCA). Finally, we cross-wisely stack the modules of F3A and MCA on both shallow and deep feature maps to propose Mixed Cross Enhancement (MCE) for fully fusing information across scales. Experiments show that our method surpasses most existing methods. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

There is a tradeoff between PE and IA under the constraint of available network resources. Transparency is needed to achieve PE in optical networks, as this requires the avoidance of the regeneration of an optical signal. This leads to an accumulation of noise due to the physical layer impairments and ultimately results in the loss of quality of the signal. We have optimized the selective usage of traffic grooming, mixed regeneratoion, and all optical wavelength conversion (AOWC) using integer linear programming to increase the PE and IA simultaneously. The optimized solution together with heuristics results are given for 24 node USNet and 19 node RailTel network of India. The utilization of heuristics for the longest path of RailTel network is shown in OptSim hardware simulation with comparative performance using various techniques. An experimental demonstration of an AOWC using semiconductor optical amplifier-based four wave mixing has been given in Section VII. A feature of this setup is that the wavelength converter subsystem remains in a lower power mode, until it is actuated by the control program based on the quality factor (Q-factor) of the signal.

More and more environment laws and regulations claim manufacturers be responsible for the whole lifecycle of their products, especially collection and disposal of used products. So it is very important to design a closed-loop supply chain network (CLSCN) by integrating forward supply chain network and reverse supply chain network. The optimization design of CLSCN is a strategy-level decision, which influences the efficiency and benefit of supply chain management. Aiming to design an appropriate CLSCN, this paper considers the uncertainty of the market demands and the recoverable quantities of used products, as well as the effects of direct sale. mode in electronic commerce and real time value of money on network design. A static, multi-products, multi-periods, restricted-capacity, mixed integrated nonlinear program model is introduced to determine the number and locations of various facilities and the optimal goods flows between them within the CLSCN. Finally, a numerical example tests the validity of the model.																					978-7-111-05005-6				2007							454	459																WOS:000253429300091

The MEPDG performance predictions for the anticipated climatic and traffic conditions depends on the values of the input parameters that characterize the pavement materials, layers, design features, and condition. This paper focuses on comprehensive global sensitivity analyses of flexible pavement performance predictions to MEPDG design inputs under five climatic conditions and three traffic levels. Design inputs evaluated in the analyses include traffic volume, layer thicknesses, material properties, and groundwater depth. Correlations between design inputs were considered as appropriate. The global sensitivity analysis varied all inputs simultaneously across the problem domain for each of the 15 base cases (five climates and three traffic levels). Two response surface modeling approaches-multivariate linear regressions and artificial neural networks-were developed for modeling the analysis results for evaluation of MEPDG input sensitivities across the problem domain. The response surface modeling approaches based on artificial neural networks were particularly effective in providing robust and accurate representations of the complex relationships between MEPDG inputs and distress outputs. The design limit normalized sensitivity index adopted in the study provided a practical interpretation of sensitivity by relating a given percentage change in an MEPDG input to the corresponding percentage change in predicted distress relative to its design limit value. The design inputs most consistently in the highest sensitivity categories across all distresses were the hot-mix asphalt dynamic modulus master curve, hot-mix asphalt thickness, surface shortwave absorptivity, and Poisson's ratio of hot-mix asphalt. Longitudinal and alligator fatigue cracking were also very sensitive to granular base thickness and resilient modulus and subgrade resilient modulus.

Initial Approach to Performance (Balanced) Mix Design: The Virginia Experience	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												Performance mix design (PMD) of asphalt mixtures, often referred to as balanced mix design, is a design methodology that incorporates performance testing into the mix design process. The Virginia Department of Transportation (DOT), like many owner agencies, is interested in ways to specify asphalt mix designs better in an effort to make its roadway network more sustainable, longer lasting, and more economical. By adding performance criteria through a PMD framework, that goal can be achieved. Further, a PMD framework should allow for the development of new, innovative methods to increase pavement recyclability, new performance additives, and other means to enhance pavement performance. This paper provides details and documentation of the approach being taken by the Virginia DOT in their efforts to develop a PMD specification. Aspects of development presented include PMD method options, selection of performance tests, and determination of acceptance criteria. A discussion about validating specifications with in-service performance data and addressing quality control and quality assurance is also provided. Although additional work is needed for full development and implementation, the methodology being applied has been found to provide useful outcomes for the Virginia DOT even in the initial stages of development.																			0361-1981	2169-4052				FEB	2019	2673	2					335	345		10.1177/0361198118823732	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0361198118823732													WOS:000468889100031

A non-augmented fitter is designed for each node to guarantee an optimized upper bound on the state estimation error covariance matrix despite nodes coupling as well as the linearization errors. Compared with the existing augmented filter, the cross-covariance matrices between coupling nodes are not required to be computed and the gain matrix can be obtained separately for each node by solving two Riccati-like difference equations.

Applications of size (n > 30) cannot be solved optimally by an exact algorithm in reasonable time, and the evolutionary algorithms have drawn the attention of NoC researchers. In this paper, we propose a new effective optimization method based on the discrete particle swarm optimization framework, which includes the novel principles for representation, velocity computing, and position-updating of the particles. In our proposed method, particles are allowed to swing between elite and regular pools, and a simple local search procedure is applied on elite particles to exploit the promising solutions. Extensive computational studies using standard benchmark instances and task graphs for free (TGFF) random instances reveal that the proposed optimization algorithm is able to attain the best results, and thus competes very favorably with the previously proposed heuristic approaches. A stability analysis and the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests are also presented to shed light on the robust behavior of the algorithm.

C	Zachariasz, A			IOP	Zachariasz, Agata			Development of The System of the Green Areas of Krakow from The Nineteenth Century to The Present, In The Context of Model Solutions	3RD WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY CIVIL ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE, URBAN PLANNING SYMPOSIUM (WMCAUS 2018)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				3rd World Multidisciplinary Civil Engineering, Architecture, Urban Planning Symposium (WMCAUS)	JUN 18-22, 2018	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					The shaping of green areas with varying degrees of arrangement and different forms of use, as well as of their structure in the form of a system within cities, are tasks that are aimed at, among other goals, the protection of the environment and nature, the integration of urban structure and the improvement of the quality of life. In modern cities, which develop in a multi-central manner, it is often impossible to develop model systems of green areas featured in literature, such as the belt, wedge, radiant or ring type. Currently these are most often mixed systems, to which terms like open, irregular and distributed are most often referred to. What is important is the continuous layout of areas of greenery, an appropriate access range and a hierarchical structure of use, ranging from the housing estate parks, that are the closest to our homes, to regional parks. The article discusses the example of Krakow - a historical city, the second-largest in Poland. Krakow occupies a prominent position among cities that are both beautiful and picturesque, which have outstanding spatial qualities and a genius loci. The placement of the city in the Vistula River Valley, a diverse topographic layout, in addition to varied land cover all constitute its unique natural and landscape values. Conceptual designs and the implementation of plans of the shaping of areas of the greenery of Krakow have been compared with model solutions. The contemporary spatial structure of Krakow's areas of greenery has been shaped by natural conditions and the development of its urban structure. A particular role in this process has been played by: the campaign to embellish Krakow, when many streets were given the character of avenues, the founding of urban plantations in the place of former fortifications and the Trzech Wieszczy Avenues upon the embankment of the circumvallation rail and the the Planty Dietla park in place of the river bed of the Old Vistula. A key role was also played by the successive spatial development plans, starting in 1910, as well as concepts of the development of greenery and municipal policies. The most well-known model scheme of a wedge and ring system of areas of Greenery for Krakow was developed by A. Ptaszycka and J. Bogdanowski (the 1950's). It was based on the hydrographic system and the rocade roads of the Krakow Fortress. This concept, ideal in its expression, was not transferred onto spatial development plans, with the following factors being responsible: the territorial expansion of the city, its contemporary multi-centrality and changing geometric shape. In 1996, a greenery system was developed featuring so-called river parks, based on the hydrographic system (wedge model). A conceptual design was developed in 2017, showing the contemporary network of green areas in Krakow with the greatest level of detail. An integrating model was proposed - a mixed network model with legible wedges in the form of river parks and compact afforestation. The author participated in the development of the last two concepts.

Deep learning has been very successful in nonlinear modeling, but there has been little work done in the functional data setting. We propose two variations of our framework: a functional neural network with continuous hidden layers, called the Functional Direct Neural Network (FDNN), and a second version that uses basis expansions and continuous hidden layers, called the Functional Basis Neural Network (FBNN). Both are designed explicitly to exploit the structure inherent in functional data. To fit these models we derive a functional gradient based optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed methods in handling complex functional models is demonstrated by comprehensive simulation studies and real data examples. for this article are available online.

The system under consideration includes various network-induced uncertainties, e.g., sensor saturation, quantization error, communication delay, and packet dropouts. Specifically, all these uncertainties are assumed to occur in a stochastic way. In addition, the measurement scheduling issue is also addressed such that only a portion of measurements are broadcasting due to the communication constraints. The main focus is on the design of distributed filters based on the information received locally and from the neighborhood such that the desired estimation performance is guaranteed in terms of the decay rate and disturbance attenuation level. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the existence condition for such filters is first proposed and the filter gain parameters are then determined by solving an optimization problem. A simulation example is finally presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the new filtering techniques.

J	Chao, W; Tsun, W				Chao, W; Tsun, W			Event-driven network topology monitoring function	IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL												This paper discusses the design of a topology management application. The application monitors the topology of point-to-point networks in which each network node is required to contain only local trunk information. To build and continuously update the topology map, information must be collected from network nodes. The challenge is to do this in real time without adversely consuming network bandwidth. By defining a clear set of conditions to determine whether polling or event monitoring should be used, this design makes it possible to realize the advantage of monitoring network topology by processing events. With the use of event monitoring, first, consumption of network bandwidth by network management traffic can be significantly reduced compared to a pure polling approach, and second, the topology map represents a continuous topology history.																			0018-8670						1996	35	1					25	36		10.1147/sj.351.0025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1147/sj.351.0025													WOS:A1996TY41700003

Chimera States in Neuro-Inspired Area-Efficient Asynchronous Cellular Automata Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS												Synchronization transition in neuromorphic networks has attracted much attention recently as a fundamental property of biological neural networks, which relies on network connectivity along with different synaptic features. In this work, an area-optimized FPGA implementation of an Asynchronous Cellular Automata Neuron model that exhibits discrete-state neuron dynamics is introduced. The proposed neuron model is capable of reproducing various neuromorphic oscillations observed in biological neurons using less hardware resources than previous implementations. We investigate synchronization transitions with a focus on the emergence of chimera states in a ring-based network consisting of hardware-based neurons with electrical synaptic coupling. In particular, we study the effects on the network's phase synchronization through changing two control parameters: the coupling range and the coupling strength. We indicate that via proper configuration of the coupling parameters, we influence the synchronization transition and reveal chimera states which have been associated with neurological disorders.

Further, the model aims to find the optimal structure of the network in order to satisfy market demand with the minimum overall capital and operational cost. Applicability and robustness of the proposed model are illustrated by using a medium real case study from a European consumer goods company whereas its benefits are valued through a comparison with a counterpart model that utilizes the mainstream fixed echelon network structure.

Decentralized observer-based control via networked communication	AUTOMATICA												This paper provides one of the first approaches to the design of decentralized observer-based output-feedback controllers for linear plants where the controllers, sensors and actuators are connected via a shared communication network subject to time-varying transmission intervals and delays. Due to the communication medium being shared, it is impossible to transmit all control commands and measurement data simultaneously. As a consequence, a protocol is needed to orchestrate what data is sent over the network at each transmission instant. To effectively deal with the shared communication medium using observer-based controllers, we adopt a switched observer structure that switches based on the available measured outputs and a switched controller structure that switches based on available control inputs at each transmission time. By taking a discrete-time switched linear system perspective, we are able to derive a general model that captures all these networked and decentralized control aspects. The proposed synthesis method is based on decomposing the closed-loop model into a multi-gain switched static output-feedback form. This decomposition allows for the formulation of linear matrix inequality based synthesis conditions which, if satisfied, provide stabilizing observer-based controllers, which are both decentralized and robust to network effects. A numerical example illustrates the strengths as well as the limitations of the developed theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A parameterized tracking error model of the HFV is derived with some considered uncertainties, which are approximated by an IT2FNN. The tracking control of the velocity and altitude of the HFV is designed by using a prescribed performance control technique. It allows that transient characteristics of the tracking errors can be improved and adjusted by some prescribed performance functions. According to an adaptive backstepping control design procedure, novel continuous control laws of the fuel equivalency ratio, canard deflection, and elevator deflection are designed with logarithmic quantization mechanism, for the sake of avoiding inadvertently increasing the effective gains of continuous controllers as well as reducing loads of the communication from controller unit to actuator unit. Besides, the limited tracking errors of the flight path angle and angle-of-attack can be achieved by applying the designed controllers. Finally, the presented tracking controllers with quantization mechanism are validated by comparative simulations.

J	Zhu, YS				Zhu, Yushan			Mixed-integer linear programming algorithm for a computational protein design problem	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												The computational protein design problem or the side-chain positioning problem is a central part in computational methods for predicting protein structure and designing protein sequences. However, the computational protein design problem is NP-complete, and it is also NP-complete to find a reasonable approximate solution to this problem. Here, we present a critical finding that the network flow structure embedded in the integer linear programming formulation of the computational protein design problem makes it equivalent to a mixed-integer linear programming formulation with fewer binary variables. This novel formulation effectively reduces the combinatorial difficulty of the computational protein design problem, thereby allowing the sequence selection of the global minimum energy conformation for large proteins to become tractable by using the standard optimization algorithms. Our preliminary calculation results for 20 core redesigned proteins show that the mixed-integer linear programming algorithm with a validated physical model is faster than its integer linear programming counterpart by up to 3 times. More importantly, the specific mathematical structure underlying the mixed-integer linear programming formulation paves the way for developing even faster combinatorial searching strategies by using stronger cutting planes for mixed-integer programming.																			0888-5885					JAN 31	2007	46	3					839	845		10.1021/ie0605985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie0605985													WOS:000243682900020

In general, a deformation monitoring network can be designed using the trial and error method or analytical methods such as linear programming and nonlinear programming. Recently, a deformation monitoring network may also be designed by heuristic optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Simulated Annealing (SA).

J	Chu, YC				Chu, YC			Bounds of the incremental gain for discrete-time recurrent neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS												As a nonlinear system, a recurrent neural network generally has an incremental gain different from its induced norm. While most of the previous, research efforts were focused on the latter, this paper presents a method to compute an effective upper bound of the former for a class of discrete-time recurrent neural networks, which is not only applied to systems with arbitrary inputs but also extended to systems with small-norm inputs. The upper bound is computed by simple optimizations subject to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). To demonstrate the wide connections of our results to problems in control, the servomechanism is then studied, where a feedforward neural network is designed to control the output of a recurrent neural network to track a set of trajectories. This problem can be converted into the synthesis of feedforward-feedback gains such that the incremental gain of a certain system is minimized. An algorithm to perform such a synthesis is proposed and illustrated with a numerical example.																			1045-9227					SEP	2002	13	5					1087	1098	PII S1045-9227(02)04438-7	10.1109/TNN.2002.1031941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2002.1031941								18244506					WOS:000177992800007
J	Hung, SW; Kim, JK				Hung, Szu Wen; Kim, Jin-Kuk			Integrated water networks optimisation under uncertainty	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												An automated design method for the water networks under uncertain process conditions has been developed. To deal with the uncertainty problem, the installation of buffer tank and the installation of supplementing pipelines are systematically considered in the design of water networks. The cost-effective and feasible distribution and reuse of water within the network is identified from the superstructure-based optimisation model, with which all the operational constraints and fluctuating operating characteristics for water-using operations are fully and simultaneously reflected. The optimisation framework provides rigorous economic evaluation of the network through trade-off between operating and capital costs under uncertainty. The conceptual insight related to the design of water networks is incorporated in developing a reliable solution strategy which can effectively deal with the difficulty in solving the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Case studies are given to validate the proposed model and demonstrate the importance of considering uncertain process conditions in the design and optimisation of water networks.

In this paper, we consider a co-design approach to apply these two methods jointly to improve the interaction between different methods and to get a better overall performance. We aim at finding the optimal network topology and the optimal parameters of traffic control laws at the same time by solving a co-optimization problem. However, such an optimization problem is usually highly non-linear and non-convex, and it possibly involves a mixed-integer form. Therefore, we discuss four different solution frameworks that can be used for solving the co-optimization problem, according to different requirements on the computational complexity and speed.

J	Zhang, Y; Wang, SX				Zhang, Yu; Wang, Shixing			MLP technique based reinforcement learning control of discrete pure-feedback systems	NEUROCOMPUTING												The reinforcement learning control with neural networks (NNs) is investigated for a class of pure-feedback systems in discrete time using minimal-learning-parameter (MLP) technique. To make the dynamics feasible for controller design, the nth order system is transformed into the prediction model. By selecting the "strategic" utility function including the future performance, the critic NN is designed. The action NN is employed to minimize both the strategic utility function and the tracking error. A radial basis function (RBF) NN is employed to approximate the unknown control with the MLP technique which greatly reduces the number of the online adaptive parameters. The uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop tracking error is guaranteed. The feasibility of the proposed controller is verified by a simulation example. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For an unknown discrete-time nonlinear system, in this paper, a semi-parametric model is used to describe this discrete-time nonlinear system, and this semi-parametric model contains a parametric uncertainty part and a nonparametric uncertainty part. Based on this semi-parametric model, a novel data-driven control algorithm based on an information concentration estimator and regularized online sequential extreme learning machine (ReOS-ELM) is designed. The information concentration estimator estimates the parametric uncertainty part; The training data of ReOS-ELM network is obtained, based on symmetry and information concentration estimator, then the training of ReOS-ELM network and the estimate of nonparametric uncertainty part using ReOS-ELM network are carried out online, successively. A stability analysis and three simulation examples were performed, and the simulation results show that the proposed data-driven control algorithm is effective in improving the control accuracy.																				2073-8994				JAN	2024	16	1							88	10.3390/sym16010088	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym16010088													WOS:001151482900001

Each agent is equipped with the same sensing, computing, and motion-control capabilities to achieve rendezvous based on the neighbors' states. First, a convex hull combination algorithm (CHCA) is designed, in which each agent solves a convex problem composed of perceived neighbors in the sensing region and chooses an optimal control strategy to move to the next position with guaranteed connectivity under low-density network topologies. Second, the relative neighborhood graph is incorporated into the CHCA (RNCHCA) as the constraint set to adapt to the high-density network topologies. The convergence and connectivity of the proposed algorithms are proved based on the geometric concept and case analyses. Finally, a large number of simulation results show that under the initially connected topologies with different densities, the RNCHCA can achieve a higher rendezvous speed than that achieved by the traditional circumcenter algorithm, particularly under high-density network topologies.

By employing a stochastic Kronecker delta function, the phenomena of the incomplete measurements are characterized which contain the signal quantization and missing measurements in a unified framework. We design a new recursive filter such that, for both stochastic uncertainties and incomplete measurements, we obtain an upper bound of the filtering error covariance and then minimize such an upper bound by properly designing the filter gains. It is shown that the desired filter gain can be obtained in terms of the solutions to two Riccati-like difference equations, and therefore the proposed filtering algorithm is recursive suitable for online computations. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the developed filtering scheme.

J	Kwon, HW				Kwon, Hyang Won			A Social Embeddedness Perspective on Turnover Intention: The Role of Informal Networks and Social Identity Evidence From South Korea	PUBLIC PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT												This study examines turnover intention through a social embeddedness perspective proposing that turnover intention may be a function of the degree to which an organization's members are attached to one another in terms of relational ties and emotional bonds. Drawing on network theory and social identity theory, it was hypothesized that peripheral positions in informal networks (solidarity ties and instrumental ties) and marginal identity in the workplace may influence higher turnover intention. Sequential mixed methods design was utilized to explore the context-specific bases upon which informal networks and social identities can form and to test the generality of the link between the explored bases and turnover intention against larger samples using Ordered Logistic Model. The results showed that (a) peripherally positioned individuals in informal networks will likely have high turnover intention and (b) individuals with marginal identity in the workplace will likely have high turnover intention. The study results suggest that the social factors accrued from informal networks and social identities deserve enhanced attention in both theorization and personnel management.																			0091-0260	1945-7421				SEP	2017	46	3					263	287		10.1177/0091026017717459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0091026017717459													WOS:000407517500003

J	Wang, Y				Wang, Yan			Resilience Quantification for Probabilistic Design of Cyber-Physical System Networks	ASCE-ASME JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS PART B-MECHANICAL ENGINEERING												Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are the physical systems of which individual components have functional identities in both physical and cyber spaces. Given the vastly diversified CPS components in dynamically evolving networks, designing an open and resilient architecture with flexibility and adaptability thus is important. To enable a resilience engineering approach for systems design, quantitative measures of resilience have been proposed by researchers. Yet, domain-dependent system performance metrics are required to quantify resilience. In this paper, generic system performance metrics for CPS are proposed, which are entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information associated with the probabilities of successful prediction and communication. A new probabilistic design framework for CPS network architecture is also proposed for resilience engineering, where several information fusion rules can be applied for data processing at the nodes. Sensitivities of metrics with respect to the probabilistic measurements are studied. Fine-grained discrete-event simulation models of communication networks are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed metrics.

We propose a unified framework for cooperative delivery, which aims to minimize the total latency in the network. With fairness among users and physicallayer transmission, beamformers and content assignment are jointly optimized to fully exploit the benefits of caching. To address the resulting mixed binary nonconvex problem, a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is derived with low complexity.

J	Wan, XB; Fang, HJ; Fu, S				Wan, Xiongbo; Fang, Huajing; Fu, Sheng			Observer-based fault detection for networked discrete-time infinite-distributed delay systems with packet dropouts	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING												This paper addresses the problem of fault detection for networked discrete-time infinite-distributed delay systems with packet dropouts. Both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator packet dropouts are described by two different Bernoulli distributed white sequences, respectively. The problem addressed is to design an observer-based fault detection filter (FDF) such that the error between the residual and the fault is made as small as possible. Unlike most of the existing literature, we have noted that the control input of the observer is different from that of the plant because of packet dropouts in the controller-to-actuator link. Sufficient condition for the existence of the FDF is derived in terms of some linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When these LMIs are feasible, the explicit expression of the desired FDF can also be characterized. A numerical example is exploited to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.

J	Taeihagh, A				Taeihagh, Araz			Network-centric policy design	POLICY SCIENCES												Two important challenges in policy design are better understanding of the design space and consideration of the temporal factors. Moreover, in recent years it has been demonstrated that understanding the complex interactions of policy measures can play an important role in policy design and analysis. In this paper, the advances made in conceptualization and application of networks to policy design in the past decade are highlighted. Specifically, the use of a network-centric policy design approach in better understanding the design space and temporal consequences of design choices are presented. Network-centric policy design approach has been used in classification, visualization, and analysis of the relations among policy measures as well as ranking of policy measures using their internal properties and interactions, and conducting sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, through use of a decision support system, network-centric approach facilitates ranking, visualization, and selection of policies using different sets of criteria, and exploring the potential for compromise in policy formulation. The advantage of the network-centric approach is providing the ability to go beyond visualizations and analysis of policies and piecemeal use of network concepts as a tool for different policy design tasks to moving to a more integrated bottom-up approach to design. Furthermore, the computational advantages of the network-centric policy design in considering temporal factors such as policy sequencing and addressing issues such as layering, drift, policy failure, and delay are presented. Finally, some of the current challenges of network-centric design are discussed, and some potential avenues of exploration in policy design through use of computational methodologies, as well as possible integration with approaches from other disciplines, are highlighted.

J	Tang, XM; Xing, J; Han, SC				Tang Xin-min; Xing Jian; Han Song-chen			Runway incursion prevention method based on a discrete object sensing event-driven model	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS												A runway incursion prevention system for high density airports based on an event-driven sensor network is presented, in which non-cooperative active detection sensors, such as microwave or infrared sensors installed beside the critical points of runways and taxiways other than SMR, ADS-B, or MLAT to detect and locate aircraft or vehicle continuously, and the discrete airdrome surface traffic situation can be reconstructed based on the fusion of object sensing events detected by a sensor network and the landing and taking off events reported by pilots. Thus, an airdrome surface operation model based on Petri Nets is proposed based on runway operation rules in the present study. After defining the runway prevention control regulations, runway incursion detection and prevention was transformed into a state forbidden problem. A logical controller that satisfied a strong regulatory condition design method was developed for uncontrollable events in the airdrome surface operation model. The logical controller we proposed is centralised and maximally permissive, and the runway incursion prevention control actions, such as airfield lighting system, can be adopted to execute the discrete control policies generated by logical controller automatically. The illustrated case demonstrated that a controller designed with stop-bar lights or center-line guidance lights could prevent runway incursions in an efficient manner, while its time complexity depended only on the sensor network configurations rather than the number of objects, which is more suitable for high density airports. In general, the combination of active event-driven sensor and discrete event controller is a RIPS solution.						han, songchen/0000-0001-8598-6558													1751-956X	1751-9578				SEP	2014	8	6					558	569		10.1049/iet-its.2013.0128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-its.2013.0128													WOS:000344317400007

Event-triggered guaranteed cost control for uncertain discrete-time networked control systems with time-varying transmission delays	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												In this study, event-triggered guaranteed cost control problem for discrete-time networked control systems (NCSs) with parameter uncertainties and time-varying transmission delays is studied. First, an event-triggering scheme for discrete-time NCSs is proposed. Then by using a delay system approach, a unified model of event-triggered control systems with parameter uncertainties and state delay is established. By applying Laypunov functional method together with linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, sufficient conditions for the existence of an admissible guaranteed cost controller are established, which ensure a specific quadratic cost function has an upper bound for all admissible uncertainties. The proposed stability and stabilisation conditions are formulated in the framework of LMIs, which can be solved efficiently by using existing optimisation techniques. Finally, a numerical example and a practical example are given to demonstrate that, under the proposed event-triggering scheme, the advantage of reducing communication traffic in a control network without compromising the stability of the closed-loop system is preserved.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				DEC	2012	6	18					2793	2804		10.1049/iet-cta.2012.0036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2012.0036													WOS:000314503400008
J	Prenkert, F				Prenkert, Frans			Understanding business networks from a mixed network and system ontology position A review of the research field	IMP JOURNAL												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the ontological implications of combining network and system ontology to conceptualize industrial networks as the empirical manifestations of complex adaptive economic systems. Design/methodology/approach - This paper contributes with a systematic discussion on how network and system ontology can be combined to produce better understandings of business networks. It also provides a review of the state-of-the art research literature on the topic as a starting point for the discussion. Findings - Findings indicate that networks may be enclosed in each other constituting sub-and supra-networks comprising increasing complexity. In these cases, sub-networks that are black-boxed can be seen as entities in themselves producing inputs and outputs to the supra-network. Networks, once they become black-boxed, can assume the functions of generative mechanisms within a wider supra-network. Research limitations/implications - This research is conceptual in nature and needs to be complemented with empirical research. In addition, the literature review used one database complemented with papers from the IMP journal. A wider search could reveal additional research that can be of relevance for the development of the field. Originality/value - This paper addresses the ontological and methodological issues arising from a mixed system and network ontology. These issues are commonly ignored or dealt with indirectly in extant literature. For any accumulation of knowledge in the field to be possible, the explication of a mixed ontology is important as it have conceptual and methodological consequences. Adopting such a mixed ontological position provides an ontology in line with empirical research of business practice.

On the other hand, the computation time is crucial importance for solving the CNDP because the algorithms implemented on real sized networks require solving traffic assignment model many times, which is the most time consuming part of the solution process. Although the methods developed so far are capable of solving the CNDP, an efficient algorithm, which is able to solve the CNDP with less number of User Equilibrium (UE) assignments, is still needed. Therefore, this paper deals with solving the CNDP using MOdified Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithm with a new local search and mutation operators. For this purpose, a bilevel model is proposed, in which the upper level problem deals with minimizing the sum of total travel time and investment cost of link capacity expansions, while at the lower level problem, UE link Bows are determined by Wardrop's first principle.

Motivated by the time-discrete nature of application data sampling, we redefine the problem to have guaranteed coverage, connectivity and delay within some known bounded time. We further explore a class of wakeup schemes based on the cyclic symmetric block design (CSBD) that offer bounded-time characteristics to better manage energy usage. We made simulation studies of our proposed scheme, and investigated the impact of such wakeup schemes on an application-layer data fusion algorithm.

A CAN has advantages over point-to-point communication; however, it imposes network-induced delays and network congestion into the control system, which can deteriorate the shifting quality and make system integration difficult. This paper presents a co-design scheme combining active period scheduling and discrete-time slip mode control (SMC) to deal with both network-induced delays and network congestion of the CAN, which improves the speed synchronization control for high shifting quality and prevents network congestion for the system's integration. The results of simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which can ensure satisfactory speed synchronization performance while significantly reducing the network's utilization.

Communication bandwidth of the network is the shared resource which is limited. For an efficient use of the limited resource, two important aspects should be taken into account: resource distribution and resource utilization. This paper describes an event based co-design methodology of control law, bandwidth scheduling and event generator for networked control systems. The event-triggered control system with communication uncertainness is modeled as a discrete-time switched system with parameter uncertainties. The joint design of robust control strategy and event generator to guarantee the globally uniformly asymptotic stability of close-loop system under an event based scheduler is formulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem which can be solved efficiently. The proposed approach is evaluated through a simulation for networked control of a set of inverted pendulums. The results of simulation show that the proposed event based co-design method obtains better control performance with lower resource utilization since the transmission of new measurements and update of control command perform only when it is necessary.																			2151-1403		978-1-4673-9073-6				2017							237	243																WOS:000403390300035

A potential strategy for mitigating sustainability issues entails the utilisation of discarded tyres through the process of recycling. Nevertheless, the establishment of a closed-loop supply chain that is both sustainable and profitable presents a noteworthy challenge. This study proposes a novel multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to design a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network in the tire industry. The objective of the model is to optimize the overall cost of the network, taking into account the environmental consequences related to the establishment of facilities, tire processing, and transportation. While metaheuristic algorithms have been extensively employed to solve network design problems, they are not very effective in handling large-scale networks. To overcome this limitation, our study introduces six new multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition (MOEA/D) variants. The present study introduces a prospective methodology for devising supply chain networks that are sustainable in nature, while simultaneously ensuring a harmonious equilibrium between economic and environmental considerations. The efficacy of the proposed multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model and its MOEA/D variants in addressing large-scale networks has been demonstrated through the obtained results. As such, this study contributes to sustainable supply chain management, which is becoming increasingly important in the current environment.

By establishing an impulsive delayed differential inequality, some novel and less conservative criteria for global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of such model are derived analytically. It is shown that under certain conditions, impulses can make the underlying continuous unstable delayed neural networks globally exponentially stable.

In fact, this mix of Radio Access Networks (RAN) become more heterogeneous as various technologies such as LTE, UMTS and WiMAX operates at the small cells. To fully utilise the capacity of such rich field of heterogeneous wireless connectivity, mobile devices should be able to select RAN (or a combination of RANs) for their connection and depending on their need. The proposed algorithm here is based on an autonomous agent at the mobile node, and assisted by integration of distributed cloud services. The ultimate aim is the design of RAN selection algorithm owned by autonomous and intelligent user agents that can significantly improve the user's Quality of Experience (QoE) in terms of network coverage, data rate, and battery life-time.

An optimisation algorithm is presented which generates the fixed wireless access network infrastructure design, and results are presented to illustrate the use of the model and its implementation. Economic measures based on the net present value (NPV) are defined to assess the financial viability of potential network designs. The NPV is used within the mathematical optimization framework to produce cost-effective deployments that maximize economic performance while maintaining technical constraints on the network. The model takes into account time-varying input parameters on CapEx, OpEx, revenues and subscriber requirements to model the dynamic nature of the market. Technical radio constraints taken into account include downlink area coverage, interference, capacity and availability. The model and optimisation framework are illustrated by considering the deployment and configuration of infrastructure for three scenarios representing urban, suburban and rural regions.

A design method of S-box is proposed based on dynamic iteration of the cascaded integer chaos, which is obtained by the cascade and integer quantization of one-dimensional discrete chaotic map logistic and tent. the S-box not only conform to the application requirements of node operation and computational efficiency, but also compensate the degradation of dynamic characteristics of the singlelevel integer chaos. The performance tests of S-box were carried out, including nonlinearity degree, differential uniformity, strict avalanche criterion, out-put bit independence criterion and bijective property. In contrast to the existing classical S-box based on chaotic map, the results indicate that the S-box has more excellent cryptographic properties, and it can be used as a candidate nonlinear component in the design of block cryptogram algorithm for wireless sensor network.																			2233-7857					DEC	2016	9	12					97	106		10.14257/ijfgcn.2016.9.12.09	http://dx.doi.org/10.14257/ijfgcn.2016.9.12.09													WOS:000396877300009

Deep hashing further improves the retrieval quality by combining the hash coding with deep neural network. However, a major difficulty in deep hashing lies in the discrete constraints imposed on the network output, which generally makes the optimization NP hard. In this work, we adopt the greedy principle to tackle this NP hard problem by iteratively updating the network toward the probable optimal discrete solution in each iteration. A hash coding layer is designed to implement our approach which strictly uses the sign function in forward propagation to maintain the discrete constraints, while in back propagation the gradients are transmitted intactly to the front layer to avoid the vanishing gradients. In addition to the theoretical derivation, we provide a new perspective to visualize and understand the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods in both supervised and unsupervised tasks.

Uncertainties, disturbances, and input saturation are explicitly taken into account. The proposed controller incorporates a smooth function by using a hyperbolic tangent function to substitute for the saturation nonlinearity in the system. Moreover, a novel backstepping-like slab thickness tracking controller is developed for a third-order cascade system within two steps. Taking advantages of radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) technique, a RBFNN-based reconstruction law is introduced to approximate the composite term consisting unknown function, disturbances, and saturation error. Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the designed control algorithm guarantees the asymptotic stability of the system with great robustness.

What has been missing is the combination of this research in a way that would provide a simple to use design tool for geopolymer concrete as a replacement to concrete based on Portland Cement. This research paper addresses this requirement for developing a standard mix design method for Class F, low calcium fly ash based geopolymer concrete using Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) model. Published geopolymer concrete research data was combined into a database and analysed to give the ratios of water/solid, alkaline activator/fly ash, Na2SiO3/NaOH, and NaOH molarity. Targeted compressive strengths ranging from 30 MPa to 55 MPa at 28 days were achieved with laboratory experiments, using the proposed MARS mix design methodology. Thus, this tool has the capability to provide a novel approach for the design of geopolymer concrete mixes to achieve the desired compressive strength appropriate for the construction requirement.

The objective of the design approach is: given a fixed budget, determine how to incrementally improve the network survivability in order to reduce the risk from network failures. Risk is defined as the product of the failure probability and the damage resulting from the failure. The design approach consists of two parts: a risk assessment and a risk reduction investment strategy. Fault tree models, which depict causal relationships among failure events in the network are used for the risk assessment The risk-reduction investment strategy is used to determine an allocation of budget for implementing a survivability technique (e.g., link protection) in different parts of the network to minimize the network risk. Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations and greedy-based heuristics are proposed for solving the minimum-risk design problems. Numerical results illustrating the investment strategy for link and path protections, using an MILP approach and proposed heuristic algorithms, along with the comparisons of different capital investment alternatives on the basis of risk consideration are presented and discussed.

The overall aim of the project is to address the shortcomings in higher education (HE) across Georgia and China by systematically engaging higher education institutions in new practices with a learner-centred focus. Specific objectives are aimed to build capacities in partner countries (PC) institutions for implementing learner-centred teaching, raise awareness about learner-centred teaching in PC institutions and society at large and create a basic for cooperation through international network for exchange of experiences. In the project 12 members from 6 countries are involved. The consortium includes 2 types of higher education institutions (HEIs): European HEIs with experience in teacher training and teachers' continuous professional development; and Georgian and Chinese HEIs that are both in need of and eager to receive training on these matters. Project activities are divided into the following phases: preparation, design, implementation, and testing. At the preparation stage, a manual for learner-centred teaching will be developed (WP1). The Manual Development team will identify methods that promote learner-centred teaching and best practices for Higher Education, taking into consideration the needs analysis conducted during the project proposal development process. The finalized manual will be piloted during training of trainers (WP2) and, after translated and published. At the design stage, development of a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) unit per PC partners is planned. Each CPD unit will be equipped with relevant infrastructure that serves learner-oriented approach implementation process. After the equipment is purchased, trainers will be trained to implement the learner-centred approach according to the manual. At the implementation stage, involved parties will develop a sustainability strategy and establish an online platform for continuous communication with beneficiaries and all other interested parties. Digital training materials will be distributed to all universities in China and Georgia (WP3). The testing stage involves the development of a project exploitation strategy and plan. It also ensures the sustainability of outcomes by holding workshops that promote the learner-centred approach. These are meant for a wider set of universities in China and Georgia. The workshops will work to incite interest in implementing learner-centred teaching from the teachers and university management (WP5). Quality monitoring strategy applied in the project processing (WP4) implies two-way control: it monitors the project procedures and the content itself. The project work involves a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods which would provide complementary perspectives on relevant issues. The quantitative research approach accounts for the generation of reliable, objective data that is suitable for examining the short and long-term variations of a situations, while the qualitative method provides an in-depth understanding of the reasons and motivations underlying the envisaged changes.

This research composes of two essential research domains, one is networked virtual environment (NVE) and the other is mobile computing. With the proposed technique, a user can use a mobile device to join a networked virtual environment and interact with desktop users of the same virtual environment. To achieve this goal, three technical issues have to be solved including mobile networking, resource-shortage and coordinates coordination. The paper presents solutions to all of these issues. Further, a Mobility Supporting Server (MSS) is proposed to implement presented solutions into an existing networked virtual environment, called 3D virtual campus, Taiwan.

The discourse centers on the role of social media and its utility in the teaching and learning environment. Several arguments have been made to support its use because they are highly collaborative, easily accessible, and provide opportunities to embed a variety of Web 2.0 tools such as blogs, wikis, and online chats. However, there is a dearth in research on teacher use of educational social networking sites (SNS) in Trinidad and Tobago. The purpose of this study was to explore how 35 secondary school teachers in Trinidad and Tobago participated in an educational online social networking site. This study utilized a mixed methods exploratory approach and allowed for the use of online data capture together with questionnaires and interviews. Combined data analysis revealed five different levels of site participation, with most teachers adopting the role of content consumer rather than of content producer. Barriers to participation were time, motivation, technology, and usability. The designed social networking site allowed teachers to make public their discourse on their practice while connecting with colleagues from other schools. The study was qualitative dominant, with the mixed methods research approach allowing for deeper exploration of teachers' participation on this social networking website, and was justified by the newness and transient nature of data from social networking websites.

The MMCX client/server architecture also provides access to the wide area network (WAN), allowing LAN end points to call users on other networks. The MMCX enables users to communicate and collaborate in a manner that best suits their needs by supporting multiparty conferencing with any type and combination of mixed media. MMCX calls can consist of any mix of voice, data, image, and video media types, with at least one of the calling/called parties directly connected to a packet transmission and/or switched network. A party to the call may be using one or more communications media, but it is not necessary for all parties on a multiparty conference call to be using the same media mix. For example, three parties may be communicating visually using LAN-connected desktop computers equipped with a videoconferencing option (audio and video), and a fourth party may be conferenced via a telephone, but he or she may only be able to speak and listen to the other parties on the call. To provide high-quality real-time mixed media collaboration in a LAN and LAN environment, important performance requirements for packet delays (such as call post-dialing delays) and media blocking must be met. This paper presents an overview of the MMCX and its performance analysis. A design tool based on our analysis has been developed to run in a PC/Windows-based environment that can be used interactively to design and reconfigure MMCX-based networks.																			1089-7089					SPR	1997	2	2					15	35		10.1002/bltj.2046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bltj.2046													WOS:A1997XT55400003

The stochastic fluctuations of system parameters, which are characterized by a set of random variables, are considered in the individual CVNNs. Firstly, the synchronization issue is solved for the considered coupled CVNNs. By the use of the Lyapunov stability theory and the Kronecker product, a synchronization criterion is proposed to guarantee that the coupled CVNNs are asymptotically synchronized in the mean square. Subsequently, the state estimation issue is studied for the identical coupled CVNNs via available measurement output. By establishing a suitable Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions are derived under which the mean square asymptotic stability of the estimation error system is ensured and the design scheme of desired state estimator is explicitly provided. Finally, two numerical simulation examples are shown for the purpose of illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed theory. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Slow clocks, while desirable for synchronizing low data rate P2P networks and minimizing power consumption, are difficult to realize with analog relaxation oscillators. We present a digital counter based design as an alternative and characterize the unique issues that emerge from the discreteness of this design in both time and level. We discover that the discrete nature of this circuit gives rise to two alternative approaches to pulse coupling, and find that the one that delays the reset of the counter is a significantly better choice for enabling high quality synchronization with lower cost in time-to-synchronize. We present a final design in 65nm CMOS based upon this analysis.																			0271-4302		978-1-4799-8391-9				2015							1314	1317																WOS:000371471001149

Robustness is a key index of the stable operation for the supply chain network. We investigate a fuzzy robust strategy to realize the robust operation of the supply chain network with the production lead times and the ordering lead times under the uncertain customer demand. A discrete switched model of the dynamic supply chain network with the lead times and the uncertain customer demand is established based on T-S fuzzy systems. Then a fuzzy switched strategy is proposed to control the switching actions among subsystems. Furthermore, by introducing the inhibition rate.., a fuzzy control strategy for the dynamic supply chain network is put forward to suppress the impacts of the lead times and the uncertain customer demand on the operation of the dynamic supply chain network. The fuzzy robust strategy composed of the fuzzy switched strategy and the fuzzy control strategy can guarantee the robust operation of the supply chain network at low cost. Finally, the simulation researches show the advantage of the proposed fuzzy robust strategy through the comparisons with the common robust strategy.					穆, 儒/HGC-6534-2022														1076-2787	1099-0526					2018									3495096	10.1155/2018/3495096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/3495096													WOS:000423577400001

To avoid an expensive massive deployment, we try to take advantage of possible coverage overlaps over space and time, by introducing a novel combinatorial model that captures such overlaps. Under this model, we abstract the tracking network design problem by a combinatorial problem of covering a universe of elements by at least three sets (to ensure that each point in the network area is covered at any time by at least three sensors, and thus being localized). We then design and analyze an efficient approximate method for sensor placement and operation, that with high probability and in polynomial expected time achieves a e (log n) approximation ratio to the optimal solution. Our network design solution can be combined with alternative collaborative processing methods, to suitably fit different tracking scenarios. (c) 2008 Elsevier BX All rights reserved.

J	Dempsey, BJ; Liebeherr, J; Weaver, AC				Dempsey, BJ; Liebeherr, J; Weaver, AC			On retransmission-based error control for continuous media traffic in packet-switching networks	COMPUTER NETWORKS AND ISDN SYSTEMS												Distribution of continuous media traffic such as digital audio and video over packet-switching networks has become increasingly feasible due to a number of technology trends leading to powerful desktop computers and high-speed integrated services networks. Protocols supporting the transmission of continuous media are already available, In these protocols, transmission errors due to packet loss are generally not recovered. Instead existing protocol designs focus on preventive error control techniques that reduce the impact of losses by adding redundancy, e.g., forward error correction, or by preventing loss of important data, e.g., channel coding. The goal of this study is to show that retransmission of continuous media data often is, contrary to conventional wisdom, a viable option in most packet-switching networks. If timely retransmission can be performed with a high probability of success, a retransmission-based approach to error control is attractive because it imposes little overhead on network resources and can be used in conjunction with preventive error control schemes. Since interactive voice has the most stringent delay and error requirements, the study focuses on retransmission in packet voice protocols. An end-to-end model of packet voice transmission is presented and used to investigate the feasibility of retransmission for a wide range of network scenarios, The analytical findings are compared with extrapolations from delay measurements of packet voice transmission over a campus backbone network.

We investigate the benefits of adding a few infrastructure nodes to an otherwise ad hoc network to improve its performance. These infrastructure nodes are interconnected among themselves with point-to-point (p2p) links in addition to Wi-Fi capability. To evaluate the benefit of ad hoc networks with mixed broadcast wireless and point to point links, we modify an existing ad hoc routing protocol to automatically discover routes emphasizing p2p links and simulated several ad hoc and mixed networks using the Glomosim simulator. Our results show that adding a small number of point-to-point links makes a significant difference in performance with 2-3 times higher throughput and up to 2-3 times lower packet delays.																			2331-9852		0-7803-8784-8				2005							7	12																WOS:000228181400002

The importance of this study is supported by the growing applications of chaotic systems for improving the security of data transmission in various communication layers, primarily on the physical layer. The hybrid analog-discrete approach of implementing chaos oscillators opens new possible communication schemes for wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. The analog implementation of chaos oscillators can benefit the simpler sensor node (SN) integration, while the discrete implementation can be used on the gateway. However, the core of such chaos-based communications is synchronizing analog and discrete chaos oscillators. This work studies two key parameters of analog-discrete chaotic synchronization: chaotic synchronization noise immunity and synchronization speed. The noise immunity study demonstrates the quality of synchronization at various noise levels, while the synchronization speed demonstrates how quickly the analog-discrete synchronization is achieved, along with how quickly the two systems diverge when synchronization is no longer present. The two studies use both simulation-based and hardware-based approaches. In the simulation case, the analog oscillator's circuit is modeled in LTspice XVII, while in the hardware case, the circuit is implemented on the PCB. In both simulation and hardware studies, the discrete model of the oscillator is implemented in MATLAB R2023b. The studies are performed for two pairs of different chaos oscillators to widen the proposed approach application potential: the Vilnius and RC chaos oscillators. The oscillators have been selected due to their simplicity and similar dynamic behavior for model-based and electrical circuit implementation. The proposed approach also allows us to compare the synchronization of different oscillators in the analog-discrete implementation.

The long simulation time significantly slows down the speed of optimization iterations for both human designers and automatic AMS optimizers, inevitably resulting in high design costs and less-optimized designs. In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based early performance assertion (CEPA) scheme to identify designs with unsatisfactory performance quickly and accurately. Thanks to the feature extraction capability of CNN, CEPA only requires a short duration of transient waveform to predict the satisfaction of the target specifications for a certain design that is otherwise obtained by a long transient simulation. In addition, applying the fine-tuning technique to the proposed CEPA scheme can further extend the inference from schematic-level simulation to post-layout simulation with only a few training samples (i.e., enhancing CEPA's usage with a low training cost). A sample and-hold circuit and a delta-sigma digital-to-analog converter are presented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed CEPA scheme. With its maximum assertion accuracy of 99%, CEPA reduces the simulation time for assertion by orders of magnitude.

These VSCs are formulated for the systems with different kinds of uncertainties using switching or nonswitching types of techniques. The performance of these controllers depends not only on the control structure but also on the values of the controller's parameters. In this context, an artificial immune system (AIS) can be useful to tune the VSCs' parameters. AISs represent a field of biologically inspired computing that attempts to exploit theories, principles, and concepts of modern immunology to design immune system-based applications in science and engineering, mainly in learning and optimization applications. This paper presents an AIS approach applied to optimize the design of an incremental discrete VSC for minimizing the generalized minimum variance strategy.

Design of a routing protocol that exploits the availability of directional antennas in wireless ad hoc networks	MILCOM 2006, VOLS 1-7					IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM 2006)	OCT 23-25, 2006	Washington, DC	IEEE				We present a new distributed routing protocol for direct-sequence spread-spectrum, mobile ad hoc packet radio networks that contain a mix of nodes with directional antennas and nodes with omnidirectional antennas. Two components of the routing protocol are jointly designed: a new congestion-based link metric that is utilized to identify multiple routes with low levels of congestion and a new forwarding protocol that can dynamically split traffic among the multiple routes based on the relative capabilities of the routes. To be able to efficiently exploit the nodes with the directional antennas, our routing approach accounts for the additional capabilities of these nodes and utilizes multiple routes to a destination if the routes exhibit low mutual coupling. We show that our joint routing and forwarding approach provides substantial improvements in network performance compared to a scheme that simply selects minimum-hop routes. Our investigations demonstrate that the most significant gains in network performance are achieved in networks in which there is a mix of nodes with different types of antennas, but gains in network performance are also achieved in networks in which all nodes employ onmidirectional antennas only.

Next, by integrating IFNMs with the information and traffic coupled cell transmission model (IT-CTM) model developed by Du et al. [16] for capturing the information front propagation dynamics on a road segment, we establish a discrete mathematical simulation framework (IFNM-CTM) to track the information front spreading dynamics over a road network at discrete time stamps. Furthermore, by combining the IFNM-CTM framework and the deep search algorithms, this study tracks the information coverage dynamics and investigates its correlation to traffic congestion evolution over a traffic network at discrete time stamps. Our experiments built upon Sioux Falls city network indicate that the IFNM-CTM is able to track the information front spreading, including location and coverage, accurately with the mean absolute error (MAE) less than 6% and 5%, respectively. More importantly, our studies found a strong correlation existing between information front spreading dynamics and traffic congestion evolution over the network. Specifically, a mild congestion condition (i.e., LOS C and D) provides the best traffic condition to sustain information spreading as compared to sparse (i.e., LOS A or B) and heavily congested (i.e., LOS E or F) traffic conditions since neither of them can sustain stable and constant wireless communication due to the limited transmission range of DSRC and interference issues.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

J	Piepho, HP				Piepho, Hans-Peter			Network-meta analysis made easy: detection of inconsistency using factorial analysis-of-variance models	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY												Background: Network meta-analysis can be used to combine results from several randomized trials involving more than two treatments. Potential inconsistency among different types of trial (designs) differing in the set of treatments tested is a major challenge, and application of procedures for detecting and locating inconsistency in trial networks is a key step in the conduct of such analyses. Methods: Network meta-analysis can be very conveniently performed using factorial analysis-of-variance methods. Inconsistency can be scrutinized by inspecting the design x treatment interaction. This approach is in many ways simpler to implement than the more common approach of using treatment-versus-control contrasts. Results: We show that standard regression diagnostics available in common linear mixed model packages can be used to detect and locate inconsistency in trial networks. Moreover, a suitable definition of factors and effects allows devising significance tests for inconsistency. Conclusion: Factorial analysis of variance provides a convenient framework for conducting network meta-analysis, including diagnostic checks for inconsistency.

A new neural network-based approach for self-tuning control of nonlinear multi-input multi-output dynamic systems	2009 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	Proceedings of the American Control Conference				American Control Conference 2009	JUN 10-12, 2009	St Louis, MO					This paper presents a new neural network-based approach for self-tuning control of nonlinear MIMO dynamic systems. According to the approach, a neural network ARMAX (NN-ARMAX) model of the system is identified and continuously updated, using an online training algorithm. Control design is accomplished by solving an optimal discrete-time linear quadratic tracking problem using an observable block companion form Kalman innovation model, which is built from the parameters of a local linear version of the NN-ARMAX model. The state-feedback control law is implemented using the Kalman estimated state, which is calculated without estimating the noise covariance properties. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is illustrated using a simulation example.																			0743-1619		978-1-4244-4523-3				2009							3561	+		10.1109/ACC.2009.5160464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160464													WOS:000270044901259
J	Chu, XA; Li, MG				Chu, Xiaoan; Li, Muguo			<i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> non-fragile observer-based dynamic event-triggered sliding mode control for nonlinear networked systems with sensor saturation and dead-zone input	ISA TRANSACTIONS												This paper considers the problem of robust non-fragile observer-based dynamic event-triggered sliding mode control (SMC) for a class of discrete-time Lipschitz nonlinear networked control systems subject to sensor saturation and dead-zone input nonlinearity. First, an improved dynamic event-triggered scheme (DETS) in consideration of sensor saturation is proposed to reduce the number of data transmission. Next, a non-fragile observer is designed to estimate the system state, which facilitates the construction of the discrete sliding surface. By using a reformulated Lipschitz property, the error dynamics and sliding mode dynamics are modeled as a unified linear parameter varying (LPV) networked system with time-varying delays. Then, based on this model, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the resulting closed-loop system to be asymptotically stable with a given disturbance attenuation level. Furthermore, an observer-based event-triggered SMC law is designed to drive the trajectories of the observer system onto a region near equilibrium point in a finite time in the presence of dead-zone input nonlinearity. Finally, two practical examples are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitivity of service coverage evaluation for WCDMA systems	2007 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYMPOSIUM	Wireless Telecommunications Symposium				Wireless Telecommunications Symposium	APR 26-28, 2007	Pomona, CA	IEEE				A fundamental problem in third generation WCDMA network design is that of evaluating user service coverage and resource utilisation, or load, that a trial/candidate network design can sustain. A network design constitutes base station location and infrastructure configuration. It is convention to evaluate network designs using a range of traffic snapshots, each representing a different static geographical distribution of users with particular requests for heterogeneous services. However service coverage evaluation in WCDMA systems is nontrivial because per-link power allocations are required in response to interference from the power allocated to other users. We investigate the sensitivity of two fundamental variables associated with snapshot evaluation-priorities for admission and the mix of requested services. This is carried out in detail for the downlink scenario using a highly efficient offline evaluation technique that avoids recourse to lengthy simulation of online system power control. The results expose the significant influence that the variables have on the resultant evaluation of a candidate network design using a single traffic snapshot. This is important knowledge for network planning.

Given a baseline behavioral system model, e.g. a semi-formal UML activity diagram, which actions are annotated with timing properties specified with user-defined general discrete time distributions and formalized timing requirements, this method helps to analyze the occurrence of timing errors. The method comprises a specific baseline model reduction, the mapping of the semi-formal model into a formal stochastic Petri net model, and the generation of a discrete-time Markov chain model. The results allow the design verification and the comparison of various design options regarding the timing behavior in early design phases.

First of all, by choosing a modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing the property of conditional mathematical expectation, a novel delay-dependent approach is developed to deal with the mean-square exponential stability problem and H-infinity control problem. Then, a mean-square exponentially stable and Markovian jump filter is designed such that the filtering error system is mean-square exponentially stable and the H-infinity performance of estimation error can be ensured. Besides, the derivative of discrete time-varying delay h(t) satisfies h(t) <= eta and simultaneously the decay rate beta can be finite positive value without equation constraint. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.																			0023-5954						2014	50	4					491	511																WOS:000345493300002

This paper proposes a mixed backpressure index for a path considering both its throughput and the movement occupancies. With this index, we propose a one-step control to optimize the network-wide signal timing plans every time step embedded with a path-based store-and-forward model and extend it to multi-step by applying model predictive control methodology for the purpose of avoiding erratic switching among stages. Both the one-step and multi-step control are equivalently translated into mixed-integer linear programming problems for computational efficiency. The results of a numerical study on a calibrated network of Caohejing District in Shanghai indicate that the mixed backpressure index based methods provide better performance in terms of delay time as well as maximum queue length than other throughput-optimal methods. Additionally, they allow for relatively fair distribution of delay time associated with paths with appropriate parameter design.																			2153-0009		978-1-7281-9142-3				2021							2484	2491		10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564645													WOS:000841862502075

Application of Paths Information in Network Design Problem	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING												In a discrete network design problem, an optimal subset is chosen from a set of proposed link additions to an existing road network in order to minimize the total cost of users. The problem has been called as a complex issue in the transportation planning literature. The main source of complexity is that the problem is a bilevel program in which the lower-level program is a traffic assignment problem. In this paper, a path-based traffic assignment problem is used as the lower-level problem. The path-based algorithms not only provide the link-flow solution, but also the useful path-flow solution (path information) that may be required or used in certain applications, such as network design problem. To solve a network design problem, the traffic assignment problem will need to be solved many times. The main objective of this paper is to expedite the solution of the network design problem by initializing traffic assignment problems with path sets already found in previously performed traffic assignments. The rationale behind this idea is that the addition of a number of proposed links to a network will not change the used paths for the majority of origin-destination (OD) pairs. In this paper, the network design problem is solved by a branch and bound algorithm for a small network and a relatively large network. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of reducing the computation time to one-fifth in real-size networks. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000389.

The design task is posed in mathematical terms as a multi-objective mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, in which life cycle assessment (LCA) principles are used to quantify the environmental impact. One of the advantages of our approach is that it accounts for the simultaneous minimization of several environmental metrics, as opposed to other models that focus on minimizing a single aggregated indicator. To avoid the difficulties associated with the presence of several environmental objectives in the multi-objective model, we investigate the use of a rigorous mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) dimensionality reduction method. The capabilities of our approach are tested through two examples. We clearly illustrate how the use of a single overall aggregated environmental metric is inadequate in the design of HEN, since it may leave some solutions that are appealing for decision-makers out of the analysis. Our method allows identifying in a systematic manner key LCA metrics that preserve the problem structure. This technique aids decision-making at the early stages of the design of HEN.

It builds an important network security mechanism to implement anonymous communication and has a wide range of applications like AI training and online services. So far, security of mix nets is only analysed in theoretic cryptographic models, and their security in real-world systems has not drawn enough attention from researchers. In this paper, several popular commercial mix net services are surveyed and they have a common strategy: developing an academic shuffling scheme into a real-world mix net system and assuming that its theoretic security properties can guarantee robustness of the systems in practical usages. Our analysis illustrates that the straightforward assumption is not reliable and a mix net has to face various challenges and attackers beyond their academic prototypes estimate. Especially, we show that in practice some users of a mix net may collude with the service providers to compromise reliability of the mix net, which is a realistic environment factor usually ignored in cryptographic protocol design. So, the anonymous communication services based on mix net in practical usage are not so reliable as widely believed and their applications in network security have non-negligible vulnerabilities or risks.																					979-8-4007-0098-9				2023							539	551		10.1145/3579856.3595785	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3579856.3595785													WOS:001053857900043

In this paper, we consider the problem of upgrading an existent network in order to enhance its robustness to events involving multiple node failures. This problem is modeled as a bi-objective mixed linear integer formulation considering both the minimization of the cost of the added edges and the maximization of the robustness of the resulting upgraded network. As the robustness metric of the network, we consider the value of the Critical Node Detection (CND) problem variant which provides the minimum pairwise connectivity between all node pairs when a set of c critical nodes are removed from the network. We present a general iterative framework to obtain the complete Pareto frontier that alternates between the minimum cost edge selection problem and the CND problem. Two different approaches based on a cover model are introduced for the edge selection problem. Computational results conducted on different network topologies show that the proposed methodology based on the cover model is effective in computing Pareto solutions for graphs with up to 100 nodes, which includes four commonly used telecommunication networks.					de Sousa, Amaro/J-3571-2016; Agra, Agostinho/H-7019-2012	Agra, Agostinho/0000-0002-4672-6099													0305-0548	1873-765X				DEC	2021	136								105453	10.1016/j.cor.2021.105453	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2021.105453		JUL 2021											WOS:000693669100004

Standardisation was designed to follow ICUMSA, a standard based on chemical process. System was designed to identify ICUMSA value of granulated sugar from its image. System was designed as Multi-Level Perceptron Artificial Neural Network with one hidden layer of five neurons using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with output trained to follow known ICUMSA values. Colour and textural features were extracted from 180 images of granulated sugar for Artificial Neural Network inputs. Colour moments, Haralick features, and symlet wavelet transform were used as features. After feature reduction, the designed system correctly identified ICUMSA and classified the 6 samples of granulated sugar with 3.623% of error.																					978-1-4799-5303-5				2014							90	95																WOS:000361486900018

Through allocating bandwidth, the quantized scheduling strategy and feedback controller design are considered simultaneously. The quantized measurement signals are dealt with by utilizing the sector bound method, in which the quantization error is treated as sector-bounded uncertainty, and the NCS is modeled as a discrete-time switching system with parameter uncertainties. Based on the Lyapunov function and period switching system theory, a design procedure for feedback controller under this strategy is given to maintain the asymptotic stability of closed-loop system.

Performance analysis of a GI/D-MSP/1/ queueing system under different service phase initiations	OPSEARCH												The main objective of this paper is to derive some analytic results concerning GI/D-MSP/1/ queueing model in which customers arrive according to a discrete-time renewal process. We assume that the service process is correlated and its configuration is designed through discrete-time Markovian service process under different service phase initiations to start a busy period. The system-length distributions at various time epochs have been obtained by employing the matrix-geometric approach. An explicit closed form expression for the waiting-time distribution in the queue measured in slots has also been derived. Computational experiences with a variety of numerical results are discussed to show the effect of system parameters on the performance measures. This queueing model has potential applications in the domain of computer networks, telecommunication systems, and wireless local communication networks for evaluating the various system performances. An application of this type of queueing model in the domain of network coding in wireless communications is also discussed. This provides relevant information to the system analysts, researchers, and industry people who are interested to investigate congestion problems using queueing theory.

The design-coordination productivity and information-exchange patterns are analysed for a unique case where two towers, A and B, of a hospital project deployed two different design coordination strategies in a 2D and BIM mixed-construction environment. The tower A strategy coordinated designs using drawings as the main source of information and confirmed them using BIM (BIM-assisted coordination), whereas the tower B strategy coordinated designs using BIM and confirmed them using drawings (BIM-led coordination). The coordination productivity was 228% faster for tower B than for tower A. The frequency of design changes was much lower for tower B (0.42 times/drawing) than for tower A (2.13 times/drawing). As the result, the design coordination for tower A was delayed by 9.3 months, whereas tower B was completed rapidly and without any delay. A social network analysis revealed that the BIM-led coordination was supported by the relatively even distribution of information, the reduced control of an mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) engineer over a project, and higher accessibility to the information for every project participant.

J	Hirata, K; Fukuchi, Y; Muraguchi, M				Hirata, Kouji; Fukuchi, Yutaka; Muraguchi, Masahiro			Dynamic lightpath establishment considering four-wave mixing in multifiber WDM networks	PHOTONIC NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS												This paper proposes a dynamic lightpath establishment scheme considering four-wave mixing (FWM) in multifiber wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) all-optical networks. The FWM is one of the most important physical impairments to be resolved in WDM networks because the FWM induces nonlinear inter-channel crosstalk and decays the performance of WDM networks. In WDM networks, data are transmitted via lightpaths. When the effect of FWM crosstalk is large, it is highly possible that data transmission fails even if lightpaths are correctly established. The proposed scheme aims to avoid not only the blocking of lightpath establishment but also the accumulation of FWM crosstalk by means of ingenious selection of routes, wavelengths, and fibers for lightpath establishment. In the proposed scheme, a route and a wavelength are selected for each lightpath based on wavelength availability and wavelength placement of established lightpaths. Furthermore, fibers on the route are selected based on estimated FWM power. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through simulation experiments.																			1387-974X	1572-8188				DEC	2013	26	2-3					120	130		10.1007/s11107-013-0414-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11107-013-0414-2													WOS:000327089100009

Simultaneous synthesis of MENs is typically done through the use of mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) optimization, with simplifications made in the mathematical representations of the exchangers due to computational difficulty in solving large non-convex mixed-integer problems. The methodology proposed in this study makes use of the stage-wise based superstructure MINLP formulation for the network synthesis. This stage-wise superstructure model incorporates fixed mass transfer coefficients, fixed column diameters, no pressure drops, and unequal compositional mixing for models. In this paper, the simplified MINLP model is further improved by including a detailed individual packed column design in a non-linear programming (NLP) sub-optimization step, where orthogonal collocation is utilized for the partial differential equations, and optimal packing size, column diameter, column height, pressure drops, and fluid velocities. Detailed designs are then used to determine correction factors that update the simplified stage-wise superstructure models to more accurately portray the chosen design. Once the MINLP is updated with these correction factors, the model is re-run, with new correction factors obtained. This iterative procedure is repeated until convergence between the objective function of the MINLP and that of the NLP sub-optimization is achieved, or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. The methodology is applied to two examples and is shown to be robust and effective in generating new topologies, and in finding superior networks that are physically realizable.

J	Ding, SB; Wang, ZS				Ding, Sanbo; Wang, Zhanshan			Stochastic exponential synchronization control of memristive neural networks with multiple time-varying delays	NEUROCOMPUTING												As an indispensable part of memristive synaptic weights, the switching jumps can induce instability, oscillation or even chaos to the memristive network system. Based on the available information of the switching jumps, this paper is concerned with the stochastic exponential synchronization of a class of memristive neural networks with multiple time-varying delays. By using stochastic differential inclusions and Lyapunov stability theory, discontinuous state feedback controller which depends upon the switching jumps is proposed. Compared with the previous state feedback scheme, more information of memristive synaptic weights is used to design the synchronous controller which ensures the stochastic exponential synchronization of considered networks. When the information of switching jumps is incomplete, discontinuous adaptive controller which is independent of the switching jumps is also designed, thus the applicability of synchronization is broadened. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed design techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design of state estimator for genetic regulatory networks with time-varying delays and randomly occurring uncertainties	BIOSYSTEMS												In this paper, the design problem of state estimator for genetic regulatory networks with time delays and randomly occurring uncertainties has been addressed by a delay decomposition approach. The norm-bounded uncertainties enter into the genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) in random ways, and such randomly occurring uncertainties (ROUs) obey certain mutually uncorrelated Bernoulli distributed white noise sequences. Under these circumstances, the state estimator is designed to estimate the true concentration of the mRNA and the protein of the uncertain GRNs. Delay-dependent stability criteria are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities by constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and using some inequality techniques (LMIs). Then, the desired state estimator, which can ensure the estimation error dynamics to be globally asymptotically robustly stochastically stable, is designed from the solutions of LMIs. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed estimation schemes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Xiao, ZM; Li, TS; Li, ZF				Xiao, Zhongming; Li, Tieshan; Li, Zifu			A novel single fuzzy approximation based adaptive control for a class of uncertain strict-feedback discrete-time nonlinear systems	NEUROCOMPUTING												This paper investigates the problem of adaptive fuzzy control for a class of uncertain nonlinear strict-feedback discrete-time systems with unknown system functions and control gain functions. Following the idea of single neural network (SNN) approximation, single fuzzy logic system(SFLS) approximation is first proposed and synthesized with "minimal learning parameter (MLP)" technique into a novel adaptive fuzzy control design methodology for the concerned systems. With the help of the MLP technique, the problem of "curse of dimension" is circumvented, and the adaptive mechanism with minimal learning parameterization is achieved. Meanwhile, by employing the SFLC approximation in the adaptive control synthesis, all unknown functions at the intermediate steps are passed down in the controller design process, and only one fuzzy logic system (FLS) is employed to deal with the lumped unknown functions at the last step. Following this approach, the problem of "explosion of complexity" inherent in backstepping method is also avoided, and the designed controllers contain only one actual control law and one adaptive law. Thereby, the number of parameters updated online for the entire discrete-time system is reduced to only one. As a result, the controller is much simpler, the computational burden is much lighter and the learning time tends to much shorter. The closed-loop stability in the sense of semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) can be guaranteed via Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation results via two examples are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, several real-world systems have been proposed to leverage network coding in wireless networks. Although the theoretical foundations of network coding are well understood, a real-world system needs to solve a plethora of practical aspects before network coding can meet its promised potential. These practical design choices expose network coding systems to a wide range of attacks. In this paper, we identify two general frameworks that encompass several network coding-based systems proposed for unicast in wireless networks. Our systematic analysis of the components of these frameworks reveals vulnerabilities to a wide range of attacks, which may severely degrade system performance. Adequate understanding of these threats is essential to effectively design secure practical network coding systems.																					978-1-4244-2651-5				2008							33	38		10.1109/NPSEC.2008.4664878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/NPSEC.2008.4664878													WOS:000264131700007

Effect of Asphalt Content on the Marshall Stability of Asphalt Concrete Using Artificial Neural Networks	SCIENTIA IRANICA TRANSACTION A-CIVIL ENGINEERING												The Marshall Stability of asphalt concrete is one of the most important parameters in,mix design. and quality control. This property depends on many factors such as gradation, percentage of crushed aggregates, asphalt content and construction quality. In this research, the variation of Marshall Stability with asphalt content is simulated using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with a Levenberg-Marquardt Back Propagation (LMBP) training algorithm. The percentage of crushed aggregates; the percentage passing through sieve numbers 200, 50, 30, 8, 4 and 1/2 inch; and the percentage of asphalt content are considered as network inputs and Marshall Stability as the network output. In the first stage, the maximum. generalization ability of each network with a specified number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined. Comparing these maximum. values reveals that the network with 8 neurons in the hidden layer has the maximum generalization ability. In the second stage, the variation of Marshall Stability with asphalt content is simulated by applying a sensitivity analysis to the network with the maximum generalization ability. This simulation is in good agreement with theory.

A mixed methods approach to analysing online activity	INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the process of analysing online discussion and argue for the merits of mixed methods. Much research of online participation and e-learning has been either message-focused or person-focused. The former covers methodologies such as content and discourse analysis, the latter interviewing and surveys. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in the context of a study of an online social educational network for gifted students. Design/methodology/approach - The design of this study included the use of content analysis, visualisation diagrams, interviews and questionnaire survey to understand the nature of online discussion and the experience of taking part. Findings - It was found that the message-focused analysis provided insight into participation and interaction patterns, whereas the surveys and interviews enabled access to members' preferences and attitudes. Originality/value - The contribution of the paper is to argue for a mixed approach in which different types of data can be compared and contrasted. While the use of mixed methods in social research in general has long been suggested, its adoption in the field of online learning is yet to be widely established, possibly because of its time-consuming and demanding nature. Despite these constraints, a mixed-methods approach is advocated, as it allows for a comprehensive picture of the use of the network and the experience of online participation.																			1741-5659	1758-8510					2016	13	4					274	288		10.1108/ITSE-09-2016-0032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ITSE-09-2016-0032													WOS:000390713100003

An hidden Markov model (HMM)-based detector with partially known detection probabilities is employed to detect the system modes. With the help of the HMM and an activation function dividing method, a less conservative controller design technique is established. The designed HMM-based controller can be converted to mode-independent/-dependent one by suitably adjusting some design parameters. Finally, the availability of the established HMM-based controller design technique is verified by an illustrative example. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The optimal controller is designed with convergence analysis in terms of cost function and control law. In order to implement the algorithm via globalized dual heuristic programming (CDHP) technique, a neural network is constructed first to identify the unknown nonlinear system, and then two other neural networks are used to approximate the cost function and the control law, respectively. An example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the present approach.

The plant in the networked control system (NCS) under consideration is a discrete stochastic time-delay nonlinear system represented by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. Exponential stability criteria of the NCS are developed by using a common quadratic Lyapunov function and a fuzzy Lyapunov function, respectively. A stabilization controller with convergence rate constraint can be designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities that is numerically feasible with commercially available software.

To address this problem, we present a case study in transparently parallelizing a widely used network simulator, called ns. The use of this parallel ns does not require the modeler to learn any new tools or complex PDES techniques. The paper describes our approach and design choices to build the parallel ns and presents preliminary performance results, which are very encouraging.																					0-7803-6579-8; 0-7803-6580-1				2000							418	424																WOS:000166981000059

Mixed coarse-graining approach has been recently introduced to the elastic network model, so that the protein's native conformation can be modeled with regions of low and high resolution. In the mixed resolution model, each node of the elastic network may represent either a single atom (high-re solution) or a residue (low-resolution), and close-neighboring nodes are connected by harmonic springs. Here, the high-resolution parts constitute the interesting parts of the protein, such as the active site, while the rest of the structure is retained at lower resolution. By performing normal mode analysis of the resulting network, the collective dynamics (low-frequency modes) and consequent conformational changes can be analyzed even for supramolecular assemblages with reasonable computational efficiency, which may serve as a means of incorporating protein flexibility into docking algorithms and drug design. In this study, the mixed coarse-graining methodology is applied to analyze the functional motions of an important enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase.

The first one, which has five ports, consists of a microstrip T-junction as a single-ended-to-single-ended (SETSE) in-phase power division network, and a microstrip/slotline transition as a balanced-to-single-ended (BTSE) out-of-phase power division network. Through the analysis of scattering matrix, a high isolation is obtained in the mixed-mode magic-T. The second one, which consists of a single-ended-to-balanced (SETB) in-phase power division network based on a microstrip T-junction, and a balanced-to-balanced (BTB) out-of-phase power division network based on a slotline T-junction. Taking advantage of the two types of mixed-mode magic-Ts, a BTSE filtering power divider (FPD) and a BTB FPD are investigated, respectively. The characteristics of the mixed-mode magic-Ts make the proposed configurations unique, since most published balanced FPDs based on complex multi-layer structures to achieve miniaturization. The proposed FPDs are integrated with a pair of asymmetric shorted-stub-loaded resonators (ASSLRs). The expected frequencies and bandwidths of the two differential-mode (DM) passbands can be obtained by turning the parameters of ASSLRs. Meanwhile, multiple transmission zeros (TZs) can be generated to improve the passbands selectivity by employing multiple coupling paths. Besides, a high and broadband CM rejection can be generated by introducing U-type balanced port, which simplifies the design process considerably.

These charges form the largest portion of the cost of providing long-distance service. Recent changes in the structure of access rates, which were mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), have created opportunities for long-distance companies to better manage access costs. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based approach to the economic design of access networks. Our novel solution approach combines stochastic aspects of the problem with a challenging discrete facility location problem in a three-phase algorithm.

Hybrid optimization strategy for synthesis of heat exchanger networks	AICHE JOURNAL												We propose a new strategy to synthesize heat exchanger networks with detailed designs of individual heat exchangers. The proposed strategy uses a multistep approach by first obtaining a heat exchanger network topology through solving a modified version of the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) stage-wise superstructure of Yee and Grossmann, which includes a smoothed LMTD approximation and pressure drops. In a second nonlinear programming (NLP) suboptimization step, we allow for nonisothermal mixing to solve problems with or without exchanger bypasses. The selected heat exchangers along with the mass and energy balances obtained are then used to design the network with detailed exchanger designs through solving a sequence of NLPs for individual heat exchanger designs. The NLPs are based on the detailed discretized optimization models of Kazi et al., which solve quickly and reliably to obtain heat exchangers based on rigorous, first-principles derived coupled differential equations. These models solve a differential algebraic equation system and do not rely on usual assumptions associated with other heuristic-based exchanger design methods, such as log mean temperature difference andF(T)correction factors. These detailed exchanger designs are then used to update the network optimization model through sets of correction factors on heat exchanger area, number of shells, heat transfer coefficients, and pressure drops of each exchanger design, in a method based on that of Short et al. The method solves reliably, guaranteeing feasible exchangers for every potential network generated by the shortcut models, through validation with rigorous heat exchanger models at every iteration. In addition, the method does not increase the nonlinearity of the MINLP model, nor does it require any manual intervention or initialization from the user. Three examples are solved and the results are compared to those obtained in the literature.

In this paper, we consider consensus control of discrete-time first-order agents with the communication graph being an expander network. Each agent has a real-valued state but can only exchange symbolic data with its neighbors. A distributed protocol is designed based on dynamic encoding and decoding with finite level uniform quantizers. The choice of the control parameters only depends on the number of agents, the maximum degree and the isoperimetric constant of the network. It is shown that under the protocol designed, averageconsensus can be achieved with an exponential convergence rate based on a single-bit information exchange between each pair of adjacent nodes at each time step. A performance index is given to characterize the total communication energy cost to achieve average-consensus and it is shown that the minimization of the communication energy cost leads to a tradeoff between the convergence rate and the number of quantization levels.

This improvement introduces additional freedom in designing the controller and can increase the length of the period for updating the model state over the networks. Also, the plant can be stabilized by a controller based on a model with lower order than that of the plant. A sufficient condition and a necessary condition for the global exponential stability of the closed-loop system are derived for the case of the plant full state available, and when the plant full state is not available, a sufficient condition is obtained.

Therefore, we should reduce the number of optical signals passing through the same fiber from the perspective of the FWM. Meanwhile, in order to enhance the power efficiency of optical amplifiers, which are deployed at each optical fiber, it is preferred that multiple optical signals are transmitted in the same fiber. In order to decrease the power consumption while keeping high communication quality, the proposed method statically selects routes, wavelengths, and fibers for each traffic demand, considering the FWM crosstalk effect and the usage efficiency of the optical amplifiers. We show the performance of the proposed method through numerical experiments.

In the developed model a simultaneous multi objectives and multi-period optimization are principally investigated. The goal is to simultaneously minimize costs and CO2 emission using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (EMOO) and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Typical days definition and the extension of the post processing phase are the novelty of this work. The proposed method helps the decision maker to know; which type and configuration of poly-generation technologies (centralized and decentralized) are best suited for the district? Is it viable to combine these technologies with other technologies (like heat pumps, solar PV)? Where in the district shall these technologies be implemented (geographically)? what are the optimal flow, supply and return temperatures of the distribution networks (heating and cooling) considering the requirements of the district and the technical limitations of the technologies?

A new stochastic phenomenon (ROGVs), which is governed by a sequence of random variables with a certain probabilistic distribution, is put forward to better reflect the reality of the randomly occurring fluctuation of controller gains implemented in networked environments. A modified stochastic Rice fading model is then exploited to account for both channel fadings and random time-delays in a unified representation. The channel coefficients are a set of mutually independent random variables which abide by any (not necessarily Gaussian) probability density function on [0, 1]. Attention is focused on the analysis and design of a non-fragile H output-feedback controller such that the closed-loop control system is stochastically stable with a prescribed H performance. Through intensive stochastic analysis, sufficient conditions are established for the desired stochastic stability and H disturbance attenuation, and the addressed non-fragile control problem is then recast as a convex optimisation problem solvable via the semi-definite programme method. An example is finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

Moreover, advancing efficiency measures on the consumer-side will lead to decreasing heat demand densities posing economic challenges on the operation of DHN. To sustain economic viability in the future, network operators are therefore confronted with the decision to either adopt post-densification, expansion or decommissioning measures. In order to assess the economic impact of different transformation targets on the DHN topology, an existing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was enhanced to identifying the most cost-effective network design and long-term development of DHN for various transformation strategies. The results of the underlying use case suggest that both excessive network expansion and economically driven decommissioning can be significantly reduced by appropriate transformation strategies which consist of temperature and post-densification measures of varying degrees of intensity. In addition, we were able to show that generalized claims for lowest supply and return temperatures in future DHN, although mostly technically feasible, must not be economically viable intrinsically.

To provide quality of service, the network must be connected, even if one or more nodes drop out. This motivates the notion of k-connectivity. The minimum energy problem aims to optimise the total energy that all nodes spend for transmission. Previous work in the literature includes exact mixed-integer programming formulations for a 1-connected network. We extend these models for when the network is k-connected, and compare the models for various network sizes. As expected, the combinatorial nature of the problem limits the size of the networks that we can solve to optimality in a timely manner. However, these exact models may be used for the future design of mobile ad hoc networks and provide useful benchmarks for heuristics in larger networks.

At first, a switched system containing two modes is formulated based on whether the triggering is executed or not, and the corresponding cost function and output feedback control law are also derived. By giving the formulated switched system, the triggering signal turns into the switching signal and the proposed problem is converted into an optimal control problem for the formulated discrete-time switched system. Secondly, a model network is presented to approximate the system dynamic since the dynamic model is completely unknown. Thirdly, in view of ADP-based optimal control methods of switched systems, critic and actor networks are applied respectively to approximate the optimal cost function and the optimal output feedback control law, and a PI-based online learning method is proposed. When weights of critic and actor networks are obtained and implemented through the proposed online learning method, the optimal triggering signal is derived. Fourthly, the convergent property is given to guarantee the obtained results are optimal. At last, the validity of the proposed method is shown by simulation results of two examples.

These neural networks are simple because they are designed with a simple, computable, and continuous activation function sigma leveraging a triangular-wave function and the softsign function. We first prove that sigma-activated networks with width 36d(2d + 1) and depth 11 can approximate any continuous function on a d-dimensional hypercube within an arbi-trarily small error. Hence, for supervised learning and its related regression problems, the hypothesis space generated by these networks with a size not smaller than 36d(2d + 1) x 11 is dense in the continuous function space C([a, b]d) and therefore dense in the Lebesgue spaces Lp([a, b]d) for p is an element of [1, infinity). Furthermore, we show that classification functions arising from image and signal classification are in the hypothesis space generated by sigma-activated networks with width 36d(2d + 1) and depth 12 when there exist pairwise disjoint bounded closed subsets of Rd such that the samples of the same class are located in the same subset. Finally, we use numerical experimentation to show that replacing the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function by ours would improve the experiment results.

It is noteworthy that there are a large number of neural circuits formed by the coupling relationship in neural networks. However, the vast majority of existing studies on ring-structured networks were restricted to models with fewer neurons or single-ring structure. Here, we design a multi-ring coupling network model, which includes a large number of neurons and multiple rings, to simulate the brain network with multiple neural circuits, and use bifurcation theory to investigate the dynamic behavior of bifurcations and oscillations of the proposed model. Instead of the traditional method, the Coates flow graph method is used to derive explicit expressions for the higher-order determinants of the model. Then, the stability and Hopf bifurcation of the model are studied with the sum of discrete delays of each ring as the bifurcation parameter, and the explicit formula for its critical value is deduced. Our results suggest that in some cases, the stability of the model gradually deteriorates with increasing time delay and eventually destabilizes the system at some critical value. More specifically, the development of the instability (increasing time delay) leads to limit cycle and periodic oscillations, and the amplitude and period of the system are also affected by it.

J	Namdar, A				Namdar, Abdoullah			Forecasting the bearing capacity of the mixed soil using artificial neural network	FRATTURA ED INTEGRITA STRUTTURALE												The bearing capacity of soil changes owing to the mechanical properties of the soil and it influences the structural stability. In most of the geotechnical engineering projects, there are several soil mechanic experiments, that need interpretation before application. The mechanical properties of soil interaction make the prediction of soil bearing capacity complex. However, the enhancement of construction project safety needs the interpretation of soil experiments and design results for proper application in a geotechnical engineering project. In this study, artificial neural network is proposed for the evaluation of the mixed soil characteristics to forecast the safe bearing capacity of soil due to the mechanical properties of the soil interaction phenomenon. The results for prediction of the safe bearing capacity reveal that the R-2 and RMSE for all mechanical properties effects on safe bearing capacity are 0.98 and 0.02, these values can provide a suitable accuracy for the prediction of the safe bearing capacity of the mixed soil. The higher inaccuracy is obtained when only the influence of single mechanical property on the mixed soil is considered in the prediction of the safe bearing capacity. This study supports the enhancement of geotechnical engineering design quality through the prediction of safe bearing capacity from characterized mechanical properties of the soil.

When standard machine learning techniques are applied for cancer classification, they face the small sample size (SSS) problem of gene expression data. The SSS problem is inherited from large dimensionality of the feature space (due to large number of genes) compared to the small number of samples available. In order to overcome the SSS problem, the dimensionality of the feature space is reduced either through feature selection or through feature extraction. For achieving this objective different feature reduction schemes with a set of simple classifiers have been suggested in this paper. Firstly the dimension have been reduced using Principal Component Analysis(PCA), Factor Analysis(FA), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT). Then the reduced dimensions are used to design intelligent classifiers using different Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN). The simulation results demonstrate that the reduction based Chebyshev classifier perform the best compared to other alternatives. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While much progress has been made in their experimental and theoretical characterization, the inverse design of mechanical metamaterials with arbitrarily programmable spectral properties and mode localization remains an unsolved problem. Here, we present a flexible computational inverse-design framework that allows the efficient tuning of one or more gaps at nearly arbitrary positions in the spectrum of discrete phononic metamaterial structures. The underlying algorithm optimizes the linear response of elastic networks directly, is applicable to ordered and disordered structures, scales efficiently in two and three dimensions, and can be combined with a wide range of numerical optimization schemes. We illustrate the broad practical potential of this approach by designing mechanical band-gap switches that open and close preprogrammed spectral gaps in response to an externally applied stimulus such as shear or compression. We further show that the designed structures can host topologically protected edge modes, and validate the numerical predictions through explicit three-dimensional finite-element simulations of continuum elastica with experimentally relevant material parameters. Generally, this network-based inverse design paradigm offers a direct pathway toward manufacturing phononic metamaterials, DNA origami structures, and topoelectric circuits that can realize a wide range of static and dynamic target functionalities.

The proposed joint design enables the coexistence of multiple access/backhaul links at the same channel, resulting in an enhanced spectral efficiency. Moreover, it enables the usage of FD capability when/where it is gainful. In this regard, a mixed-integer-linear-program (MILP) design framework is proposed, aiming at a minimum cost design for the wireless backhaul network, considering the required rate demand at each base station, as well as the various operational limits. The numerical simulations show a reduction in the network cost via the utilization of the proposed designs, thanks to the coexistence of multiple links on the same channel due to the FD capability.																			1525-3511		978-1-5386-1734-2				2018																								WOS:000435542401154

In this paper, we present NoCOUT, a methodology for generating an energy optimized application specific NoC topology which supports both point-to-point and packet-switched networks. The algorithm uses a prohibitive greedy iterative improvement strategy to explore the design space efficiently. A system-level floorplanner is used to evaluate the iterative design improvements and provide feedback on the effects of the topology on wire length. The algorithm is integrated within a NoC synthesis framework with characterized NoC power and area models to allow accurate exploration for a NoC router library. We apply the topology generation algorithm to several test cases including real-world and synthetic communication graphs with both regular and irregular traffic patterns, and varying core sizes. Since the method is iterative, it is possible to start with a known design to search for improvements. Experimental results show that many different applications benefit from a mix of "on chip networks" and "point-to-point networks". With such a hybrid network, we achieve approximately 25% lower energy consumption (with a maximum of 37%) than a state of the art min-cut partition based topology generator for a variety of benchmarks. In addition, the average hop count is reduced by 0.75 hops, which would significantly reduce the network latency.

A filter system model in which the sampled signals are transmitted through the unreliable communication channels is constructed for a positive system. An event-triggered scheme in a linear form, which is different from the prior literatures, is designed to determine whether the signal packet should be transmitted to the filter or not. Network-induced delays are considered while handling the packet transmission. By using the linear Lyapunov function method, a sufficient condition to ensure the existence of the network-based positive filter satisfying l(1)-gain performance is proposed. The desired filter design method for the positive system is presented by using a linear programming approach.

Here we introduce p-cycles as an option in a mixed-method environment to protect demands that do not strictly require dedicated 1+1 APS, but need a faster switching time than provided by shared backup path protection. Results show that in a mixed services environment, realizing such demands with p-cycles rather than 1+1 APS can produce a significant capacity saving. To further explore the potential of mixed-method design, we also test an approach where individual demands are not strictly assigned to be realized by a particular method. Instead, each path may be protected with any method that gives the minimum required service guarantee, but where possible or advantageous in the overall design, paths can be protected by an even faster method than required. For instance, a requirement for 200 ms, usually served by an SBPP realization, may (selectively) be realized instead with p-cycle protection at 80 ms. This optimization of the protection method selection produces a small further capacity savings, but provides a remarkable increase in the number of service paths that enjoy faster protection than strictly required by their class of service specification. When modularity is included, this new design approach provides even greater improvement in protection quality.																					0-7803-8118-1				2003							203	211		10.1109/DRCN.2003.1275358	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DRCN.2003.1275358													WOS:000188794500028
J	Scarborough, C; Grbic, A				Scarborough, Cody; Grbic, Anthony			Generalized Eigenvalue Problem for Spatially Discrete Traveling-Wave-Modulated Circuit Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES												Space-time-modulated electromagnetic structures have become a topic of significant research interest due to their frequency-converting, amplifying, and nonreciprocal properties. In particular, traveling-wave modulation (TWM) is of interest due to its simplicity. Often, TWM is realized by applying staggered time-modulation signals to a discrete array of unit cells. This modulation is referred to as spatially discrete TWM (SDTWM), and the constituent unit cells are called stixels: space-time pixels. Recently, a boundary condition referred to as the interpath relation was derived that relates the field in neighboring stixels. In this article, the interpath relation is applied to SDTWM electrical networks to obtain a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be used to efficiently simulate a cascade of SDTWM stixels. The proposed eigenmode analysis technique is used to simulate three representative SDTWM structures designed to support frequency conversion, parametric amplification, and nonreciprocal propagation. While currently available techniques would require an entire spatial period (or even the whole cascade) to be simulated simultaneously, the presented technique relies only on a single stixel.

J	Zhou, W				Zhou, Wei			A Random Traffic Assignment Model for Networks Based on Discrete Dynamic Bayesian Algorithms	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY												In this paper, a stochastic traffic assignment model for networks is proposed for the study of discrete dynamic Bayesian algorithms. In this paper, we study a feasible method and theoretical system for implementing traffic engineering in networks based on Bayesian algorithm theory. We study the implementation of traffic assignment engineering in conjunction with the network stochastic model: first, we study the Bayesian algorithm theoretical model of control layer stripping in the network based on the discrete dynamic Bayesian algorithm theory and analyze the resource-sharing mechanism in different queuing rules; second, we study the extraction and evaluation theory of traffic assignment for the global view obtained by the control layer of the network and establish the Bayesian algorithm analysis model based on the traffic assignment; subsequently, the routing of bandwidth guarantee and delay guarantee in the network is studied based on Bayesian algorithm model and Bayesian algorithm network random traffic allocation theory. In this paper, a Bayesian algorithm estimation model based on Bayesian algorithm theory is constructed based on network random observed traffic assignment as input data. The model assumes that the roadway traffic distribution follows the network random principle, and based on this assumption, the likelihood function of the roadway online traffic under the network random condition is derived; the prior distribution of the roadway traffic is derived based on the maximum entropy principle; the posterior distribution of the roadway traffic is solved by combining the likelihood function and the prior distribution. The corresponding algorithm is designed for the model with roadway traffic as input, and the reliability of the algorithm is verified in the arithmetic example.

Expanding the scope of distillation network synthesis using superstructure-based methods	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												We study two new challenging problems in distillation network synthesis: (1) how to synthesize a distillation sequence when streams can have variable, including zero, component flows, which is common when the distillation network is simultaneously designed with the reactor network, and (2) how to couple the reactor and distillation networks, especially when there are multiple coupling streams. We introduce a superstructure-based method for distillation sequence synthesis using a "matrix" representation. We use binary variables and mixed-integer constraints to determine the separation task for each distillation column accounting for the possible zero component flows.

We show that WaveY-Net can accurately predict the near-fields in periodic, high dielectric contrast nanostructure arrays, and that it can combine with gradient based algorithms to dramatically accelerate the local and global freeform optimization of diffractive photonic devices by orders of magnitude faster speeds.

It is also shown that the fixed-time convergence result obtained for the FXFNN is independent of initial conditions, unlike most of the existing asymptotical and exponential convergence results. Furthermore, the proposed FXFNN is applied in solving sparse recovery problems, variational inequalities, nonlinear complementarity problems, and min-max problems.

Electrification of a bus system with fast charging stations: Impact of battery degradation on design decisions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												In this paper, we evaluate the cost of the electrification of an existing bus network. We propose a family of bi-objective mathematical models to demonstrate the trade-off between strategic (i.e., battery sizing and the locations of charging stations) and operational decisions (i.e., battery degradation). The proposed mathematical models investigate different charging policies and measure their impacts on overall cost. Battery degradation is estimated by a tailored and linearized semi-empirical approach and is explicitly incorporated in the proposed mixed -integer linear models. The impact of different charging policies on reducing the overall costs is evaluated for a bus network in Rotterdam.

J	Zhang, H; Wang, JM				Zhang, Hui; Wang, Junmin			Combined feedback-feedforward tracking control for networked control systems with probabilistic delays	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												In this paper, we investigate the combined feedbackfeedforward tracking control problem for networked control systems (NCSs) under the discrete-time framework. Network-induced delays, both on the network links from the sensor to the controller (SC) and from the controller to the actuator (CA), are considered. It is assumed that the probability for the occurrence of each delay is known within a set. We apply a predictive scheme to compensate for the CA delay, and propose to design a controller for each network-induced delay. Using the augmentation technique twice, the tracking problem of the NCS is converted to a feedback control problem for delay-free stochastic systems. The stochastic stability and the H8H8 performance of the obtained closed-loop stochastic system are analyzed in terms of a linear matrix inequality and a linear matrix equality. Then, we propose the controller design method by solving a nonlinear trace minimization problem. Finally, an example on the control of a helicopter is given to illustrate the proposed design approach. Copyright (C) 2014 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, CM				Lee, Ching-Min			Observer-based control for a singular Markovian jumping system	ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS												Purpose - For most practical control system problems, the state variables of a system are not often available or measureable due to technical or economical constraints. In these cases, an observer-based controller design problem, which is involved with using the available information on inputs and outputs to reconstruct the unmeasured states, is desirable, and it has been wide investigated in many practical applications. However, the investigation on a discrete-time singular Markovian jumping system is few so far. This paper aims to consider an observer-based control problem for a discrete-time singular Markovian jumping system and provides a set of easy-used conditions to the proposed control law. Design/methodology/approach - According to the connotation of the separation principle extended from linear systems, a mode-dependent observer and a state-feedback controller is designed and carried out independently via two sets of derived necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Findings - A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an admissibility analysis problem related to a discrete-time singular Markovian jumping system is derived to be a doctrinal foundation for the proposed design problems. Amode-dependent observer and a controller for such systems could be designed via two sets of strictly LMI-based synthesis conditions. Research limitations/implications - The proposed method can be applied to discrete-time singular Markovian jumping systems with transition probability p(ij) > 0 rather than the ones with p(ii) = 0. Practical implications -The formulated problem and proposed methods have extensive applications in various fields such as power systems, electrical circuits, robot systems, chemical systems, networked control systems and interconnected large-scale systems. Take robotic networked control systems for example. It is recognized that the variance phenomena derived from network transmission, such as packets dropout, loss and disorder, are suitable for modeling as a system with Markovian jumping modes, while the dynamics of the robot systems can be described by singular systems. In addition, the packets dropout or loss might result in unreliable transmission signals which motivates an observer-based control problem. Originality/value -Both of the resultant conditions of analysis and synthesis problems for a discrete-time singular Markovian jumping system are necessary and sufficient, and are formed in strict LMIs, which can be used and implemented easily via MATLAB toolbox.																			0264-4401	1758-7077					2017	34	1			SI		33	52		10.1108/EC-11-2015-0348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EC-11-2015-0348													WOS:000398271000004

Under the filtering framework with such a filter and the ETT scheme, the networked filtering error system is modeled as a threshold-error-dependent norm bounded uncertain fuzzy time-delay system with the deviations of normalized membership functions. By using the fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a bounded real lemma is obtained such that the filtering error system is asymptotically stable with a prescribed H-infinity attenuation level. Then, two membership function deviation (MFD)-dependent conditions are presented to co-design the ETT scheme and the fuzzy filter. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed MFD design approach.																			1948-9439		978-1-4673-9714-8				2016							968	973																WOS:000383222301037

We present a mixed integer programming model that captures essential design trade-offs for such networks and explicitly incorporates government subsidies, trade tariffs and taxation issues. The resulting formulation can be solved for reasonable size problems with commercially available mathematical programming software. Focusing on special cases of the problem enables us to provide useful insights on preferable international facility networks for various environments.

The DETCA is introduced to adjust the amount of data transmission in the network based on variation of the tracking error while keeping the tracking performance of the system. Stochastic cyber-attacks such as the denial-ofservice and deception attacks are assumed to be encountered during the signal transmitted in the network. A sufficient condition to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the tracking error system is achieved with the Lyapunov stability theory. The tracking controller gain and the event-triggering parameter are co-designed by solving a linear matrix inequality.

The proposed problem considers a large scale, discrete LTI process controlled by a network of agents that may both, collect information about the evolution of the plant, and apply control actions to drive its behavior. The problem makes full sense when local observability/controllability is not assumed and the communication between agents can be exploited to reach system-wide goals, including energy efficiency in these communications. The objective is to provide a fully distributed estimation&control scheme that stabilizes the plant while the upper bound of a given quadratic performance index is minimized.

Several model-based experimental design techniques have been developed for design in domains with partial available knowledge about the underlying process. This article focuses on a powerful class of model-based experimental design called the mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU). The MOCU-based techniques are objective-based, meaning that they take the main objective of the process into account during the experimental design process. However, the lack of scalability of MOCU-based techniques prevents their application to most practical problems, including large discrete or combinatorial spaces. To achieve a scalable objective-based experimental design, this article proposes a graph-based MOCU-based Bayesian optimization framework. The correlations among samples in the large design space are accounted for using a graph-based Gaussian process, and an efficient closed-form sequential selection is achieved through the well-known expected improvement policy. The proposed framework's performance is assessed through the structural intervention in gene regulatory networks, aiming to make the network away from the states associated with cancer.

The hubs help in reducing transportation costs by consolidating products from multiple warehouses and directing the larger shipments to the retailer. The integrated models studied in this paper simultaneously determines three types of decisions: (i) facility location-the number and location of warehouses and hubs, (ii) allocation-assignment of suppliers to located warehouses and retailers to located warehouses via the location hubs, and (iii) inventory control decisions at each located warehouse. The goal is to minimize the facility location, transportation and the inventory costs. A mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation is first presented. The nonlinear integer programming formulation is then transformed into a conic mixed integer program and a novel and compact conic mixed integer programming formulation. Computational runs are conducted using commercial solvers to compare the performance of the different formulations. The compact conic mixed integer programming formulation was found to significantly outperform the other formulations by achieving significant computational savings. The results demonstrate that large scale instances of certain multi-echelon supply chain network design problems can be solved using commercial solvers through intelligent reformulation of the model.																			1566-113X	1572-9427				DEC	2013	13	4					497	514		10.1007/s11067-013-9196-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11067-013-9196-4													WOS:000327876000006

In the studied PE game, the input saturation phenomenon and possible actuator fault are simultaneously taken into consideration. To accelerate the estimation speed, a novel nonlinear fault estimator is designed by introducing a nonlinear function. Then, for the purpose of obtaining the synchronous control strategy for the discrete-time PE games, an approximate Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation is established, which is seldom utilized for the discrete-time approximate dynamic programming in most existing results. It should be noticed that the synchronous control strategy designed based on the approximate HJI equation can be convergent very fast because of its quasi-Newton's iteration form. Furthermore, the sufficient condition is established to guarantee that the studied system is uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a numerical simulation of the hypersonic vehicle system is carried out to validate the proposed methodology.

These models explain phenomena like phase changes, clustering, and scaling. It is necessary to understand these phenomena when designing systems where exact node configurations cannot be known in advance.

Often, multiple CPSs cooperate and interact with each other. Additionally, tasks with different criticality levels have to be handled within the network. The management of such mixed-critical Cyber-Physical Networks (MC-CPNs) is complex. To simplify the design process as well as the operation and maintenance of a MCCPN a comprehensive approach to handle the complexity of MC-CPNs autonomously at runtime is proposed. We strive to develop learning self-adaptation mechanisms that enable and optimize the execution of applications according to their Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements with respect to their criticality. The comprehensive approach is realized by considering the complete system (applications, processors, communication channels, sensors and actuators) and adjusting its parameters (e.g., distribution and parameters of applications, scheduling parameters offered by processors and communication channels, use of data compression) autonomously. Thereby, the whole management and adaptation capabilities are encapsulated into a middleware framework called Chameleon (comprehensive adaptive mixed-criticality supporting middleware for Cyber-Physical Networks). It provides adaptation transparency and realizes a robust and flexible MC-CPN.																					978-1-6654-1647-4				2022										10.1109/PerComWorkshops53856.2022.9767312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PerComWorkshops53856.2022.9767312													WOS:000821801200058
J	Yu, CH; Ma, WJ; Lo, HK; Yang, XG				Yu, Chunhui; Ma, Wanjing; Lo, Hong K.; Yang, Xiaoguang			Optimization of mid-block pedestrian crossing network with discrete demands	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												In many cases, pedestrian crossing demands are distributed discretely along an arterial segment. Demand origins, destinations and crosswalks comprise a pedestrian crossing network. An integrated model for optimizing the quantity, locations and signal settings of mid-block crosswalks simultaneously is proposed to best trade-off the operational performances between pedestrians and vehicles. Pedestrian behavior of choosing crosswalks is captured under a discrete demand distribution. Detour distance and delay at signalized crosswalks are formulated as a measure of pedestrian crossing cost. Maximum bandwidths are modeled in analytical expressions as a measure of vehicular cost. To solve the proposed model, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) based algorithm is designed and employed to obtain the Pareto frontier efficiently. From the numerical study, it is found that there exists an optimal number of mid-block crosswalks. Excess available crosswalks may make no contributions to improvement in pedestrian cost when the constraint of the minimum interval between crosswalks and vehicular cost are taken into account. Two-stage crosswalks are more favorable than one-stage ones for the benefits of both pedestrian and vehicles. The study results show promising properties of the proposed method to assist transportation engineers in properly designing mid-block crosswalks along a road segment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, these environmental benefits may be counteracted by the higher optimal asphalt binder demanded by the WMA-RCAs. In this regard, this research develops a computational model to optimize the WMA-RCA design. In order to build a sufficiently accurate and adaptable model, it was decided to employ Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The ANN implementation was based on the postulates of the statistical learning theory, i.e., preferring to generate learning through low-complexity models.

Their tunability is the feature that makes them unique to conventional RNGs. This paper studies the tunability range of existing p-bit designs reported in the literature, highlighting that existing designs have a limited input voltage range within which the p-bit's stochastic response can be tuned, on the order of sub 0.5 V. This may greatly limit their scalability in large p-bit networks. Accordingly, this work proposes several variant p-bit designs that enable a wider input voltage tunability range and a more continuous response for p-bits. The designs employ both bipolar and continuous stochastic MTJs, and demonstrate an enhancement in the tunability range beyond 4 V (close to half of the supply voltage range).

J	Liu, JL; Yue, D				Liu, Jinliang; Yue, Dong			Event-triggering in networked systems with probabilistic sensor and actuator faults	INFORMATION SCIENCES												This paper investigates the reliable control design for networked control system under event-triggered scheme. The key idea is that only the newly sampled sensor measurements that violate specified triggering condition will be transmitted to the controller, and the main attribute of our approach is that the proposed event-triggered scheme only needs a supervision of the system state in discrete instants and there is no need to retrofit the existing system. Considering the effect of the network transmission delay, event-triggered scheme and probabilistic sensor or actuator fault with different failure rates, a new fault model is proposed. Based on the newly built model, criteria for the exponential stability and criteria for co-designing both the feedback and the trigger parameters are derived by using Lyapunov functional. These criteria are obtained in the form of linear matrix inequalities. A simulation example is employed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A discrete vascular graph model (VGM) is coupled to a double-continuum model (DCM) to determine the amount of administered therapeutic agent that will reach the cancer cells. An alveolar cell carcinoma is considered. The processes in the bigger blood vessels (arteries, arterioles, venules and veins) are described by the VGM. The processes in the alveolar capillaries and the surrounding tissue are represented by a continuum approach for porous media. The system of equations of the coupled discrete/continuum model contains terms that account for degradation processes of the therapeutic agent, the reduction of the number of drug molecules by the lymphatic system and the interaction of the drug with the tissue cells. The functionality of the coupled discrete/continuum model is demonstrated in example simulations using simplified pulmonary vascular networks, which are designed to show-off the capabilities of the model rather than being physiologically accurate.

J	Chen, S; Cui, GM				Chen, Shang; Cui, Guo-min			Uniformity factor of temperature difference in heat exchanger networks	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING												A uniformity factor of temperature difference (UFTD) is proposed and set up to guide the optimization of Heat exchanger network (HEN). At first, the factor is presented to evaluate the whole enhancement of HEN by handling the logical mean temperature difference as two-dimensional discrete temperature field in system. Then, the factor is applied to different HENs, of which the comparison indicates that a more uniform discrete temperature field leads to a lower UFTD which correlated with a better whole enhancement to improve the optimization level of HEN. A novel stage-wise superstructure model where inner utility can be generated is presented for further analysis of correlation between UFTD and the efficiency of HEN, and more optimal HEN structures can be obtained as inner utility added. Inner utility appears to violate the thermodynamic law, but it makes the discrete temperature field more uniform and improves the heat transfer efficiency of the whole HEN, which brings much more profit than the side effect of inner utility. In sum, the UFTD can not only evaluate the optimization level of the HEN, but also be an optimization object to design new HEN with higher efficiency of energy utilization and lower total annual cost.

There is thus a need for the development of an accurate method of identification of moisture-susceptible mixes during laboratory mix design. The objective of this study was to develop a system of identification of poor- and good-performance HMA mixes based on artificial intelligence. The work involved stiffness and strength testing and imaging of pre- and post-conditioned mix samples that were compacted from plant-produced loose mixes with known field performance. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to classify the moisture damage potential of the mixes based on images. As the number of samples was small, transfer learning using a standard CNN architecture (Inception V3) was used, which was pre-trained on a large-scale object identification task. The predictions from the resulting model were 88% accurate, which is higher than the accuracy of statistical analyses of the results of mechanical tests and black pixel analysis. Implementation of the proposed method in laboratory mix design can help engineers in screening poor mixes quickly and with high accuracy.

The multi-objective network design problem using minimizing externalities as objectives: comparison of a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing framework	TRANSPORTATION												Incorporation of externalities in the Multi-Objective Network Design Problem (MO NDP) as objectives is an important step in designing sustainable networks. In this research the problem is defined as a bi-level optimization problem in which minimizing externalities are the objectives and link types which are associated with certain link characteristics are the discrete decision variables. Two distinct solution approaches for this multi-objective optimization problem are compared. The first heuristic is the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the second heuristic is the dominance based multi objective simulated annealing (DBMO-SA). Both heuristics have been applied on a small hypothetical test network as well as a realistic case of the city of Almelo in the Netherlands. The results show that both heuristics are capable of solving the MO NDP. However, the NSGA-II outperforms DBMO-SA, because it is more efficient in finding more non-dominated optimal solutions within the same computation time and maximum number of assessed solutions.

J	Fioretto, F; Pontelli, E; Yeoh, W; Dechter, R				Fioretto, Ferdinando; Pontelli, Enrico; Yeoh, William; Dechter, Rina			Accelerating exact and approximate inference for (distributed) discrete optimization with GPUs	CONSTRAINTS												Discrete optimization is a central problem in artificial intelligence. The optimization of the aggregated cost of a network of cost functions arises in a variety of problems including Weighted Constraint Programs (WCSPs), Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP), as well as optimization in stochastic variants such as the tasks of finding the most probable explanation (MPE) in belief networks. Inference-based algorithms are powerful techniques for solving discrete optimization problems, which can be used independently or in combination with other techniques. However, their applicability is often limited by their compute intensive nature and their space requirements. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a novel inference-based technique, which exploits modern massively parallel architectures, such as those found in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), to speed up the resolution of exact and approximated inference-based algorithms for discrete optimization. The paper studies the proposed algorithm in both centralized and distributed optimization contexts. The paper demonstrates that the use of GPUs provides significant advantages in terms of runtime and scalability, achieving up to two orders of magnitude in speedups and showing a considerable reduction in execution time (up to 345 times faster) with respect to a sequential version.

J	Liu, QS; Sun, L; Tang, XH				Liu, Quansheng; Sun, Lei; Tang, Xuhai			Investigate the influence of the in-situ stress conditions on the grout penetration process in fractured rocks using the combined finite-discrete element method	ENGINEERING ANALYSIS WITH BOUNDARY ELEMENTS												Grouting is widely used to reduce hydraulic conductivity and enhance the strength of rock masses in geotechnical engineering. With the depletion of shallow resources and expansion of human activities, more underground projects are operated in deeper underground under high in-situ stress conditions. Understanding and controlling the grout penetration process under high in-situ stress conditions are critical to optimizing the grouting process in deep underground projects. In this work, we develop a FDEM-grouting model to study the effect of in-situ stress conditions on the grout penetration process by combining the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM) with a grout simulator. The ability of FDEM-grouting to model grout penetration in fracture networks is confirmed by numerical tests compared with analytical solutions. The necessity of considering the effects of the fracture roughness, in-situ stress and HM coupling on the grout penetration process are discussed. A persistent fracture network is designed to investigate the grout penetration process under various in-situ stress conditions. The results show that the in-situ stress conditions can greatly affect the grout penetration in fracture networks. The anisotropic grout penetration under in-situ stress conditions is potentially useful for improving the grouting design.

In this study, emphasis is on cement pastes with manufactured sand and silica fume. An artificial neural network, namely multilayer perceptron, is compared with nine suspension models: two liquid thickness models, the relative concentration of solids and six relative viscosity models based on the relative concentration of solids. Measurements on 107 mixes with filler (0-125 mu m) from manufactured sand are conducted, acquiring yield stress, plastic viscosity, flow resistance ratio and mini slump flow. None of the suspension models offer good correlations to the measured parameters for all mixes, but an increase in prediction accuracy is seen for subsets of materials, especially mixes without silica fume. The artificial neural network outperforms the suspension models, providing a coefficient of determination between 0.84 and 0.91 for all mixes, thus illuminating a new pathway for cement paste rheology modelling.

Rutting depth prediction of hot mix asphalts modified with forta fiber using artificial neural networks and genetic programming technique	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS												The most significant problems in the maintenance of highway networks are low strength against dynamic loads and short service life of pavements. In recent years using additive materials to improve the performance of asphalt mix under dynamic loading has been remarkably developed. Previous research show that adding appropriate polymer materials to hot mix asphalt improves the dynamic properties of these mixtures. A series of dynamic creep test were conducted under different temperatures and stress levels to evaluate rutting performance of asphalt samples. The proposed artificial neural networks (ANN) model for rutting depth has shown good agreement with experimental results. Beside, in this study a comparison is made between the Burgers model and genetic programming (GP) model in estimating the rutting depth of asphalt mix. Performance of the genetic programming model is quite satisfactory. The obtained results can be used to provide an appropriate approach to enhance the performance of asphalt pavements under dynamic loads. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, how to correctly allocate DBLs across a large-scale real -world network is challenging. Simulation-Based Optimization (SBO) methods were utilized in this work to resolve this optimal allocation problem. Traditional discrete SBO methods are intractable when handling high-dimensional, costly, simulation-based Transportation Network Design Problems (TNDPs) using a limited computational budget. Thus, several efficient Machine Learning (ML)-based surrogate models and a Jackknife uncertainty estimator were introduced to existing SBO framework in this work. A number of comparative experiments between proposed methods and frequently-used Gaussian Process (GP)-SBO methods were conducted. A mesoscopic simulation and Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) tool was adopted to evaluate the network performance. The results of numerical studies show that the optimization efficiency of proposed method is significantly higher than that of commonly used GP-based method when dealing with high dimensional problems. A real-world DBLs allocation case study in Guiyang, Guizhou Province, China again proves that efficient ML-based SBO method is capable to take much less CPU runtime to obtain a better solution than traditional method. The optimal DBLs allocation scheme found by one of the efficient ML-based methods raises the network performance by 5.05 %. A total of 1,376 h travel time is saved, and the average travel time per traveler drops by 0.75 min. In conclusion, efficient ML-based SBO method proposed in this study is more promising to handle large-scale, discrete, costly simulation-based DBLs allocation problems within a limited compu-tational budget than common GP-based SBO methods.

J	Zhong, XN; He, HB				Zhong, Xiangnan; He, Haibo			An Event-Triggered ADP Control Approach for Continuous-Time System With Unknown Internal States	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS												This paper proposes a novel event- triggered adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) control method for nonlinear continuous-time system with unknown internal states. Comparing with the traditional ADP design with a fixed sample period, the event- triggered method samples the state and updates the controller only when it is necessary. Therefore, the computation cost and transmission load are reduced. Usually, the event-triggered method is based on the system entire state which is either infeasible or very difficult to obtain in practice applications. This paper integrates a neural-network-based observer to recover the system internal states from the measurable feedback. Both the proposed observer and the controller are aperiodically updated according to the designed triggering condition. Neural network techniques are applied to estimate the performance index and help calculate the control action. The stability analysis of the proposed method is also demonstrated by Lyapunov construct for both the continuous and jump dynamics. The simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and justify the efficiency of the proposed method.

It is therefore not impractical to assume that future sensing operations will involve real time (inelastic) traffic, such as audio and video surveillance, which have strict bandwidth constraints. This in turn implies that future sensor networks will have to cater for a mix of elastic (having no bandwidth constraint requirements) and inelastic traffic. Current state of the art rate control protocols for wireless sensor networks, are however designed with focus on elastic traffic. In this work, by adapting a recently developed theory of utility-proportional rate control for wired networks to a wireless setting, and combining it with a stochastic optimization framework that results in an elegant queue backpressure-based algorithm, we have designed the first-ever rate control protocol that can efficiently handle a mix of elastic and inelastic traffic in a wireless sensor network. We implement this novel protocol in a real world sensor network stack, the TinyOS-2.x communication stack for IEEE 802.15.4 radios and evaluate the real-world performance of this protocol through comprehensive experiments on 20 and 40-node subnetworks of USC's 94-node Tutornet wireless sensor network testbed.

The network design problem (NDP) still has, therefore, an essential and significant role in shaping and sizing urban transportation networks. The literature has traditionally treated the NDP as a bi-level mathematical programming problem or a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). In the bi-level optimization setting, the problem is approached as a leader-follower problem in which the lower level is a user equilibrium (UE) assignment problem as the follower, and the upper level is the network sizing problem as the leader problem. NDP has long been known as a challenging problem, and many solution algorithms have been proposed to solve it. This study proposed an efficient solution algorithm for the continuous network design problem (CNDP). The solution algorithm has been shown empirically to solve the CNDP in a shorter time using partial linearized subgradient methods. The proposed method was applied to a small network that was traditionally used to evaluate the performance of solution algorithms versus Braess's paradox. It was then applied to the Sioux Falls network as a well-known benchmark network to compare the results with previous studies. The proposed method has been shown to run much faster than all the previous studies reviewed in this paper with minimal degradation of accuracy (0.52% lower than the best solution).

The overall system dynamics emerges from the interaction among physical dynamics, computational dynamics, and communication networks. Network uncertainties such as time-varying delay and packet loss cause significant challenges. This paper proposes a passive control architecture for designing NCS that are insensitive to network uncertainties. We describe the architecture for a system consisting of a robotic manipulator controlled by a digital controller over a wireless network and show that the system is stable even in the presence of time-varying delays. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the passivity-based architecture with respect to stability and performance and show that the system is insensitive to network uncertainties.

The low availability of failure data, makes learning generalized models difficult, and constructing generalized models during the design phase often requires a level of understanding of the failure mechanism that elude the designers. In this paper, we present a new, generalized approach to PHM based on two commonly available probabilistic models, Bayesian Networks and Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks, and pose the PHM problem from the perspective of risk mitigation rather than failure prediction.

Eduardo; Cheng, Yu; Zhang, Tao; Jayender, Jagadeesan			A novel dual-network architecture for mixed-supervised medical image segmentation	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS												In medical image segmentation tasks, deep learning-based models usually require densely and precisely annotated datasets to train, which are time-consuming and expensive to prepare. One possible solution is to train with the mixed-supervised dataset, where only a part of data is densely annotated with segmentation map and the rest is annotated with some weak form, such as bounding box. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture called Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), which consists of two separate networks for the segmentation and detection tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the layers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to extract and transfer useful information from the detection task to help the segmentation task. We exploit a variant of a recently designed technique called ?Squeeze and Excitation? in the connection module to boost the information transfer between the two tasks. Compared with existing model with shared backbone and multiple branches, our model has flexible and trainable feature sharing fashion and thus is more effective and stable. We conduct experiments on 4 medical image segmentation datasets, and experiment results show that the proposed MSDN model outperforms multiple baselines.

However, current correlations for Njs suffer from uncertainty from limited experimental databases and limitations due to many parameters that play an important role in Njs determination. A comprehensive computation of the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) was developed based on solid-liquid mixing experiments, which contain 935 datasets for the prediction of Njs. The Njs values were obtained experimentally using Zwietering correlation with different solid loading percentages, solid particle density, solid particle diameter, mixing solvent density, number of impeller blades, impeller diameter, impeller blade hub angle, impeller blade tip angle, the width of the impeller blade and the ratio of the clearance between the impeller and the bottom of the tank with the tank diameter. The RBFNN proved to have a much better ability to accurately predict the desired Njs compared to MLPNN even after decreasing the number of input variables from 11 to 8. Thus, the computational RBFNN model results will be useful for extending the application of a solid-liquid mixing system for estimating the just-suspension speed for stirred tank design.

This approach involves a collaborative design encompassing both software and hardware aspects. Initially, we devised a CNN quantization method tailored for the fixed-point operation characteristics of FPGA, addressing the computational challenges posed by floating-point parameters. We introduce a bit-width strategy search algorithm that assigns bit-widths to each layer based on CNN loss variation induced by quantization. Through retraining, this strategy mitigates the degradation in CNN inference accuracy. For FPGA acceleration design, we employ a flow processing architecture with multiple Processing Elements (PEs) to support mixed-precision CNNs. Our approach incorporates a folding design method to implement shared PEs between layers, significantly reducing FPGA resource usage. Furthermore, we designed a data reading method, incorporating a register set buffer between memory and processing elements to alleviate issues related to mismatched data reading and computing speeds. Our implementation of the mixed-precision ResNet20 model on the Kintex-7 Eco R2 development board achieves an inference accuracy of 91.68% and a computing speed 4.27 times faster than the Central Processing Unit (CPU) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with an accuracy drop of only 1.21%. Compared to a unified 16-bit FPGA accelerator design method, our proposed approach demonstrates an 89-fold increase in computing speed while maintaining similar accuracy.																			2158-107X	2156-5570				DEC	2023	14	12					806	817																WOS:001244472600011

Previous studies on processing the continuous within skyline query focus exclusively on a static road network, where the object attributes and the conditions of roads remain unchanged. However, in real-world applications, object attributes and road conditions inevitably vary with time, which severely limits the applicability of previous studies in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we address the issue of efficiently processing the continuous within skyline query in dynamic road networks with time-varying information. We design three elaborate data structures, the object attribute dominating matrix (OADM), the road distance sorted list (RDSL) and the skyline object expansion tree (SOET), to maintain the information of objects and the road network. Combined with OADM, RDSL and SOET, we develop an efficient algorithm, namely the within skyline object updating algorithm, to provide real-time processing of the time-varying information. Finally, a thorough experimental evaluation is conducted to show the merits of the proposed approaches.

Inspired by the characteristic of the control scheme, a novel sampling-interval-dependent Lyapunov functional (SIDLF) is constructed. The main contribution of the developed Lyapunov functional lies in that the requirement on its positive definiteness is replaced by a looped condition. Then, using some inequality techniques and the discrete-time Lyapunov approach, two sufficient criteria are derived to ensure the locally asymptotical stability of the trivial solutions of closed-loop systems. A unified work is developed that can deal with the presence of the saturation nonlinearity effects, aperiodic sampled-data control, as well as SIDLF. Additionally, two convex optimization schemes, aiming at enlarging the admissible initial region (AIR) and maximizing the upper bound of sampling interval, are respectively presented for designing the desired saturated sampled-data controller gains. A quantitative relationship between the maximum sampling interval and AIR is revealed. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the advantages and effectiveness of the derived theoretical conclusions. (C) 2021 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By applying this algorithm, the digital hardware implementation of such networks becomes easier as a result of the elimination of multipliers. This proposed algorithm consists of two stages. First, the network is trained by using the standard backpropagation algorithm. Weights are then quantized to single powers-of-two values, and weights and slopes of activation functions are adjusted adaptively to reduce sum of squared output errors to a specified level. Simulation results indicate that the multilayer feedforward neural networks with single powers-of-two weights obtained using the proposed algorithm have similar generalization performance as the original networks with continuous weights.

Discrete stochastic models are widely used in computational systems biology to analyze such networks. Often, the models involve a large number of highly uncertain parameters and many interacting chemical species. However, one is often interested in observing the output of one, or a few of the species rather than the entire network. Simulating the complete reaction network is inefficient in such cases. This paper explores the use of surrogate models to learn partial stochastic biochemical reaction networks and enable fast near-instant evaluation. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on a model from the systems biology literature.

By using matrix analysis approach, each local estimator with time-varying gain is designed by minimizing an upper bound of the square error of the estimator. Based on the obtained local estimators, the distributed fusion estimators are designed by establishing a class of convex optimization problems.

However, the performance degradation caused by motor imagery EEG with very low single-to-noise ratio faces several application issues with the use of a BCI system. In this paper, we propose a novel motor imagery classification scheme based on the continuous wavelet transform and the convolutional neural network. Continuous wavelet transform with three mother wavelets is used to capture a highly informative EEG image by combining time-frequency and electrode location. A convolutional neural network is then designed to both classify motor imagery tasks and reduce computation complexity. The proposed method was validated using two public BCI datasets, BCI competition IV dataset 2b and BCI competition II dataset III. The proposed methods were found to achieve improved classification performance compared with the existing methods, thus showcasing the feasibility of motor imagery BCI.

The proposed mathematical model considers the generic problem confronted in the design of a recirculating cooling-water system, including stretching the cooler network design and setting the operation constraints. Besides the original design items, this research probes into how the number of intermediate cooling-water mains influences the performance of a recirculating cooling-water system. We also study how the conditional direct connections between cooling units can decrease the consumption, of the recirculating cooling-water with a little sacrifice of pipeline complexity. Typical representative examples are presented to demonstrate the viability of proposed superstructurebased MINLP formulation. Supported by the results of computer analysis, the network superstructure and its design scheme can effectively accomplish the goal of unraveling the design problem of the recirculating cooling-water system with intermediate cooling-water mains, and proffering the optimal structure in designing the recirculating cooling-water systems.																			0021-9592					MAR	2007	40	3					235	243		10.1252/jcej.40.235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1252/jcej.40.235													WOS:000246044900006

A full-order state estimator is considered that depends on an innovation function made up of two terms: a linear gain and a feedforward neural network that provides a nonlinear contribution. The gain and the weights of the neural network are chosen in such way to ensure the convergence of the estimation error. Such a goal is achieved by constraining the derivative of a Lyapunov function to be negative definite on a sampling grid of points. Under assumptions on the smoothness of the Lyapunov function and of the distribution of the sampling points, the negative definiteness of the derivative of the Lyapunov function is obtained by minimizing a cost function that penalizes the constraints that are not satisfied. Suitable sampling techniques allow to reduce the computational burden required by the network's weights optimization. Simulations results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Secondly, based on input-state structure, we reveal the product structure of circles of a Boolean network. We call this structure the "rolling gears", which, we believe, can be used. to explain many life phenomena. Thirdly, the controllability and observability of Boolean control systems are studied.

The increasing importance of using waste products has led many companies to move toward the design of a closed-loop supply chain network. The current research considers a multilayered closed-loop supply chain for disposable appliances recycling network. Since many parameters, especially demand and costs, are uncertain, discrete random scenarios are used to describe the parameters. The network modeling aimed at maximizing the value of returning products in the reverse network and products manufactured by the forward network. Optimization of the disposable appliance supply chain network is handled by the combined genetic algorithm and robust optimization. Finally, the computational analysis shows that the proposed model obtains effective solutions for the closed-loop network of disposable appliances. Also, the analysis shows that the genetic algorithm has a good convergence. Comparison of different scenarios shows that the objective function is highly sensitive to uncertain parameters. Hence, network modeling based on different scenarios can be a good approach for deciding under uncertainty of parameters.

In order to save the network bandwidth with satisfactory communication reliability during the signal transmissions, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is put forward to regulate the data-packet transmissions from the saturated sensors to the proposed controller. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional dependent on the singular perturbation parameter (SPP), the dynamics of the DTSPSs under the DETM are rigorously analyzed, and an output-feedback controller design scheme is then developed to ensure that, for any SPP not exceeding a prescribed upper bound, the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with a guaranteed H-infinity performance index. By resorting to the convex programming techniques, the desired controller gain is parameterized in light of the feasible solutions to a set of matrix inequalities.

Deciphering the molecular interactions regulating TH17 cell differentiation is particularly critical for novel drug target discovery designed to control maladaptive inflammatory conditions. Using continuous time Bayesian networks over a time-course gene expression dataset, we inferred the global regulatory network controlling TH17 differentiation. From the network, we identified the Prdm1 gene encoding the B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 as a crucial negative regulator of human TH17 cell differentiation. The results have been validated by perturbing Prdm1 expression on freshly isolated CD4(+) naive T cells: reduction of Prdm1 expression leads to augmentation of IL-17 release. These data unravel a possible novel target to control TH17 polarization in inflammatory disorders. Furthermore, this study represents the first in vitro validation of continuous time Bayesian networks as gene network reconstruction method and as hypothesis generation tool for wet-lab biological experiments.

This design includes the construction of an adaptive algorithm to adjust the parameters included in the identifier. The algorithm is obtained based on a special class of controlled Lyapunov functions. The quality of the identification process is characterized using the practical stability framework. Indeed, the region where the identification error converges is derived by the same Lyapunov method. This zone is defined by the power of uncertainties and perturbations affecting the complex-valued uncertain dynamics.

Indeed, the possibility of dynamically adjusting capacity by assembling and disassembling multiple modular pods allows for improved transit service flexibility and efficiency, reducing operator and passenger costs. As such, modular buses are considered particularly advantageous for settings with large variations in passenger demand, permitting en-route capacity adjustment and seamless transfers. In this context, this study presents a model for the design of a feeder bus network operated by autonomous modular buses, accounting for en-route transfers, and a Genetic Algorithm to solve the non-linear mixed integer programming problem arising. Results for a case study in Athens, Greece for an area served by three metro lines are presented and discussed.

A networked switched control system, a special case of such systems, is studied in this paper by making use of linear descriptor system theory. Such a control system is modeled as switched delay systems involving network-induced delay and packet dropout. Sufficient conditions for robust exponential stability are given for a class of switching signals with average dwell time. A design method to stabilize a continuous-time, linear switched plant under a given communication network via a hybrid state feedback controller is proposed.

Integration of growing self-organizing map and continuous genetic algorithm for grading lithium-ion battery cells	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												This study attempts to employ growing self-organizing map (GSOM) algorithm and continuous genetic algorithm (CGA)-based SOM (CGASOM) to improve the performance of SOM neural network (SOMnn). The proposed GSOM + CGASOM approach for SOMnn is consisted of two stages. The first stage determines the SOMnn topology using GSOM algorithm while the weights are fine-tuned by using CGASOM algorithm in the second stage. The proposed CGASOM algorithm is compared with other two clustering algorithms using four benchmark data sets, Iris, Wine, Vowel, and Glass. The simulation results indicate that CGASOM algorithm is able to find the better solution. Additionally, the proposed approach has been also employed to grade Lithium-ion cells and characterize the quality inspection rules. The results can assist the battery manufacturers to improve the quality and decrease the costs of battery design and manufacturing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A network-induced delay which is time-varying but bounded is considered. The new event-triggered mechanism (ETM) presented in this paper is designed based on the predicted system state estimation. A reconstruction calculation module is implemented on the controller node of the control system in order to compensate for the impact of the delay on the state estimation transmitted by the sensor node of the system. By using the proposed controller with the related new ETM, the tracking error can be guaranteed to be norm-bounded, and also the data communication is reduced, while the controller tracking performance remains satisfactory. Finally, in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical method and the superiority of the new ETM, the proposed controller was applied to a networked mobile cart system and some comparative simulations were carried out.																			1220-1766					DEC	2023	32	4					17	26		10.24846/v32i4y202302	http://dx.doi.org/10.24846/v32i4y202302													WOS:001164650200002

We extract the selected features of movable cells and their surroundings, then embed them into cell-wise deep neural networks. We then determine cell priority and legalize them in order using a pixel-wise search algorithm. The proposed framework uses a policy gradient algorithm and several training techniques, including grid-cell subepisode, data normalization, reduced-dimensional state, and network optimization. We aim to resolve the suboptimality of existing sequential legalization algorithms with respect to displacement and wirelength. On average, our proposed framework achieved 34% lower legalization costs in various benchmarks compared to that of the state-of-the-art legalization algorithm.

The sampled interval is deemed as time-varying. The main purpose is to design a sampled-data controller so as to the synchronization error system (SES) is exponentially stable and satisfies a predefined H-infinity/passive performance index simultaneously. Some novel auxiliary function-based integral inequalities are applied to reduce the conservativeness of the presented results, and some effective synchronization criteria are addressed. The gains for the desired controller can be designed by settling an optimization issue in view of the proposed criteria.

J	Li, B; Li, RG; Eryilmaz, A				Li, Bin; Li, Ruogu; Eryilmaz, Atilla			On the Optimal Convergence Speed of Wireless Scheduling for Fair Resource Allocation	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING												In this paper, we study the design of joint flow-rate control and scheduling policies in multihop wireless networks for achieving maximum network utility with provably optimal convergence speed. Fast convergence is especially important in wireless networks that are dominated by the dynamics of incoming and outgoing flows as well as the time-sensitive applications. Yet, the design of fast converging policies in wireless networks is complicated by: 1) the interference-constrained communication capabilities, and 2) the finite set of transmission rates to select from due to operational and physical-layer constraints. We tackle these challenges by explicitly incorporating such discrete constraints to understand their impact on the convergence speed at which the running average of the received service rates and the network utility over a finite time horizon T converges to their limits. In particular, we establish a fundamental fact that the convergence speed of any feasible policy cannot be faster than Omega(1/T) under both the rate and utility metrics. Then, we develop an algorithm that achieves this optimal convergence speed in both metrics. We also show that the well-known dual algorithm can achieve the optimal convergence speed in terms of its utility value. These results reveal the interesting fact that the convergence speed of rates and utilities in wireless networks is dominated by the discrete choices of scheduling and transmission rates, which also implies that the use of higher-order flow-rate controllers with fast convergence guarantees cannot overcome the aforementioned fundamental limitation.																			1063-6692	1558-2566				APR	2015	23	2					631	643		10.1109/TNET.2014.2304421	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2014.2304421													WOS:000353143800022

Observers and controllers that depend on a linear gain and a parameterized function implemented by a feedforward neural network are considered. The gain and the weights of the neural network are optimized in such way to ensure the convergence of the estimation error for the observer and the stability of the closed-loop system for the controller, respectively. This is achieved by constraining the derivative of a quadratic Lyapunov function to be negative definite on a grid of points, penalizing the constraints that are not satisfied. It is shown that suitable sampling techniques such as low-discrepancy sequences, commonly employed in quasi-Monte Carlo methods for high-dimensional integration allow one to reduce the computational burden required to optimize the network parameters. Simulations results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

To stabilize the NCS, we propose a new predictive control design scheme with plant outputs as the only available data. With uniformly globally exponentially stable (UGES) protocols, input-to-state stability of the entire NCS is ensured by small gain theory. In particular, the predictive controller can compensate transmission delays with any finite upper bound under the constraint that the sampling periods of the plant output and the observer output are small enough as well as the constraint that the predictor is accurate enough. The scheme is applied to a benchmark example to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The settling time of fixed-time synchronization can be adjusted to some desired values in advance regardless of the initial conditions. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions and designing delay-dependent feedback controllers, we derive several novel synchronization criteria, which guarantee the considered hybrid coupled networks can achieve fixed-time synchronization.

A Genetic Algorithm for Selection of Fixed-Size Subsets with Application to Design Problems	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE												The R function kofnGA conducts a genetic algorithm search for the best subset of k items from a set of n alternatives, given an objective function that measures the quality of a subset. The function fills a gap in the presently available subset selection software, which typically searches over a range of subset sizes, restricts the types of objective functions considered, or does not include freely available code. The new function is demonstrated on two types of problem where a fixed-size subset search is desirable: design of environmental monitoring networks, and D-optimal design of experiments. Additionally, the performance is evaluated on a class of constructed test problems with a novel design that is interesting in its own right.																			1548-7660					NOV	2015	68	CS1																						WOS:000366015100001

Part III: Three-Dimensional Architectures with an Extended Field of View	ELECTRONICS												In this paper, an innovative procedure is proposed for the design of three-dimensional discrete lens antennas characterized by an extended field of view. While in a companion paper the design procedure was based on the definition of multifocal constrained lenses and on their evolution in rotationally symmetric ones, in this paper, lenses are assumed from the beginning to be rotationally symmetric and are derived by enforcing minimized optical aberrations specifically for the largest scanning directions. It is shown that, for discrete lenses exhibiting a feeding array with a cross section, projected in a plane perpendicular to the main lens axis, larger as compared to the back lens cross section, there are significant improvements (15-20%) in terms of maximum aberrations and, at the same time, similar or slightly improved accommodation in terms of volume can be obtained as compared to the architectures considered in the companion paper. Because of this property, the proposed lens antennas may be particularly useful in emerging applications requiring an extended field of view.					toso, giovanni/AAL-1704-2021	Toso, Giovanni/0000-0002-0301-5289														2079-9292				MAR	2022	11	5							687	10.3390/electronics11050687	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11050687													WOS:000768114900001

Because of its essential practical significance, it has attracted the attention of many researchers. The key to dynamic network link prediction is to model the network topology evolution and capture time information. Currently, most studies divide dynamic networks into a series of static time snapshots, which can be considered a rough compressed of continuous-time dynamic networks. Such compression will lead to the loss of time evolution information in the window and how to choose the appropriate partition granularity is a considerable challenge. In this paper, we propose a link prediction method for continuous-time networks based on Random Walk and Time Aggregation(RWTA). In the method, we perform random walk with time-constrained directly on a continuous-time network to get node sequence without slicing into time snapshots. Then, based on skip-gram, the initial node representation is gotten, and the dynamic graph with node representation is created. A temporal proximity neighborhood aggregation process is designed to enhance node representation, and the binary operator is done to obtain edge representation. Finally, A classifier is utilized to predict links. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

This problem is conspicuous in intermittent water networks due to their inherent limited supply and service irregularity characteristics. A continuous monitoring of the operating hydraulic parameters of the network combined with accurate critical event detection can vastly reduce the ramifications of the problem. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the trending Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can offer a smart, low-cost, and scalable mechanism to attain such objective. In this paper, we present the initial phase of building a smart wireless system optimized for continuous monitoring of intermittent water distribution network (IWDN). The system design properly exploit the intermittent nature of the water supply in order to optimize the performance of the proposed system and algorithms. We demonstrate the system node and server prototypes and the performance results of the proposed adaptive Kalman filtering burst and 1 eakage detection algorithm using simulated events and real measurement data from a case study of a pilot intermittent supplied district meter area (DMA)in Hurghada, Egypt.

The unit can be configured to implement one of the following five linear generator algorithms: a multiplicative congruential, a mixed congruential, a standard multiple recursive, a mixed multiple recursive, and a multiply-with-carry. The generation unit can be used both as a pseudorandom and a message passing-based server, which is able to produce pseudorandom numbers on demand, sending them to the network-on-chip blocks that originate the service request. The generator architecture has been mapped to a field programmable gate array, and showed that millions of numbers in 32-, 64-, 96-, or 128-bit formats can be produced in tens of milliseconds.

Due to various reasons, such a network may experience substantial workload imbalance. One way to address this challenge relies on government providing higher subsidy to incentivize patients to visit hospitals with low workload/utilization. In this research, we studied the problem of optimal government-to-patient subsidy differential (G2P-SD) policy design. We first formulated the problem with a nonlinear optimization model to minimize the total social cost (i.e., the cost of weighted wait time plus government subsidy spending) subject to the minimum workload requirement. Then we used a discrete choice model with real-world data to identify the significant influence of G2P-SD on patient hospital visit choice and numerically specified the rates of patient arrivals at a multi-hospital outpatient care network accordingly. We next developed a large-scale twolevel queuing network to analyze the impact of G2P-SD on patient flows within the service network. We defined funding efficiency as a potential indicator to policy makers for effective budget allocation among various types of patients. Our study verified the effectiveness of modifying the G2P-SD policy, i.e., the total social cost is reduced by 55.99%. Furthermore, our study suggested the benefit of further tailoring the policy design with consideration of influential patient attributes, which leads to a further reduction in wait time at high-workload hospitals in our Shanghai-based case study.

Due to the overwhelming number of microstructure design variables, traditional approaches to material optimization can have time-consuming processes and limited use cases. Here, we combine a surrogate optical neural network with an inverse neural network and dynamic post-processing to form an aggregated neural network inverse design process. Our surrogate network emulates finite-difference time-domain simulations (FDTD) by developing a relationship between the microstructure's geometry, wavelength, discrete material properties, and the output optical properties. The surrogate optical solver works in tandem with an inverse neural network to predict a microstructure's design properties that will match an input optical spectrum. As opposed to conventional approaches that are constrained by material selection, our network can identify new material properties that best optimize the input spectrum and match the output to an existing material. The output is evaluated using critical design constraints, simulated in FDTD, and used to retrain the surrogate-forming a self-learning loop. The presented framework is applicable to the inverse design of various optical microstructures, and the deep learning-derived approach will allow complex and user-constrained optimization for thermal radiation control in future aerospace and space systems.

Design of a Distribution Network Using Primal-Dual Decomposition	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												A method to solve the design of a distribution network for bottled drinks company is introduced. Thedistribution network proposed includes three stages: manufacturing centers, consolidation centers using cross-docking, and distribution centers. The problem is formulated using a mixed-integer programming model in the deterministic and single period contexts. Because the problem considers several elements in each stage, a direct solution is very complicated. For medium-to-large instances the problem falls into large scale. Based on that, a primal-dual decomposition known as cross decomposition is proposed in this paper. This approach allows exploring simultaneously the primal and dual subproblems of the original problem. A comparison of the direct solution with a mixed-integer lineal programming solver versus the cross decomposition is shown for several randomly generated instances. Results show the good performance of the method proposed.

Detailed Supply Chain Design Considering Production Campaigns	10TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING	Computer-Aided Chemical Engineering				10th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering	AUG 16-20, 2009	Salvador, BRAZIL					Until now, supply chain (SC) design models have been mainly focused on SC integration, where nodes allocation and links among them are selected in order to allow an efficient operation of the whole system. Usually, the detailed configuration and operation of the plants have not been taken into account. In this work, a heuristic strategy is presented in order to design the SC, including the structure and the operation of plants with mixed product campaigns. The incorporation of plant design and mixed product campaign in the SC design model leads to a non linear formulation. Hence, a two stages approach is addressed in order to solve this problem through linear models. In the first stage, a SC design standard model is solved in order to obtain the network design with minimum logistic cost and the production of each selected plant. These results are used to estimate the possible campaigns composition for each plant. In the second stage, specific scheduling constraints are incorporated in the plant design model to determine the optimal mixed product campaign configuration and the structure of each plant, minimizing the investment cost. This methodology allows obtaining the SC logistic configuration and, for each selected plant, the optimal mixed production campaign simultaneously with the plant design, in order to meet a specified economic criterion fulfilling demand requirements.

The aim is to determine the location, size and function of formation yards and the links between them. These decisions affect the routing of transport flows between each origin-destination pair. The presented network design problem has special characteristics and therefore differs in various ways from existing hub location models. A modeling approach, which includes these characteristics, is presented. To the best of our knowledge, there has neither been a consideration of a hub location model for a strategic network design for wagonload traffic nor a simultaneous consideration of different hub types, capacities in hubs and different vehicle types.

J	Sung, T; Lee, HJ				Sung, Thaileang; Lee, Hyo Jong			Removing Snow From a Single Image Using a Residual Frequency Module and Perceptual RaLSGAN	IEEE ACCESS												Removing snow particles from an image is a complicated task due to the particles' shape, size, and color. The latest snow removal methods remove snow from a single image but retain some snow and salt-and-pepper particles. Some approaches, while trying to remove snow from a single image, produce blurry artifacts. In this paper, we solve these problems by designing a network model that consists of a residual generative network, a snow-free image generative network, and a perceptual relativistic discriminative network. In both generative networks, we assign the residual frequency network (ReFNet) as our bottleneck module. Our network model learns to map two relationships. First, the input snowy image is trained to map the snow mask image in the dataset. Then, a retained image resulting from subtraction between an input image and the estimated residual image is concatenated with the input snowy image and mapped to the desired snow-free ground truth. Moreover, we use a perceptual identical-paired adversarial network based on a relativistic discriminative network to make our training results more robust.

To deal with the unknown noise, we design a dynamic quantization scheme that switches between "zooming-in" and "zooming-out", and adjusts a "zooming" parameter of finite-level quantizers. Moreover, a two-stage event-triggering scheme is proposed to determine whether to sample the state and whether to transmit the encoded state information. The joint design of the dynamic quantization scheme and the two-stage event-triggering scheme can well counteract the effects of unknown noise and network delay on the desired ISS of the concerned system. Moreover, the proposed schemes can avoid Zeno behavior and do not require any prior bounds on the unknown noise. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is further verified through simulations.

One advantage of using NNTrees is that they are actually "grayboxes" because they can be interpreted easily if the number of inputs for each ENN is limited. To design interpretable NNTrees, we have proposed a multiple objective optimization based genetic algorithm. This algorithm, however, is good only for solving problems with binary inputs. In this paper, we propose a method to solve problems with continuous inputs. The basic idea is to find a small number of critical points for each continuous input using self-organized learning, and quantize the input using the critical points. Experimental results with several public databases show that the NNTrees built from the quantized data are much more interpretable, and in most cases they are as good as those obtained from the original data.																			2161-4393		0-7803-8359-1				2004							1433	1437																WOS:000224941900249
J	Wang, T; Li, Y; Jia, B; Long, JC				Wang, Ting; Li, Yao; Jia, Bin; Long, Jiancheng			An autonomous vehicle exclusive lane design problem under the mixed autonomy traffic environment: Model formulation and large-scale algorithm design	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW												With the development of self-driving, urban network will face a hybrid stage where both connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist. Due to the ability of CAVs to share information and coordinate in real-time, the design of autonomous vehicle (AV)exclusive lanes has received much attention as it is expected to improve traffic flow characteristics. This study proposes an AV-exclusive lane design problem (ALDP) for the road network. The ALDP is formulated as a bi-level programming model. The upper-level model deploys the optimal design of AV-exclusive lanes to reduce the total comprehensive cost. The lower-level problem describes the mixed routing equilibrium (MRE) travel behavior of CAVs and HDVs. Specifically, CAVs and HDVs follow the user equilibrium principle in general lanes, and CAVs on the exclusive lanes are controlled by the system to adopt the system optimum principle. To deal with largescale scenarios, a heuristic nested algorithm is developed for solving the lower-level MRE traffic assignment problem. Two acceleration strategies, namely the technology-based strategy and the sensitivity analysis-based strategy, are developed to speed up the solution process. Besides, a kriging surrogate-based optimization algorithm is designed to solve the bi-level ALDP. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the nested algorithm achieves high-precision solution with fast computational speed when solving the MRE problem in real-world traffic networks. Additionally, the implementation of the AV-exclusive lanes design scheme significantly improves the overall performance of the network in terms of total system travel time. This study provides new insights into future hybrid phase facility construction and management strategies.																			1366-5545	1878-5794				AUG	2024	188								103534	10.1016/j.tre.2024.103534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2024.103534													WOS:001252349900001
J	Lee, WB; Liao, KC				Lee, WB; Liao, KC			Constructing identity-based cryptosystems for discrete logarithm based cryptosystems	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS												In 1984, Shamir proposed the concept of the Identity-Based (ID-Based) cryptosystem. Instead of generating and publishing a public key for each user, the ID-Based scheme permits each user to choose his name or network address as his public key. This is advantageous to public-key cryptosystems because the public-key verification is so easy and direct. In such a way, a large public-key file is not required. Since new cryptographic schemes always face security challenges and many discrete logarithm-based cryptographic systems have been deployed, therefore, the purpose of this paper is to design a transformation process that can transfer all of the discrete logarithm based cryptosystems, into the ID-based systems rather than re-invent a new system. In addition, no modification of the original discrete logarithm based cryptosystems is necessary. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Input-to-state stability for discrete time-delay systems via the Razumikhin technique	SYSTEMS & CONTROL LETTERS												This paper aims to study the problem of input-to-state stability (ISS) for discrete time-delay systems. By employing the Razumikhin technique and suitable Lyapunov functions, backward and forward Razumikhin-type ISS theorems, that guarantee the global ISS, global asymptotic ISS and global exponential ISS for general discrete time-delay systems are established. Moreover, Razumikhin-type global exponential ISS theorems give the estimation of the convergence speed. As an application, the Razumikhin-type exponential ISS result is used to derive exponential ISS criteria for a class of interconnected discrete systems with coupling time-delays and disturbance inputs.

In order to formalize the state change of the manufacturing quality in the assembly process, the functions, operations, and quality changes in the assembly process are represented as a network model that can simulate discrete events. This paper also develops a design method for the assembly process. The design method calculates the space of quality state change and outputs a better assembly process (better operations and better sequences) that can be used to obtain the intended quality state of the final product. A computational redesigning algorithm of the assembly process that considers the manufacturing quality is developed. The proposed method can be used to design an improved manufacturing process by simulating the quality state change. A prototype system for planning an assembly process is implemented and applied to the design of an auto-breaker assembly process. The result of the design example indicates that the proposed assembly process planning method outputs a better manufacturing scenario based on the simulation of the quality state change.																			1881-3054						2009	3	4					378	389		10.1299/jamdsm.3.378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1299/jamdsm.3.378													WOS:000274935900003

These two approaches each cannot be used to improve an ongoing process and require a great deal of time to generate statistically significant samples. Presented here is a protocol for tracking the interconnection of design process elements as a mixed temporal hypergraph network which may evolve in real time. The protocol utilizes email and limited human reporting data to develop the time-stamped connections of the network. At any time, this network or a filtered subset of it may be subjected to an analysis of graph and network properties. The response of these properties may then be correlated to either events or performance metrics. Here, this approach is applied to emails generated in the course of an undergraduate mechanical engineering senior design project. This application demonstrates an ability to identify member roles, work schedules, and project phase changes from graph and network properties.

On the basis of linear matrix inequality (LMI), a class of fixed PID controller parameters is obtained, and some sufficient conditions for the existence of the GCC are derived. Although the additive gain perturbations are included in the feedback systems, both the stability of closed-loop systems and adequate cost bound are attained. As a sequel, decentralized GCC PID for a class of discrete-time uncertain large-scale stochastic systems is also considered.

Hardware-Efficient DWT Architecture for Image Processing in Visual Sensors Networks	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL												This article proposes a fractional wavelet filter (FrWF)-based 2-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) architecture for the 9/7 Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF) filter employed at the wireless visual sensor nodes (VSNs) for preprocessing of images. Two very large-scale integration (VLSI) architectures of an FrWF-based 2-D DWT for a 9/7 CDF filter are proposed here. The first design employs raster scanning order as the data access scheme and is termed horizontal-FrWF (H-FrWF), whereas the second design employs vertical scanning order as the data access scheme and is termed vertical-FrWF (V-FrWF). The proposed architectures and best of the existing 2-D DWT architectures are modeled in Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL), simulated using Vivado 2019.1, and synthesized using the gpdk090 library by Cadence Genus Synthesis Solution. The implementation results reveal that both the proposed architectures are memory-efficient and significantly improve area and power compared to state-of-the-art designs. The proposed V-FrWF architecture has constant latency, and the dependency of the memory requirement for FrWF computation on the resolution of the image is eliminated. Moreover, the proposed architectures are capable of computing the 2-D DWT of high-resolution (HR) images with high image quality, making them expedient for wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

The objective is the optimal selection of the system components among different technologies, as well as the optimal design of the heat pipeline network to allow heat exchange between different nodes in the neighbourhood. More specifically, this work focuses on the design, interaction and operation of the pipeline network, assuming the operation and maintenance costs. Furthermore, thermal and cold storage, transfer of thermal energy, and pipelines for transfer of cold and hot water to meet domestic hot water demands are additions to previously published models. The application of the final model is investigated for a case-study of a neighbourhood of five houses located in the UK. The scalability of the model is tested by also applying the model to a neighbourhood of ten and twenty houses, respectively. Enabling exchange of thermal power between the neighbours, including for storage pur -poses, and using separate hot and cold pipeline networks reduces the cost and the environmental impact of the resulting DER.

A flexible superstructure that contains all possible alternatives of a potential RO network was developed and was used in the synthesis of RO networks. The networks were designed by using DuPont's B10 Hollow Fiber module. For fixed freshwater demand and quality, the total annualized cost of the RO networks (capital and operating costs) is minimized in order to find the optimal operation and configuration of RO systems for three different feed concentrations and with seasonal variation of seawater temperature. It is found that seasonal variation in seawater temperature has a significant effect on the design and operation of RO systems. Also the results demonstrate that the variation in the number of modules required for the operation of RO process in high and low temperature seasons offers the possibility of flexible scheduling of cleaning and maintenance of membrane modules.

For a cooling water system involving multiple supplies and cooling water using operations, an integrated optimization is presented in which the pump network, cooling water network and cooling tower are designed as a whole system. Mixed-integer nonlinear programming based on a superstructure description is formulated by considering the configuration of the main auxiliary pump, the location of the cooling towers, and the supply mode of cooling water simultaneously. Four operational cases are presented and analyzed in detail for the integrated cooling water system design. In all cases, global optimality is achieved with zero integrality gap, thus indicating that the optimal location and load of each cooling tower along with the optimal configurations of the pump network and the cooling water network are obtained. Relaxation techniques for addressing the nonlinear terms in the model are also presented and good performance in computation speed can be achieved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel framework is adopted to analyze the stability of the concerned systems. Under this framework, two truncated predictor feedback controllers are developed for two classes of discrete-time linear systems with infinite distributed input delays via the low gain method respectively. It is shown that under the designed controllers, those two classes systems are globally exponentially stable.

However, due to the unavailability of material design guides, its mixed design is still based on extensive experimentation, which is a highly uneconomical and time-consuming process. This study aims to develop a machine learning-based model capable of predicting the suitable mix design for ECC. Initially, a dataset of 147 data points composed of mixed design and their associated stress-strain curves was collected from the published literature. This paper uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model incorporating 10 input parameters, including all the ingredients of the mix design and the properties of the fibers utilized to predict the complete tensile stress-strain curve of ECC in terms of the bilinear idealized curve. Furthermore, a detailed sensitivity analysis was also conducted to study the influence of each parameter on the tensile behavior of ECC. This model gives RMSE for a training set of yield stress, yield strain, ultimate stress, and ultimate strain as 0.042, 0.002, 0.36, and 0.3, respectively, while for the testing set, RMSE is 0.2, 0.004, 0.374, 0.3133 and 0.18, respectively. Finally, the model's performance was revalidated experimentally by employing mixes that were not part of previous data. The results show that this model possesses a high accuracy and can help to design ECC without extensive experimentation, which can help in the advancement of the commercialization potential of this robust composite.

The modeling approach adopted aims at the embedding supply chain risks in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design process and suggests optimal supply chain configuration and risk mitigation strategies. Design/methodology/approach - The method proposes a closed-loop supply chain network and identifies the network parameter and variables required for closing the loop. Mixed-integer-linear-programming-based mathematical modeling approach is used to formulate the research problem. The solutions and test results are obtained from CPLEX solver. Findings - The outcomes of the proposed model were demonstrated through a case study conducted in an Indian hospital furniture manufacturing firm. The modern supply chain is mapped to make it closed loop, and potential risks in its supply chain are identified. The supply chain network of the firm is redesigned through embedding risk in the modeling process. It was found that companies can be in great profit if they follow closed-loop practices and simultaneously keep a check on risks as well. The cost of making the supply chain risk averse was found to be insignificant. Practical implications - Although the study was conducted in a practical case situation, the obtained results are not indiscriminate to the other circumstances. However, the approach followed and proposed methodology can be applied to many industries once a firm decides to redesign its supply chain for closing its loop or model under risks. Originality/value - By using the identified CLSC parameters and applying the proposed network design methodology, a firm can design/redesign their supply chain network to counter the risk and accordingly come up with planned mitigation strategies to achieve a certain degree of robustness.

Comparing Child Maltreatment Prevention and Service Delivery at the Community Level of Practice: A Mixed-Methods Network Analysis	HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP & GOVERNANCE												Child maltreatment practice has broadened in recent decades to include prevention strategies, however much remains unknown about how preventive efforts are enacted among organizations at the community level compared to service delivery. Using a mixed-methods design with 67 interviews and 80 network surveys, this study compares interactions among organizations across prevention and service domains. Data suggest that though organizations are active in prevention, and view services as preventative, prevention efforts are substantially less defined, relationships around prevention are less mutually recognized, and prevention occurs in a structure of more dispersed rather than centralized connections. Results are discussed for policy and practice relevance.

J	Sharif, AA				Sharif, Ahlam Ammar			Transfer ethnography: the recording of a heritage building	ARCHNET-IJAR INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to detail an actor-network theory inspired ethnography of recording heritage buildings. The case study focusses on Irbid School in Al Tal area, which is one of the oldest schools in Jordan and an important heritage building. Design/methodology/approach - The recording process was undertaken by third-year architectural design studio students from Philadelphia University. The paper documents the interaction between the heritage building and the students in a two-phased ethnography, including fieldwork conducted between September and December 2017. Findings - The paper proposes the concept of "transfer ethnography", which considers the continuous changes in design across different locations. This extends beyond traditional ethnography, which focusses on a single location. Here, in contrast to the classical viewpoint, following the recording process shows that building design is ongoing and extends beyond implementation through the years as the building ages. Research limitations/implications - Due to the chosen research approach, the research investigated the most relevant events from the author's perspective, which might extend in various ways. Future research is encouraged to investigate more events that support the empirical findings. Practical implications - The paper provides a new angle from which building design networks can be followed through the transfer ethnography, which has implications for the recording and similar processes that necessitate the continuous following of actors. Originality/value - The research suggests the transfer ethnography, which entails close and in-depth engagement with actors but changes with the transformation of a design while following the actors and networks' shifts between the different locations. It is more delicate, attentive and indispensable considering the dynamics of design.					sharif, ahlam ammar/HZL-8420-2023	sharif, ahlam ammar/0000-0001-7538-0966													2631-6862	1938-7806					2020	14	2					289	302		10.1108/ARCH-02-2019-0039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ARCH-02-2019-0039													WOS:000588618100010

The filter algorithm is designed by computing a pair of gains namely the estimator and the coupling. Herein, we implement a filter to estimate unknown parameters such that the closed-loop multi-sensor accomplishes the desired performances of the proposed H-2/H-infinity schemes over a finite horizon. A switched strategy is implemented to switch between the states once the operation conditions have changed due to disturbances.

Design of flexible heat exchanger network for multi-period operation	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Heat exchanger networks (HENs) increase heat recovery from industrial processes by matching hot and cold streams to exchange heat and reducing utility consumption. The design of HENs is a very complex task which generally involves mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP). This work evaluates and critically compares existing HEN design methods. It then presents a systematic methodology in the design of HENs under multiple periods of operation. The model presented in this work is a superstructure-based MINLP model which minimises the total annualised cost containing heat exchanger area cost and utility costs. The model is based on the superstructure by Yee and Grossmann [1990. Simultaneous optimisation models for heat integration-II, heat exchanger network synthesis. Computer & Chemical Engineering 14(10), 1165-1184], which was later formulated for multiple periods by Aaltola [2002. Simultaneous synthesis of flexible heat exchanger network. Applied Thermal Engineering 22, 907-918]. It includes a multi-period simultaneous MINLP model to design the HEN structure, and an NLP model to improve the solution and allow for non-isothermal mixing. Modifications to Aaltola's model include the use of maximum area per period in the area cost calculation of the MINLP objective function, and the removal of slack variables and weighed parameters from the existing NLP improvement model. The new model has been applied to one industrial case study, demonstrating that the new combined MINLP-NLP model can obtain better solutions by not relying on the average area assumption in the MINLP stage.

J	Jafari, N; Hearne, J				Jafari, Nahid; Hearne, John			A new method to solve the fully connected Reserve Network Design Problem	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												In selecting sites for conservation purposes connectivity of habitat is important for allowing species to move freely within a protected area. The aim of the Reserve Network Design Problem is to choose a network of contiguous sites which maximises some conservation objective subject to various constraints. The problem has been solved using both heuristic and exact methods. Heuristic methods can handle much larger problems than exact methods but cannot guarantee an optimal solution. Improvements in both computer power and optimisation algorithms have increased the attractiveness of exact methods. The aim of this work is to formulate an improved algorithm for solving the Reserve Network Design Problem. Based on the concept of the transshipment problem a mixed integer programming model is formulated that achieves contiguity of the selected sites. The model is simpler in concept and to implement than previous exact models and does not require any assumptions about the regular shape of candidate sites. The method easily handles the case where more than one reserve system is required. We illustrate this with an example obtaining the trade-off between the number of contiguous areas and utility.

Grooming Benefits on Designing Elastic Optical Networks: An Exact Formulation	2018 SBFOTON INTERNATIONAL OPTICS AND PHOTONICS CONFERENCE (SBFOTON IOPC)					1st SBFoton International Optics and Photonics Conference (SBFoton IOPC)	OCT 08-10, 2018	Campinas, BRAZIL	IEEE, Brazilian Photon Soc, Keysight Technologies, CPqD, idea Elect Syst, SBFoton				This work proposes a new Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for traffic grooming, routing and spectrum allocation to be used in the design of Elastic Optical Networks (EON). In order to compare our method with classic Routing and Spectrum Allocation (RSA) formulation without grooming, the evaluation of the benefits of exact traffic grooming and RSA formulation are presented over three small networks. For each network, the objective function is set as minimizing the maximum slot index among all fibers. Then, the collected results show the benefits of traffic grooming in EON networks. Due to the NP characteristic of the MILP proposed, we propose a heuristic algorithm for large networks, and the benefits of the grooming using this algorithm are investigated.

Optimizing splitter and fiber location in a multilevel optical FTTH network	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												Due to the emergence of bandwidth-requiring services, telecommunication operators are brought to renew their fixed access network, most of them favoring the Fiber To The Home (FTTH) technology. This paper focuses on the optimization of FTTH deployment, which is of prime importance due to the economic stakes. The key design issue here is locating splitters and routing fibers in an existing network infrastructure to which is associated a graph with given capacities on the edges. No assumption is made on the structure of the graph. First we propose a mixed integer formulation for this decision problem and we prove it is NP-hard. Then, valid inequalities and problem size reduction schemes are presented. Finally, the efficiency of solution approaches is assessed through extensive numerical tests performed on France Telecom-Orange real-life data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A Closed-loop Supply Chain Network Design Problem in Copper Industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING												Undoubtedly, metals are the basis of the sustainable development of all human societies. In the last century, the role of copper, as the third most widely used metal, after steel and aluminum, has been crucial. Copper is a recyclable metal. It has many applications such as industrial electricity, plumping, wiring, electronic equipment, transportation, and infrastructure. Today, with the growth of the industry in societies, the demand for copper has increased. This motivated us to study its supply chain network design firstly. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research reported about copper supply chain network design. This paper aims to maximize the profit of the copper closed-loop supply chain. We formulate this network design problem as a Mixed Integer Programming model. The model is considered as single-objective and multi-product. The exact solution of the model is found by using GAMS software. Sensitivity analysis results provide useful results that managers can use them in decisions.																			1025-2495	1735-9244				OCT	2020	33	10					2008	2015		10.5829/ije.2020.33.10a.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.5829/ije.2020.33.10a.19													WOS:000577178200019

We present a criterion for optimal sampling design under this framework which aims to minimise the error in the prediction of the underlying spatial random effects. The proposed criterion is derived by performing an asymptotic expansion to the conditional prediction variance. We argue that the mean of the spatial process needs to be taken into account in the construction of the predictive design, which we demonstrate through a simulation study where we compare the proposed criterion against the widely used space-filling design. Furthermore, our results are applied to the Norway precipitation data and the rhizoctonia disease data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Jawahar			Design and Optimization of Wideband Microwave Amplifier Using Nonlinear Technique	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS												In this article, a wideband microwave amplifier design adopting negative image synthesis is presented. Various RF and microwave characteristics of the amplifier have been analyzed and simulated. The design approach incorporated nonlinear model of the transistor with Negative Image Synthesis for impedance matching networks at the input and output section of the amplifier. The added strength to the design is the implementation doing away with discrete passive components like chip resistor, capacitor and inductor. The biasing network, matching circuits both input and output sections (IMN, OMN) are all implemented with an optimum number of micro strip transmission lines. The designed amplifier renders an excellent transducer gain (G(T)) of a maximum of 20 dB and a minimum of 10 dB over the designated frequency band of 1-5 GHz with a noise figure (NF) having value lesser than 1 dB. The other parameters such as 1 dB compression point, Third Order Intercept point all exhibit a conformal agreement with the design specifications and tolerance. The input matching network is designed with a minimum NF thereby trading off a paltry value in gain. But the output matching network is optimized to achieve the desired gain, optimizing VSWR. To enhance further the performance of the amplifier, output matching network can be enriched with a defective structure on the ground plane.																			0929-6212	1572-834X				APR	2018	99	4					1589	1604		10.1007/s11277-018-5293-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-018-5293-5													WOS:000428460100010
J	Rahmani, Z; Yaghoubi, S				Rahmani, Zahra; Yaghoubi, Saeed			Adult stem cell donor supply chain network design: a robust optimization approach	SOFT COMPUTING												Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a usual treatment used against cancers and blood diseases. To diminish the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease, donors and recipients should be sufficiently matched in terms of human leukocyte antigen. Iranians' stem cell bank was established to help patients search for their compatible donors. However, in many cases, matched donors are not found in the domestic bank. The low efficiency of the national adult stem cell bank and the expensive cost of adding donors are the main challenges of this study, driving us to design the stem cell donor network for the first time. Initially, using the common weights data envelopment analysis approach, we identified the most efficient donation zones. Afterward, we proposed a mixed-integer programming model in order to design the donor network. Finally, to show the applicability of the model, we provided a real case study of Iran. The results of this study shed light on three important questions: Where should the stem cell donors be attracted from? How many donors does the stem cell bank need to increase the odds of finding a matched donor within the country? And what would be the optimal location and allocation of the donor network facilities?

Tree network design avoiding congestion	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING												We introduce in this paper an optimal method for tree network design avoiding congestion. We see this problem arising in telecommunication and transportation networks as a flow extension of the Steiner problem in directed graphs, thus including as a particular case any alternative approach based on the minimum spanning tree problem. Our multi-commodity formulation is able to cope with the design of centralized computer networks, modern multi-cast multi-party or hub-based transportation trees. The objective in such cases is the minimization of the sum of the fixed (structural) and variable (operational) costs of all the arcs composing an arborescence that links the origin node (switching center, server, station) to every demand node (multi-cast participants, users in general). The nonlinear multi-commodity flow model is solved by a generalized Benders decomposition approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on the ability of fuzzy systems to approximate any nonlinear mapping, the unknown nonlinear system is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. The control problem is then tackled using a feedback linearization of the fuzzy nonlinear system. However, this feedback linearization can not guarantee robustness in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. In order to solve this problem, an additive H. control component is added to the linearizing controller to attenuate uncertainty and disturbance influence on the control performances. In this work, the H. control component is designed in terms of modified Riccati inequality. Finally, an illustrative example is included to demonstrate the feasibility of-the proposed method.																					0-7803-7293-X				2001							765	768																WOS:000178178300190

An optimization approach to design forest road networks and plan timber transportation	OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												The provision of ecosystem services depends on the landscape-level distribution of forest management options over extended planning horizons. Nevertheless, transportation costs are an important fraction of total procurement costs. Therefore, forest managers are challenged by the need to make decisions regarding the design of the road network needed to have access to forest management units (e.g., stands) as well as the transportation of forest products over this network. The objective of this research is to develop an approach to integrate the design and maintenance of a forest roads' network and to provide solutions to the timber loading location site and the timber transportation problems. The emphasis is on the combination of mathematical programming formulations and heuristic solution techniques to minimize the sum of road building, road maintenance, timber loading and transportation costs. Specifically, a mixed integer programming model is built to represent the problem while a heuristic algorithm, based on a Graph Simplification procedure and a big-M Estimation procedure, is proposed to solve the underlying optimization problem. Results from an application to a large-scale forest management problem in Northwest Portugal involving 1137 management units are discussed. Results suggest that this approach may help address efficiently the need by forest managers to integrate road design, road maintenance, timber loading location and transportation concerns.

In the last two decades, SSS has attracted a lot of attention in the European Union, where it is also regarded as a key factor for economic and social cohesion between countries. In this regard, the present study proposes a new network design that aims at improving and increasing freight traffic between the north-western and the south-eastern shores of the Mediterranean Basin. The proposed model, designed for Ro-Ro (Roll-on Roll-off) freight transport, tries to overcome the limits of the existing multi-port-calling services through an innovative two-hub-based scheme of better scheduled and reliable frequencies and more competitive delivery times. The operating parameters of the new network are determined using a specially designed optimisation approach based on two separate but related mathematical models: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming Model for Service Frequency Selection and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming Model for Service Timetabling. Numerical tests, performed on real demand and supply data covering 23 ports in 8 Mediterranean countries, show the validity of the proposed approach to determine an optimal network configuration for the organisation of transport services in the area.

This has led to a growing emphasis on integrating sustainability into supply chain practices. However, there is limited research on incorporating all three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) into supply chain management. This study presents a mixed-integer linear programming model for designing an uncertain supply chain network design that aims to minimize overall costs (establishment, production, and transportation/routing costs) while considering carbon emissions and a few social factors simultaneously. The study considers sustainable aspects of decision-making process and utilizes chance-constrained programming to address uncertainties. The proposed model attempts to maintain balanced flow levels across all stages of the network, optimizing the utilization of raw materials and production. The proposed optimization model is a cost minimization model that also tries to minimize greenhouse gas emissions throughout the entire network. A greedy based heuristic is provided for dealing with larger instances of the given decision making problem.

Value-added services that consider the network effect can significantly affect customers' consumption decisions. Meanwhile, they can infiltrate the main products and promote the profits of enterprises. As an effective sales strategy, bundling has become a new approach for enterprises to provide products and services. We investigate the optimal pricing and market share, as well as the maximum profits of products and services under pure and mixed bundling strategies, respectively, in the case of negative network effects for both products and services. Based on the multinomial logit model, we theoretically analyze the optimal solution and profit difference under pure and mixed bundling strategies. The results show that, considering the negative network effect, the profit functions of the pure and mixed bundling strategies are concave functions vis-`a-vis the market share, and closed solutions of optimal pricing and market share, as well as maximum profits are obtained. Finally, the numerical simulation shows the profit difference between pure and mixed bundling strategies when the network effect changes. The research results can provide a theoretical basis and decision-making support for products and services pricing strategies.																			0360-8352	1879-0550				AUG	2022	170								108328	10.1016/j.cie.2022.108328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.108328		JUN 2022											WOS:000841096600002

In particular, we propose two different variations, one based on a cascade of multiple CRFs, the other on a unified graphical model. By designing a novel CNN implementation of mean-field updates for continuous CRFs, we show that both proposed models can be regarded as sequential deep networks and that training can be performed end-to-end. Through extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and establish new state of the art results on publicly available datasets.

To solve the problem, the paper presents a mixed integer linear program model. The proposed model incorporates several relevant constraints, such as weekly frequency, the transshipment of cargo between two or more service routes, and transport time. Extensive numerical experiments based on realistic date of Asia-Europe-Oceania shipping operations show that the proposed model can solve real-case problems efficiently by CPLEX. The results demonstrate that the model can reduce ship's capacity consumption and raise ships' capacity utilization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, empirical studies indicate controversial results of the effect of SLA tools on student engagement. This design-based research designs a student-facing SLA tool to demonstrate discussions from three perspectives and further uses mixed methods to investigate the effects of the tool. Results indicate the tools have positive influences on increasing student social-cognitive engagement. The social network visualization has positive influences on both socially active and inactive students; it particularly increases peripheral students' social engagement. The topic network visualization improves all students' perspective expressions, indicating that demonstrating students' interested topics may increase cognitive engagement. The cognitive network visualization triggers students' information sharing, which is considered as the beginning of online engagement development. Based on the results, this research proposes integrated implications by considering learning theory, pedagogical supports and tool development.

J	GERSHT, A; WEIHMAYER, R				GERSHT, A; WEIHMAYER, R			JOINT OPTIMIZATION OF DATA NETWORK DESIGN AND FACILITY SELECTION	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS												The goal of optimal network design and facility engineering is to arrive at network topologies that minimize total network cost while selecting facility types, allocating capacity, and routing traffic to accommodate demand and performance requirements. This problem is characterized by large dimensionality, even when relatively small networks are considered. This paper describes a data network design model based on a Mixed Integer/Linear Programming (MILO) formulation that does not, as do most other approaches, separate link capacity and facility selection from routing and topological design; it fully integrates these processes to capture the very important couplings that exist between them. The performance constraints are incorporated into the model in such a way that they are linear but lead to the same grade of service for a balanced network as a nonlinear average network delay constraint. We show that our formulation leads to a natural decompostion of the optimal design problem into two subproblems solvable sequentially. In the absence of capacity allocation constraints, the capacity and flow assignment problem is solved optimally and efficiently as part of the overall design process. Moreover, the model leads directly to the solution of multifacility design problems. We present a fast link reduction algorithm that efficiently designs single or multifacility networks and yields robust local extrema. This algorithm is based on a special-purpose monotonic greedy drop heuristic procedure. One important application of this model is the design of multifacility networks, e.g., networks in the early stages of fiberoptic penetration, where other facility types necessarily coexist. Our numerical results show that economies-of-scale lead to the appearance of fiber-optic highways within the network as traffic grows. The numerical results also demonstrate the flexibility and computational efficiency of the algorithm, with particular emphasis on multifacility network design and planning.																			0733-8716					DEC	1990	8	9					1667	1681		10.1109/49.62854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/49.62854													WOS:A1990EP74000005

Coordinated dual-homing in designing hierarchical wireless access network with a genetic algorithm based approach	TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS												With the growth of mobile users and the increasing deployment of wireless access network infrastructures, the issue of fault tolerance is becoming an important component of efficient wireless access network design. In this work, we study a survivable hierarchical network design problem. Given the available capacity, connectivity, and reliability at each level, the problem is to minimize overall connection cost for multiple requests such that the capacity, connectivity, and minimum survivability constraints are not violated. Our study is different than earlier research in regard to the coordination of multiple layers of access networks. The connectivity to the core network may be fully or partially dual-homed paths, or may be single-homed paths. Dual-homing schemes spanning to different levels in the network hierarchy are used if the single-homed connectivity is not enough to guarantee the minimum required survivability. We formulate the problem using mixed integer linear programming and prove the complexity class to be NP-hard. We then propose an off-line genetic algorithm based meta-heuristic. Given the complexity of the problem, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is viable in designing fault-tolerant access networks with dual-homing capability.																			1018-4864	1572-9451				DEC	2013	54	4					417	431		10.1007/s11235-013-9741-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11235-013-9741-y													WOS:000327143500004

The accuracy of the present flatness pattern recognition is limited and the shape defects cannot be reflected intuitively. In order to improve it, a novel method via T-S cloud inference network optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. T-S cloud inference network is constructed with T-S fuzzy neural network and the cloud model. So, the rapid of fuzzy logic and the uncertainty of cloud model for processing data are both taken into account. What's more, GA possesses good parallel design structure and global optimization characteristics. Compared with the simulation recognition results of traditional BP Algorithm, GA is more accurate and effective. Moreover, virtual reality technology is introduced into the field of shape control by LabVIEW, MATLAB mixed programming. And virtual flatness pattern recognition interface is designed. Therefore, the data of engineering analysis and the actual model are combined with each other, and the shape defects could be seen more lively and intuitively.																			2095-2899	2227-5223				FEB	2015	22	2					560	566		10.1007/s11771-015-2556-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11771-015-2556-0													WOS:000349913400021

The problem is to find an optimal clustering of traffic demands in the network such that the total number of node assignments (and, hence, add-drop multiplexer equipment requirements) is minimized, while satisfying the ring capacity and node cardinality constraints. This problem can be conceptualized as an edge-capacitated graph partitioning problem with node cardinality constraints. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer programming model and develop a new branch-and-cut algorithm along with preprocessing routines for optimally solving the problem. We also prescribe an effective heuristic procedure. Promising computational results are obtained using the proposed method.

Photoinduced transformations of stiff-stilbene-based discrete metallacycles to metallosupramolecular polymers	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Control over structural transformations in supramolecular entities by external stimuli is critical for the development of adaptable and functional soft materials. Herein, we have designed and synthesized a dipyridyl donor containing a central Z-configured stiff-stilbene unit that self-assembles in the presence of two 180 degrees di-Pt(II) acceptors to produce size-controllable discrete organoplatinum(II) metallacycles with high efficiency by means of the directional-bonding approach. These discrete metallacycles undergo transformation into extended metallosupramolecular polymers upon the conformational switching of the dipyridyl ligand from Z-configured (0 degrees) to E-configured (180 degrees) when photoirradiated. This transformation is accompanied by interesting morphological changes at nanoscopic length scales. The discrete metallacycles aggregate to spherical nanoparticles that evolve into long nanofibers upon polymer formation. These fibers can be reversibly converted to cyclic oligomers by changing the wavelength of irradiation, which reintroduces Z-configured building blocks owing to the reversible nature of stiff-stilbene photoisomerization. The design strategy defined here represents a novel self-assembly pathway to deliver advanced supramolecular assemblies by means of photocontrol.

We propose an information-theoretic constructive scheme for obtaining an achievable rate region in such networks. Many well-known capacity-defining achievable rate regions can be derived as special cases of the proposed scheme. A few such examples are the physically degraded and reversely degraded relay channels, the Gaussian multiple-access channel, and the Gaussian broadcast channel. The proposed scheme also leads to inner bounds for the multicast and allcast capacities. Applying the proposed scheme to a specific wireless network of n nodes located in a region of unit area, we show that a transport capacity of Theta (n) bit-meters per second (bit-meters/s) is feasible in a certain family of networks, as compared to the best possible transport capacity of Theta(rootn) bit-meters/s in [16], where the receiver capabilities were limited. Even though the improvement is shown for a specific class of networks, a clear implication is that designing and employing more sophisticated multiuser coding schemes can provide sizable gains in at least some large wireless networks.																			0018-9448	1557-9654				AUG	2003	49	8					1877	1894		10.1109/TIT.2003.814480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2003.814480													WOS:000184250500001

The establishment of these networks requires the satisfaction of quality criteria for material properties deemed significant by an industry. It also necessitates cooperation among the different firms based on the satisfaction of individual cost or resource consumption goals. Furthermore, there may be varying degrees of incomplete information regarding the process data of the participating plants. Eco-industrial RCNs may also be topologically constrained with respect to the number of links connecting different plants. These design aspects are incorporated in the optimization model through fuzzy mixed integer linear programming (FMILP) or fuzzy mixed integer non-linear programming (FMINLP).

Although hub-and-spoke paradigm demonstrates significant advantages in improving network connectivity with less number of routes and saving operating cost, the failure of hubs and reactive disruption management could lead to substantial recovery cost to the operators. Thus, we propose a set of reliable huband-spoke network design models, where the selection of backup hubs and alternative routes are taken into consideration to proactively handle hub disruptions. To solve these nonlinear mixed integer formulations for reliable network design problems, Lagrangian relaxation and Branch-and-Bound methods are developed to efficiently obtain optimal solutions. Numerical experiments are conducted with respect to real data to demonstrate algorithm performance and to show that the resulting hub-and-spoke networks are more resilient to hub unavailability.

For the last 20 years, there has been an increasing number of publications regarding how to design such fixed routes (services), to ensure a high level of service while minimizing operational costs and environmental impact. The liner shipping network design problem can briefly be described as follows: Given a set of demands (defined by origin, destination, time limit) and a set of vessels with variable capacity, the task is to design a set of weekly services, assign vessels to the services, and flow the demand through the resulting network such that it arrives within the stated time constraints. The objective is to maximize revenue of transported demand subtracting the operational costs. We present an in-depth literature overview of existing models and solution methods for liner shipping network design, and discuss the four main families of solution methods: integrated mixed integer programming models; two-stage algorithms designing services in the first step and flowing containers in the second step; two-stage algorithms first flowing containers and then designing services; and finally algorithms for selecting a subset of proposed candidate services. We end the presentation by comparing the performance of leading algorithms using the public LINER-LIB instances. The paper is concluded by discussing future trends in liner shipping, indicating directions for future research. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To do so, various conflicting objectives and constraints are simultaneously taken into account in the presence of some uncertain parameters, such as cost coefficients and customer demands. Then, we propose a novel interactive possibilistic approach based on the well-known STEP method to solve the multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model. To validate the presented model and solution method, a numerical test is accomplished through the application of the proposed possibilistic-STEM algorithm. The computational results demonstrate suitability of the presented model and solution method.

This paper proposes a model for integrated logistics network design to avoid the sub-optimality caused by a separate, sequential design of forward and reverse logistics networks. First, a bi-objective mixed integer programming formulation is developed to minimize the total costs and maximize the responsiveness of a logistics network. To find the set of non-dominated solutions, an efficient multi-objective memetic algorithm is developed. The proposed solution algorithm uses a new dynamic search strategy by employing three different local searches. To assess the quality of the novel solution approach, the quality of its Pareto-optimal solutions is compared to those generated by an existing powerful multi-objective genetic algorithm from the recent literature and to exact solutions obtained by a commercial solver.

Despite to several papers proposed on the design and applications of two-dimensional constrained lens antennas, and in particular on the Rotman-Turner lens, a rigorous study focused on the minimization of optical aberrations does not seem to be available. The main results of a general procedure for the design of two-dimensional bootlace lens antennas with a flat front profile are proposed in this paper. It will be shown that the best performance is achievable when, in addition to the three nominal focal points, two additional symmetric quasi foci are present. It will be shown also that a completely different two-dimensional discrete lens, characterized again by a flat profile and 4 focal points, presents minimized aberrations when the presence of one additional quasi focus on the lens axis is guaranteed. Interestingly, both the 3- and 4-foci lenses, when optimized, converge to the same configuration which exhibits aberrations following a Chebyshev-like behavior and guarantees quasi 5 foci.					toso, giovanni/AAL-1704-2021														1554-8422		978-1-6654-4166-7				2022										10.1109/PAST49659.2022.9975081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PAST49659.2022.9975081													WOS:000922930700119

The proposed model considers a broad facility network linking production and distribution facilities located internationally. The proposed model discussed in the paper assumes significance over the traditional manufacturing model as it provides a country specific analysis making it more convenient for the decision maker to devise country specific strategies within an international ecosystem. Therefore, the model considers import export cost, loan subsidies along with depreciation expense and other operating costs applicable to specific country. The objective of the model is to identify optimal facility locations and the production distribution in the entire network to meet the demand of global markets.

Firstly, neural networks (NN) are employed to approximate the uncer-tain nonlinear functions. Next, the average molecular weight and the reactor temperature tracking controllers are designed based on the finite-time NN-BFTSMC. In addition, the NN-BFSMC effectively estimates and compensates the upper bounds of the external disturbances. Moreover, the chattering effect is eliminated without losing the robustness accuracy.

And we design two optimal nonlinear mixed integer programming schemes to investigate the optimal robustness and analyze the characteristic parameters of different schemes. In this paper, we can obtain the optimal values of the corresponding parameters of optimal designs, and we find that coefficient of variation is a better measure than 2-norm degree and two-step degree to study the robustness of scale-free networks. Meanwhile, we discover that there is a tradeoff among the robustness, the degree, and the cost of scale-free networks, and we find that when average degree equals 6, this point is a tradeoff point between the robustness and cost of scale-free networks.																			1058-9244	1875-919X					2016	2016								5659687	10.1155/2016/5659687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/5659687													WOS:000381132000001

Bioethanol production especially from different biomass such as wheat straw has been specified as one of the sustainable solutions to deal with energy crisis. Bioethanol logistics network optimization will reduce total costs of supply chain management and improves its competency with fossil fuels. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to integrate and optimize bioethanol logistics network design problem. The proposed model is a multi-period and multi-echelon including feedstock supply centers, collection centers, bio-refineries, and customer centers.

To reduce costs and optimize the distribution network, we construct a mixed integer programming model that comprehensively considers to minimize fixed, transportation, fresh-keeping, time, carbon emissions, and performance incentive costs. We analyzed the performance of traditional rider distribution and robot distribution modes in detail. In addition, the uncertainty of the actual market demand poses a huge threat to the stability of the terminal distribution network. In order to resist uncertain interference, we further extend the model to a robust counterpart form. The results of the simulation show that the instability of random parameters will lead to an increase in the cost. Compared with the traditional rider distribution mode, the robot distribution mode can save 12.7% on logistics costs, and the distribution efficiency is higher. Our research can provide support for the design of planning schemes for transportation enterprise managers.																			1526-1492	1526-1506					2024	138	1					719	738		10.32604/cmes.2023.028699	http://dx.doi.org/10.32604/cmes.2023.028699													WOS:001117644600018

However, the continuous and discontinuous deformation simulation of rock masses directly based on digital images is still challenging. Based on the Numerical Manifold Method (NMM), a simple and efficient image-based simulation method is developed for rock masses containing complex fracture networks. A new crack model, named as "voxel crack model," is generated based on pixel values of the digital image and a user-defined resolution. With the voxel crack model, physical cover and manifold elements in NMM are then efficiently generated for complex fracture networks. After this, the continuous and discontinuous displacement fields of rock masses are simulated straightforwardly. In the present work, conventionally burdensome tasks, like boundary detections to transform digital images into computer aided design (CAD) models, generating conforming meshes, and explicitly tracking of fracture surfaces, are avoided. Several benchmarks validate the developed method. The calculated continuous and discontinuous deformation field of the San Leo rock slope containing a complex fracture network demonstrates the capability of the proposed method for practical engineering application.

However, it lacks the specific attention enhancement mechanism in the training process, and is difficult to be applied to the speed transfer fault diagnosis under unbalanced training sample condition. Considering these challenges, a neural network called discrete-peak joint attention enhancement (DPJAE) convolutional model is proposed. First, the proposed discrete channel attention enhancement method is applied to enhance the characteristic discreteness of convolutional neural network channels. Then, the peak channel attention enhancement method follows, which is employed to enhance feature peaks in convolutional neural network channels. Finally, the discrete-peak joint attention enhancement method is placed in the middle of a well-designed robust CNN architecture to enhance the discreteness and peak value for channel characteristics. In order to avoid the over-fitting phenomenon of high variance in the training process of the deep network model, L2 regularization method is introduced to regularize the weights for the front layer network. The diagnosis results on the open test dataset show that the DPJAE model not only gets high accuracy in the unbalanced training samples, but also achieves high performance in the rotating speed transfer testing samples. The proposed method is also verified on the private dataset. Compared with other diagnostic methods, the method has better diagnostic results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The design is based on the concept of algebraic connectivity of the interaction graph. When viewed as a function of the network state, the algebraic connectivity is not continuously differentiable, a fact neglected in previous controller designs. To illustrate the importance of this observation, we present an example of a simple multi-robot system that fails to maintain connectivity under such controllers. The insights gained allow us to synthesize an optimization-based controller that prescribes that all the nontrivial eigenvalues of the Laplacian remain positive. Using tools from nonsmooth analysis and set-valued theory, we show that the proposed controller is continuous, thereby guaranteeing the existence of the robot trajectories for the closed-loop system and ensuring network connectivity is maintained along them.

The methodology is based on four interconnected/nested networks. The first network is derived by identifying a set of thermodynamic states providing a basis for feasible separation alternatives. In this network, the nodes correspond to multiple saturation points, solute intermediates, and process feeds and end products. The second network type represents the variety of tasks that can be performed at each multiple saturation point. These tasks include cooling crystallization, evaporative crystallization, reactive crystallization, dissolution, and leaching. Heat integration is incorporated using the transshipment formulation to represent the heat exchanger network. The fourth network represents the filtration and cake washing alternatives. The cake wash and task networks are modeled using disjunctive programming and then converted into a mixed-integer program. The method is applied to the design of three salt separation example problems. The optimal design costs are seen to depend on design parameters such as product impurity level and liquid retention in the cake. The advantage of an integrated synthesis approach is demonstrated.

Fast convergence is especially important in wireless networks which are dominated by the dynamics of incoming and outgoing flows as well as the time sensitive applications. Yet, the design of fast converging policies in wireless networks is complicated by: (i) the interference-constrained communication capabilities, and (ii) the finite set of transmission rates to select from due to operational and physical-layer constraints. We tackle these challenges by explicitly incorporating such discrete constraints to understand their impact on the convergence speed at which the running average of the received service rates and the network utility converges to their limits. In particular, we establish a fundamental fact that the convergence speed of any feasible policy cannot be faster than Omega (1/T) under both the rate and utility metrics. Then, we develop an algorithm that achieves this optimal convergence speed in both metrics. We also show that the well-known dual algorithm can achieve the optimal convergence speed in terms of its utility value. These results reveal the interesting fact that the convergence speed of rates and utilities in wireless networks is dominated by the discrete choices of scheduling and transmission rates, which also implies that the use of higher-order flow rate controllers with fast convergence guarantees cannot overcome the aforementioned fundamental limitation.																			0743-166X		978-1-4673-5946-7				2013							2112	2120																WOS:000326335202027

Firstly, we present the dynamic model description studied, in which the discrete-time fuzzy T-S systems with packet loss can be described by one class of fuzzy Markovian jump systems. Then, the concepts of stochastic finite-time stability and stochastic finite-time boundedness and problem formulation are given. Based on Lyapunov function approach, sufficient conditions on stochastic finite-time stability and stochastic finite-time boundedness are established for the resulting closed-loop fuzzy discrete-time system with Markovian jumps, and state-feedback controllers are designed to ensure stochastic finite-time stability and stochastic finite-time boundedness of the class of fuzzy systems. The stochastic finite-time stability and stochastic finite-time boundedness criteria can be tackled in the form of linear matrix inequalities with a fixed parameter. As an auxiliary result, we also give sufficient conditions on the stochastic stability of the class of fuzzy T-S systems with packet loss. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to show the validity of the developed methodology.

It is well known that, in current implementations, CAN has been widely used in the control system design of automotive powertrains. However, on the other hand, the application of CAN would not only lead to network-induced delays but also bring about protocol constrains, e.g., data package capability and utilization ratio limitation, which would deteriorate the system and make the controller design a challenging problem. This paper is to provide a co-design methodology that can cope with all these problems and ensure satisfactory control effect for the speed synchronization control of IMT powertrain systems. First, a networked IMT powertrain system using CAN as underlying network is presented and the dynamic model for the speed synchronization control is derived. Second, the network-induced delay model is introduced and improved considering data packet capability and utilization ratio limitation. The control-orient discrete-time model is also derived based on the improved delay model. Third, a co-design methodology using sliding mode controller and offline priority scheduling based on Lyapunov stability criterion is proposed. The results of simulations and tests show the effectiveness of the proposed co-design methodology.

We refer to this configuration as a feedback network. To reflect practical reality, a cost function is considered to constrain the controller. Then based on the master stability function method, the constrained controller design problem is transformed into a mixed- integer nonlinear optimization problem. In addition, when a single controller can not be found under the constraint, a switching controller is designed by a Lyapunov function method. The convex combination technique is used to design the synchronizing switching signal between the candidate controllers, and its coefficients are given by the solution of a convex optimization problem. We also provide a feasible way to construct the candidate controllers, and give a numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

However, when designing IDS models using distributed data collected by UAVs, it is crucial to ensure the security and privacy of the data. Moreover, most IDS models only focus on one-time learning and lack continuous learning capabilities. To address this, we present a Federated Continuous Learning framework with a Stacked Broad Learning System (FCL-SBLS) that utilizes Digital Twin Network (DTN) to enable quick and continuous learning on new data. To enhance the efficiency and quality of the IDS model during training and aggregation, we adopt an asynchronous federated learning architecture. Additionally, we introduce a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based UAV selection scheme assisted by DTN to aid in global IDS model aggregation. This approach ensures that the IDS model can effectively and efficiently learn from distributed data while preserving the privacy and security of the data.The presented algorithm is validated using the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, and the simulation results reveal that our algorithm achieves higher efficiency and accuracy than the existing FL scheme.																			2334-0983	2576-6813	979-8-3503-1090-0				2023							5372	5377		10.1109/GLOBECOM54140.2023.10436983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM54140.2023.10436983													WOS:001178562005153

Obtaining the optimal signal detection algorithm under these scenarios requires the estimate of the mixed Gaussian-impulsive noise parameters. Unfortunately, the estimation accuracy will deteriorate in the presence of the transmitted signal. To solve the problem, we propose a blind source separation method with a neural network, namely U-net++, to separate the transmitted signal from the mixed noise. Then, the parameter estimation can be implemented with the recovered noise samples. An adaptive clipping preprocessing module and a novel loss function of the network are designed based on the statistical property of the mixed noise. Results show that our algorithm outperforms existing baselines on both source separation and parameter estimation.																			2577-2465		979-8-3503-2928-5				2023										10.1109/VTC2023-Fall60731.2023.10333782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VTC2023-Fall60731.2023.10333782													WOS:001133762500373

This paper presents the translation of the DN into analogue Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI). With extensive simulation, the dynamic ranges of parameters and their representation in VLSI are identified. The VLSI circuits realising the stochastic unit of the DN are further designed and interconnected to form a stochastic system using noise to induce stochastic dynamics in VLSI. The circuit simulation demonstrate that the VLSI translation of the DN is satisfactory and the DN system is capable of using noise-induced stochastic dynamics to regenerate various types of continuous-time sequences.																			2161-4393		978-1-4244-6917-8				2010																								WOS:000287421400116

The joint design of balanced energy consumption among member nodes and network lifetimes prolonging can be achieved by employing clustering techniques in such networks. In classical clustering techniques, clustering and in-cluster data rate allocation are usually established as independent items. Although separate considerations of these two items can simplify the networking design, it is often the non-optimal performances for wireless sensor networks. This paper proposes an integral framework, in which these two correlated items are integrated as an interactive entirety. For that, we develop the clustering problems using mixed integer nonlinear programming. The evolutionary process of clustering is provided in simulations. Results validate that our joint-design proposal reaches a near optimal match between member nodes and cluster heads.																			2161-2927		978-988-15638-1-1				2012							6503	6507																WOS:000393905906110

The MSI is relevant for the analysis of and controller design for cyber-physical, embedded and networked systems, since it gives a limit on the time span between sampling instants such that stability is guaranteed. We propose tools to compute the MSI for a given controller and to design a controller with a preferably large MSI, both directly from a finite-length, noise-corrupted state-input trajectory of the system. We follow two distinct approaches for stability analysis, one taking a robust control perspective and the other a switched systems perspective on the aperiodically sampled system.

Tinker is targeted at applications that require real-time assignment of semantic meaning to data, rather than just data storage. Tinker lets users write simple programs, as if they were manipulating individual scalar values, and simulates those computations over continuous streams of sensor data. Tinker does not require (or allow) users to specify details such as routing algorithms or retransmission policies, freeing system designers to rapidly iterate among different broad designs before fleshing out details of the one that looks most promising. We demonstrate Tinker's use in the design and deployment of ElevatorNet, our distributed sensor application that retrofits buildings with per-floor displays of an elevator's position, determined using barometric altimetry.

We provide a conceptual framework that describes a firm's network structure along three dimensions: market focus, plant focus, and network dispersion. Normalized dependent variables are specified that act as proxies for a company's placement into our conceptual network classification via the calculation of just a few key independent variables. We provide robust equation sets for eight cost structure clusters. Many different product types could be classified into one of these groups, which would allow managers to use the equations directly without needing to run the MIP for themselves. Our numerical tests suggest that the formulas representing the network structure driverseconomies of scale, complexity costs, transportation costs, and tariffsmay be sufficient for managers to design their strategic network structures, and perhaps more importantly, to monitor them over time to detect potential need for adjustment.

Based on discrete time Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, a sufficient delay-dependent condition for asymptotic stability of nonlinear systems is offered. Then, this condition is used to design a new efficient delayed state feedback controller (DSFC) for stabilization of such systems. These conditions are in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework. Illustrative examples confirm the improvement of the proposed approach over the similar cases. Furthermore, the obtained stability and stabilization conditions will be extended to uncertain discrete time delayed systems (UDTDS) with polytopic parameter uncertainties and also with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties.					vasegh, nastaran/AAB-1920-2019	vasegh, nastaran/0000-0003-1087-6789													2095-2899	2227-5223				OCT	2014	21	10					3769	3776		10.1007/s11771-014-2361-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11771-014-2361-1													WOS:000343919200008

Water network synthesis using mutation-enhanced particle swarm optimization	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												Different techniques for the synthesis of industrial water reuse/recycle networks have been developed in recent process integration research. These tools range from graphical pinch analysis approaches to mathematical programming models. The latter have the advantage of being flexible enough to incorporate various water network constraints, but in many cases these are often non-linear, thus making the identification of global optima difficult. Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), for finding good solutions these problems. This work describes the use of a modified PSO for solving mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) models for water network synthesis. By incorporating a mutation operator for the binary variables in the model, the algorithm is able to escape sub-optimal network topologies and proceed towards better solutions than can be found with ordinary PSO. Two case studies involving water recycle/reuse are used to demonstrate the new design methodology.					Foo, Ir Dr Dominic C. Y./O-6335-2019	Foo, Ir Dr Dominic C.

It steers the incident signals to create a favorable propagation environment by controlling the reconfigurable passive elements with less hardware cost and lower power consumption. In this paper, we consider a RIS-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output downlink communication system. We aim to maximize the weighted sum-rate of all users by joint optimizing the active beamforming at the access point and the passive beamforming vector of the RIS elements. Unlike most existing works, we consider the more practical situation with the discrete phase shifts and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Specifically, for the situation that the discrete phase shifts and perfect CSI are considered, we first develop a deep quantization neural network (DQNN) to simultaneously design the active and passive beamforming while most reported works design them alternatively. Then, we propose an improved structure (I-DQNN) based on DQNN to simplify the parameters decision process when the control bits of each RIS element are greater than 1 bit. Finally, we extend the two proposed DQNN-based algorithms to the case that the discrete phase shifts and imperfect CSI are considered simultaneously. Our simulation results show that the two DQNN-based algorithms have better performance than traditional algorithms in the perfect CSI case, and are also more robust in the imperfect CSI case.

It consists of making strategic decisions on the facility location, stocking location, production policy, production capacity, distribution and transportation modes. This research develops a hybrid optimization approach to address the Supply Chain Configuration Design problem. The new approach combines simulation, mixed integer programming and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The PSO provides a mechanism to optimize qualitative and policy variables. The mixed integer-programming model reduces computing efforts by manipulating quantitative variables. Finally simulation is used to evaluate performance of each supply chain configuration with non-linear, complex relationships and under more realistic assumptions. The approach is designed to be robust and could handle the large scale of the real world problems.																					7-81118-023-5				2006							954	957																WOS:000242373900230
J	Zhong, J; Ho, DWC; Lu, JQ				Zhong, Jie; Ho, Daniel W. C.; Lu, Jianquan			A New Approach to Pinning Control of Boolean Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL OF NETWORK SYSTEMS												Boolean networks (BNs) are discrete-time systems, where nodes are interconnected (here, we call such connection rule among nodes as a network structure), and the dynamics of each gene node is determined by logical functions. In this article, we propose a new approach on pinning control design for global stabilization of BNs based on BNs' network structure, named as network-structure-based distributed pinning control. Compared with the existing literature, the design of pinning control is not based on the state transition matrix of BNs. Hence, the computational complexity in this article is reduced from O(2(2n)) to O(n(2) + n2(kappa)), where n is the number of nodes and K <= n is the largest number of in-neighbors of nodes. In addition, without using the state transition matrix, global state information is no longer needed; the design of pinning control is just based on neighbors' local information, which is easier to implement. The proposed method is well demonstrated by several biological networks with different sizes. The results are shown to be simple and concise, while the traditional pinning control cannot be applied for BNs with such a large dimension.

While NC offers several benefits for P2P content distribution, the coding operations at the network nodes introduce a delay that is detrimental for low-delay communications. To this end, we designed a push-based packet scheduling mechanism devised to minimize the communication delay. Furthermore, our protocol is designed around a low computational complexity class of rateless codes that enable us to experiment on real networks where the nodes have limited computational capabilities. That enables us to experiment with two typical low-delay applications such as live video streaming and videoconferencing in a realistic network scenario. The experiments show that our protocol enables continuous playback with limited initial delay and we point out the issues that NC poses in low-delay applications.

At the same time, the existing literature features a limited number of studies which consider fortification of facilities for improving network reliability. In this paper, we develop a reliable uncapacitated fixed-charge location model with fortification to support the design of distribution networks. The model considers heterogeneous facility failure probabilities, one layer of supplier backup, and facility fortification within a finite budget. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer programming model which is proved to be NP-hard. We develop a Lagrangian relaxation-based (LR) heuristic solution algorithm and demonstrate its computational efficiency for solving large-scale problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Initially, a novel multilayer NN model that removes the one-to-one interlayer coupling constraint and introduces nonidentical model parameters is first established to meet diverse modeling requirements in complex applications. To help the multilayer target NNs with mismatched connection coefficients and time delays achieve synchronization, the hybrid controller is designed using intralayer-dependent impulsive control and switched feedback control approaches. Furthermore, the mode-mixed effects caused by the intralayer coupling delays and switched intralayer topologies are incorporated into the novel model and analysis method to ensure that the subsystems operating within the current switching interval can effectively use the topology information of the previous switching intervals. Then, a novel analysis framework including super-Laplacian matrix, augmented matrix, and mode-mixed methods is developed to derive the synchronization results. Finally, the main results are verified via the numerical simulation with secure communication.

As deficient rural logistics network has restricted the rural development to a certain extent, this research field becomes a hot topic. However, most existing papers on forward and reverse logistics network design were primarily concerned with minimizing the total cost, neglecting the time sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a rural forward and reverse logistics network mode of e-commerce platform and a multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming model for logistics network design. To solve the NP-hard problem of the model, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) has been used. At last, the model has been used to design forward and reverse rural logistics network in Pinggu district of Beijing as an example, and the result show that the model is efficient for establishing virtuous rural logistics network.																					978-1-5090-6119-8				2016							316	321		10.1109/ICEBE.2016.22	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICEBE.2016.22													WOS:000392693800049

The genetic algorithm seeks to improve design by a process of selection and recombination within a population of designs proceeding generation-by-generation. The problem of 'combinatorial explosion' caused by the combination of many discrete values of the design variables can be resolved by a process of progressive combinatorial space condensation[6]. The application takes place on-line under adaptive controls with initial values specified by the designer. The temporary suspension of design activity while the structure is reanalysed is time-consuming since each change in the design variables requires a fresh analysis of the structure. A more economical process would obtain if a reanalysis tool capable of automatically accommodating all changes in design data were available during the optimization process. If the structure has a mole-or-less standard form such as a rectangular multi-storey frame or a structural grillage then a neural network is ideally suited to this purpose. In these circumstances it is a simple matter to train a network to map input variables to output (design) quantities. The resulting reanalysis tool is then suitable for integration into a total design process.																					0-948749-55-5				1998							221	227																WOS:000077305500026

We present novel models with a new reading of the problem. Indeed, some classical models in literature seem in certain cases simplistic and then generate gaps between theoretical formalisms and the reality. Concretely, these gaps arise when setting up and calibrating these models, thus the identification of robust parameter values could prove difficult. The reason is the aggregation process of data, since it is naturally used in modeling, lacks to provide sufficient accuracy. In a pragmatic framework, the issue of logistic network design is rich and presents several possibilities for data apprehension in terms of details to be modeled. This motivates to construct a more realistic modeling approach. In this context, we propose a way for integrating a maximum precision degree without leaving the context of modeling a strategic issue. Actually, the question of designing a logistic network is substituted by the need to compute a logistic master plan mixing the tactical with the strategic. This becomes a major concern of businesses and this observation fits the importance of location-allocation problems. Two mixed integer programming (MILP) are proposed. A derived linear programming (LP) is identified and used to describe a perspective of a cooperative hybrid resolution approach based on Genetic Algorithm. Experimental study provides a comparison of the models results.

Traditional protocols queue management and congestion can't cope with the traffic management of high density and non-linear load, which can lead to congestion that causes a decrease in the effective data rate and degrades quality parameters, such as the percentage of packet loss, delay, and delay variation. Most often in data networks is using a passive mechanism of droping the packets when the queue is become full. When sending TCP traffic, this mechanism leads to the appearance the phenomenon of global synchronization. In order to early prevention of queue overflow, have been developed mechanisms for early detection congestion. This article describes the principles of building a simulation model for active queue management algorithms. The algorithms and program listings performing discrete-event simulation. These algorithms are used to perform simulation using high-level languages. Increasing complexity of modern telecommunication technologies creates a problem in the application of analytical techniques to evaluate the performance of designed systems and networks, and causes extensive use of simulation. In this paper in order to control congestion the nodes packet-switched networks using active queue management algorithms. The relevant service system, which simulates the work of a network node, each incoming packet can be dropped with a certain probability, even if the buffer is not yet fully filled. Probability of dropping depends on the length of the queue at the time of income the package.

As a means to widen the real-world applicability over the existing network design studies, a backbone node not opened is allowed to be included in the backbone tree for transhipment purpose. The problem is modelled as a mixed 0-1 integer programming, whose special structure is exploited for the development of a dual-based lower bounding procedure. The procedure is incorporated in the branch and bound solution method, whose effectiveness is well demonstrated by the computational experiments conducted with a variety of problems ranging up to 50 backbone nodes and 200 demand points.

We investigate whether this performance gain through network coding carries over to the military tactical data network with its unique military requirements. In our study, we design network coding transmission algorithms that are tailored to tactical data network requirements, and compare the performance of several algorithms in user mission environments. We use discrete event simulation to evaluate the performance gains of these algorithms, based on metrics that are suitable for the military users. We demonstrate that network coding can alleviate the problem of low reliability in some types of military wireless networks. Our conclusion is that a proper application of network coding can enhance military user communications in operational environments, and we recommend appropriate use of network coding to military users.																			2155-7578		978-1-4244-2676-8				2008							470	475																WOS:000266709300072

The control system is designed on the basis of the discrete Lyapunov theory which assure the system reaches sliding mode manifolds. The equivalent control is used directly as the control input after reaching sliding mod manifolds. A part of equivalent control is estimated by an on-line estimator, which is realized by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) algorithm is improved and used to train the RNN. Due to its real-time learning ability, the stability of control system are guaranteed. The proposed control scheme eliminates chattering and provides sliding mode motion on the selected manifolds in the state space. The detailed control procedure is given and numerical examples are used to validate the proposed control scheme.																			1062-922X		0-7803-4778-1				1998							1726	1731																WOS:000077033700303

Herein, a highly stretchable and sensitive strain sensor based on binary rubber blend/graphene was fabricated by a simple and effective assembly approach. A novel double-interconnected network composed of compactly continuous graphene conductive networks was designed and constructed using the composites, thereby resulting in an ultralow percolation threshold of 0.3 vol%, approximately 12-fold lower than that of the conventional graphene-based composites with a homogeneously dispersed morphology (4.0 vol%). Near the percolation threshold, the sensors could be stretched in excess of 100% applied strain, and exhibited a high stretchability, sensitivity ( gauge factor similar to 82.5) and good reproducibility (similar to 300 cycles) of up to 100% strain under cyclic tensile tests. The proposed strategy provides a novel effective approach for constructing a double-interconnected conductive network using polymer composites, and is very competitive for developing and designing high performance strain sensors.																			2050-7526	2050-7534					2016	4	26					6345	6352		10.1039/c6tc01925k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tc01925k													WOS:000379492900020

In this article we characterize network resources in terms of capacity, utilization, and efficiency, and define these metrics as functions of the sets of constraints under which the network is operating. These constraints may include service level agreement objectives, routing policy constraints, and failure survivability requirements. Constraint-based network characterization allows a network operator to quantify the inherent capacity of a network and determine the impact of changes in operating conditions on realizable capacity. It also helps assess how well a given network design matches the set of constraints under which it is operating, how much traffic growth the network can support, and what actions need to be taken to accommodate traffic growth.																			0163-6804					SEP	2005	43	9					132	138		10.1109/MCOM.2005.1509978	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2005.1509978													WOS:000232948700012

J	Tran, PN; Killat, U				Tran, Phuong Nga; Killat, Ulrich			Resource efficient logical topology design for IP-over-WDM backbone networks	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS												With the advancements in WDM technology to provide huge capacity and the Internet Protocol playing a dominant role in networking technology, IP-over-WDM network becomes a potential candidate for next generation networks. This article studies the problem of designing logical topologies for IP-over-WDM backbone networks. One important feature of IP-over-WDM networks is the reconfigurability when traffic demands change over time. If the network resource is not used efficiently, the reconfiguration can cause network disruption because no new wavelength channels (lightpaths) can be added before deleting some working channels. Moreover, more than one logical topology for different services or from different ISPs can be simultaneously implemented in an existing WDM network. Hence using resources efficiently is an important issue while designing logical topologies. In this article, we present a new approach to design logical topologies so that the network resource is used most efficiently while the network performance is guaranteed. The problem is formulated as an MILP problem. Since this MILP problem is NP-hard and can be applied for small networks only, a heuristic algorithm based on iterative optimization is proposed to solve the problem for real-size networks.

Moreover, Non -terrestrial networks (NTN) introduce dynamic changes in the types of connected devices as base stations or access points are moving objects. Therefore, continuous network capacity design is required to fulfill the network requirements of each device. However, continuous optimization of network capacity design for each device within a short time span becomes difficult because of the heavy calculation amount. We introduce device types as groups of devices whose traffic characteristics resemble and optimize network capacity per device type for efficient network capacity design. This paper proposes a method to classify device types by analyzing only encrypted traffic behavior without using payload and packets of specific protocols. In the first stage, general device types, such as IoT and non-IoT, are classified by analyzing packet header statistics using machine learning. Then, in the second stage, connected devices classified as IoT in the first stage are classified into IoT device types, by analyzing a time series of traffic behavior using deep learning. We demonstrate that the proposed method classifies device types by analyzing traffic datasets and outperforms the existing IoT-only device classification methods in terms of the number of types and the accuracy. In addition, the proposed model performs comparable as a state-of-the-art model of traffic classification, ResNet 1D model. The proposed method is suitable to grasp device types in terms of traffic characteristics toward efficient network capacity design in networks where massive devices for various services are connected and the connected devices continuously change.																			0916-8516	1745-1345				JAN	2024	E107B	1					117	125		10.1587/transcom.2023WWP0004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1587/transcom.2023WWP0004													WOS:001176197200002

Pure wireless message passing as well as mixed wireless and wireline message passing are considered in this paper. We study the distributed optimization of sum-rate for a class of deterministic interference networks with local view. A connection based utility function is designed for each user to exploit the local knowledge. This utility design turns out to be a potential game with sum-rate as the potential function. For the one-to-many channel with 1.5 wireless rounds of message passing, we show that there is a unique Nash equilibrium and using this strategy, the sum capacity can be achieved. We provide a sufficient condition for which a topology does not have unique Nash equilibrium. Then we consider the scenario that the network size and the users IDs are provided to each user. For various mixed wireless and wireline message passing patterns, including wireline at transmitter/receiver side and sequential/concurrent message passing scheduling, we identify whether a three-user interference network can achieve the sum capacity in a distributed fashion. Compared with the 1.5 pure wireless rounds of message passing, the results show that 2.5 mixed wireless and wireline rounds of message passing can significantly improve the system performance of three-user interference networks. We also derive some sufficient conditions for general K-user interference networks such that the sum capacity can not be achieved based on each user's local view.					; Aggarwal, Vaneet/A-4843-2017	LIU, YOUJIAN/0000-0003-4681-0546; Aggarwal, Vaneet/0000-0001-9131-4723													2474-0195		978-1-4244-5870-7				2009							1195	+		10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394535	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394535													WOS:000279627100163

This paper focuses on the leader-follower resilient consensus of continuous-time heterogeneous multiagent systems against Byzantine attacks on nodes. Considering the excessive communication burden in practice, a distributed dynamic event-triggered mechanism is devised to enable intermittent communication among agents. Building upon this mechanism, two protocols are applied to achieve the output consensus when the leader converges to dynamic and static states, respectively. The latter protocol can decrease both communication data and the frequency of event triggers when the leader converges to a static state. In addition, the output regulation control for uncertain system dynamics is achieved by utilizing the technique of internal model principle. Moreover, the designed event-triggered mechanism can be employed to the networks with bounded communication delays. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed protocols is demonstrated by some numerical simulations.

In general, dynamical properties of NCS and non-NCS are different and understood as degradation of the system. Mainly, the considerations concern on the estimating of the degradation degree of the NCS with linear time-invariant components (plant, actuator, sensor, controller) in respect to non-NCS realization of the same system. It is shown that the problem can be reduced to analysis of the nonstationarity degree of NCS. The degradation degree is calculated in frequency domain using SVD-DFT transformation of system operator defined on finite time horizon. The method enables to make a quantitative comparison of different control strategies, under given probability of packet dropouts, time delays, etc. Theoretical considerations of computational algorithms are complemented with numerical examples.

A framework for railway transit network design with first-mile shared autonomous vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												Providing a railway transit system (RTS) in less populated areas is a challenging task for transportation agencies due to its high construction and operating costs. With the advent of automation, shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as an integral part of public transit services has the potential to enhance the design of transit systems. In this paper, we present a joint optimization framework of railway transit network design and SAV first-mile service that minimizes the total cost of the combined RTS-SAV services and commuters' waiting time, while serving a dynamic travel demand in the network. The proposed model optimizes the SAV fleet size and the RTS alignment while enabling vehicle relocations to tackle the vehicle imbalance issue in the SAV service. Due to the non-linear and mixed-integer formulation, we develop a fixed-point algorithm for this joint RTS-SAV problem where we transform the original problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Our results indicate that the joint RTS-SAV services can be constructed and operated at a lower cost than either of the RTS or SAV services alone. Furthermore, the resulting joint RTS-SAV services are underpinned by a shorter railway alignment and larger fleet size rather than a multi-link extension. Additionally, the joint RTS-SAV services is robust to the variation in total demand, with respect to the railway alignment, SAV utilization and commuters' waiting time.

This is achieved through considering the effect of components interdependencies and offering guaranteed lead times. An analytical model is presented in this paper, which is supported by discrete event simulation model in order to investigate the effect of material interdependency on the reduction to safety stock allocation. A case example from lead acid battery manufacturing supply chain network is used to demonstrate the applicability of the models. The results, by applying design structure matrix (DSM), showed that less material interdependency reduces the safety stock allocation significantly. The material interdependencies are reduced through clustering operation. The results also showed that reduction of material interdependency reduces the unnecessary investment in inventory management. The difference between the presented analytical model and the discrete event simulation is not significant, which also validate the proposed modeling approach.

Predicting strength development of RMSM using ultrasonic pulse velocity and artificial neural network	COMPUTERS AND CONCRETE												Ready-mixed soil material, known as a kind of controlled low-strength material, is a new way of soil cement combination. It can be used as backfill materials. In this paper, artificial neural network and nonlinear regression approach were applied to predict the compressive strength of ready-mixed soil material containing Portland cement, slag, sand, and soil in mixture. The data used for analyzing were obtained from our testing program. In the experiment, we carried out a mix design with three proportions of sand to soil (e. g., 6: 4, 5: 5, and 4: 6). In addition, blast furnace slag partially replaced cement to improve workability, whereas the water-to-binder ratio was fixed. Testing was conducted on samples to estimate its engineering properties as per ASTM such as flowability, strength, and pulse velocity. Based on testing data, the empirical pulse velocity-strength correlation was established by regression method. Next, three topologies of neural network were developed to predict the strength, namely ANN-I, ANN-II, and ANN-III. The first two models are back-propagation feed-forward networks, and the other one is radial basis neural network. The results show that the compressive strength of ready-mixed soil material can be well-predicted from neural networks. Among all currently proposed neural network models, the ANN-I gives the best prediction because it is closest to the actual strength. Moreover, considering combination of pulse velocity and other factors, viz. curing time, and material contents in mixture, the proposed neural networks offer better evaluation than interpolated from pulse velocity only.

The fault of each sensor or actuator happens in a random way, which is described by an individual random variable satisfying a certain probabilistic distribution. Using these stochastic variables in the system model, new type of NCSs fault model is proposed. The merit of the proposed fault model lies in its generalization and reality, which can cover some existing fault models as special cases. By using Lyapunov functional method and linear matrix inequality technology, sufficient conditions for the mean square stable (MSS) of the NCSs can be obtained. Then the reliable controller can be designed. Finally, a numerical example and a practical example are given to demonstrate the efficiency and application of the proposed method.					peng, chen/HHS-8720-2022	peng, chen/0000-0003-3652-2233; Gu, Zhou/0000-0002-0342-1658													1598-6446	2005-4092				APR	2012	10	2					444	448		10.1007/s12555-012-0225-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12555-012-0225-8													WOS:000302195400025

This paper relates to the resolution of the mutual exclusion problem for discrete event systems modeled with a Network of Timed Event Graphs (NTEGs). It aims to propose formal approaches based on Min-Plus algebra formalisms for the synthesis of control laws to guarantee mutual exclusion constraints in NTEGs. In these studies, the behavior of the network is described by a set of linear Min Plus equations and mutual exclusion specifications are represented by inequalities that are also linear in Min-Plus algebra. Computed laws are modeled by control places which are connected to the initial NTEGs in order to prevent the violation of mutual exclusion constraints.(c) 2021 European Control Association.

J	Yolmeh, A; Saif, U				Yolmeh, Abdolmajid; Saif, Ullah			Closed-loop supply chain network design integrated with assembly and disassembly line balancing under uncertainty: an enhanced decomposition approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH												In recent years, environmental concerns have increased the need for design and optimisation of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) networks. Majority of the existing research papers consider the CLSC network designing and line balancing decisions separately. However, this approach may lead to sub-optimal designs due to the interdependency of these decisions. To this end, this paper investigates a CLSC network designing problem integrated with assembly and disassembly line balancing under demand and return uncertainty. The proposed CLSC network contains manufacturers, remanufacturers, assembly centres, intermediate centres (where disassembly lines are located), and customer centres. A new mixed integer non-linear programming model for the proposed problem is developed. Furthermore, an enhanced decomposition approach is developed to solve the proposed model. Computational results, based on randomly generated problem instances, show the efficiency of proposed enhanced decomposition approach. Specifically, results shows that the proposed enhanced decomposition approach leads to significantly smaller running times in comparison with an existing decomposition approach. Results also highlight the importance of integrating supply chain network designing and line balancing decisions.

Meanwhile, in developing countries, designing an appropriate biofuel supply chain network regarding environmental competencies is an important problem. This paper presents a new bi-objective mixed integer mathematical model aiming to minimize CO2 emission and total costs in the process of the biofuel supply chain, creating a suitable green supply chain network. In this respect, CO2 emission and biofuel demand are regarded as uncertain data to address the real complex cases. Moreover, the SAUGMECON approach was implemented to construct a single objective model, and the obtained Pareto optimal points were depicted and analyzed. Thereby, a robust possibilistic programming approach was implemented to the proposed model to handle existing imprecise data. Furthermore, the applicability and performance of the proposed model were demonstrated based on an experimental example. In this respect, the obtained results from the proposed robust possibilistic programming model were compared with its crisp form to show the robustness and reliability of the proposed uncertain mathematical model.

Fixed-time synchronization means that synchronization can be achieved in a fixed time for any initial values of the considered systems. In the light of the double-layer structure of MBAMNNs, we design two similar feedback controllers. Based on Lyapunov stability theories, several criteria are established to guarantee that the drive and response MBAMNNs can realize synchronization in a fixed time. In particular, by changing the parameters of controllers, this fixed time can be adjusted to some desired value in advance, irrespective of the initial values of MBAMNNs.

The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is applied to approximate the considered nonlinear networked control systems. The perturbations are also considered in the peak-to-peak filter to be designed. Unlike most work about the peak-to-peak filtering for dynamic systems with quantization, both the performance output signal and measurement output signal are quantized by two different dynamic quantizers in our work. The main attention is to design the nonfragile peak-to-peak filter which guarantees the filtering error system to be asymptotically stable and possess a peak-to-peak performance index. By employing the fuzzy basis-dependent Lyapunov function approach and the S-procedure, new sufficient conditions about designing the nonfragile peak to-peak filter have been established, which are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities.

In the dynamic deployment problem model of this paper, not only the coverage rate of WSN but also the moving distance of mobile nodes is taken into consideration. This kind of model can be abstracted into multi-objective optimization problem, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is introduced to solve this problem. In this paper, combined with previous work, an improved dynamic deployment method is proposed based on multi-swarm PSO. Specifically, we propose a discrete PSO to calculate the distance of mobile solutions, and a multi-swarm PSO is designed to optimize network performance for enhancing the QoS of deployment which includes higher coverage rate and lower energy consumption of mobile nodes.

An output-based discrete event-triggering mechanism is introduced to choose those only necessary sampled-data packets to be transmitted through a communication network for controller design.

Finite-Horizon Optimal Adaptive Neural Network Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Discrete-time Systems	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTELLIGENT CONTROL (ISIC)	IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control				IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control (ISIC) held as Part of 7th IEEE Multi-Conference on Systems and Control	AUG 28-30, 2013	Hyderabad, INDIA	IEEE, Indian Inst Technol, IEEE Control Syst Soc, GE				In this paper, finite-horizon optimal control design for affine nonlinear discrete-time systems with totally unknown system dynamics is presented. First, a novel neural network (NN)-based identifier is utilized to learn the control coefficient matrix. This identifier is used together with the action-critic-based scheme to learn the time-varying solution, or referred to as value function, of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in an online and forward in time manner. To handle the time varying nature of the value function, NNs with constant weights and time-varying activation functions are considered. To satisfy the terminal constraint, an additional term is added to the novel updating law. The uniformly ultimately boundedness of the closed-loop system is demonstrated by using standard Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation results.																					978-1-4799-1562-0				2013							41	46																WOS:000345787500003

The nonlinear system is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system, and a network-induced delay is incorporated in the modeling of the connection link. In order to compensate for the network link effects and eliminate the tracking error, we employ some techniques mainly used in the predictive control and the integral control. Moreover, a quadratic cost function which includes terms related to the performance of the system and the actuating capacity is used. We assume that the lumped network-induced delay lies within a known set, and that the occurrence probability for each element in the set is known a priori. Then, the delay information will be incorporated into the delay-dependent tracking controllers. The parameters for the tracking controller are derived by solving an optimization problem. A networked inverted pendulum is used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed design method.

In order to improve the reliability and quality of the communication signal transmission services, redundant channel transmission is utilized to model the communication measurement. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a set of distributed state estimators such that the dynamics of the estimation errors are asymptotically stable in mean square. By using matrix computation and stochastic analysis approaches, a sufficient condition is established to ensure the desired performance requirements, and the explicit form of estimation parameter can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities.

For complex products such as integrated circuit wafers, several types of defects are usually coupled in a piece of wafer to form a mixed-type defect, which poses a challenge to current defect detection methods. This paper proposed a knowledge augmented broad learning system with a knowledge module and broad selective sampling module, which provides a multichannel selective sampling network to decouple the mixed-type defects. In this model, each channel is equipped with a pre-trained deformable convolution model to extract the feature of a fixed single-type defect. The knowledge module is designed to activate the candidate network channel by pre-detection of wafer maps. The experiment results indicated that the proposed model outperforms conventional models and other deep learning models, which demonstrated that the knowledge augmented broad selective sampling mechanism is effective for mixed-type defect detection.

The model optimizes the design and utilization of a network with integrated heating/cooling pipelines and micro-grid connections between neighborhoods, in two case studies of five and ten houses, respectively. This work explores the use of feed-in tariffs, renewable heat incentives and the ability to buy and sell from and to the national grid. Depending on the scenario it is shown that DER networks mitigate around 30-40% of the CO2 emissions per household, compared with 'traditional generation', in which all the electricity comes from the national grid, the heating and domestic hot water are provided by gas boilers and air-conditioning units provide space cooling. Moreover, money from feed-in tariffs, renewable heat incentives and sales to the grid, as well as reduced grid purchases, make the DER networks more economical, and more profitable (approximately 100 per year per household), compared with the traditional energy system.

The models are generated using a hybrid neural networks/discrete particle swarm optimization technique. Such models capture the essence of a piece of music, capable of generating new music sequences. The degree of similarity of the new sequence to the original piece can be controlled by adjusting fitness parameters. A collection of models can be used to represent different sections of one piece or different styles of music. A discrete version of particle swarm optimization was used to manipulate various neural network design parameters, including the lag structure of the input and output variables, the number of hidden nodes, the presence/absence of a linear component, and smooth morphing from univariate to multivariate networks, in order to find the best structure corresponding to the highest fitness of step-ahead predictions against actual data.																					978-0-7803-9487-2				2006							2043	2049																WOS:000245414203052

Supply Chain Network Design and Tactical Planning in the Dimension Stone Industry	OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												A dimension stone supply chain has certain unique characteristics despite having many similarities to a typical manufacturing/processing industry supply chain. Examples of these characteristics include the multitude of dimension stone varieties dispersed over large geographical regions, variable raw dimension stone sizes due to the varying rock deposit quality, and variability in physical stone properties among different varieties. The hardness, texture, fracture, cleavage, and chemical composition vary between dimension stones of different varieties. These unique characteristics produce multidimensional complexity in modelling different processes from the rock excavation stage to the retail store stage. In this research, a dimension stone supply chain is analyzed from strategic and tactical perspectives that address the issues of supply chain network design and production planning. This research reflects the specific characteristics of a dimension stone supply chain that differentiate it from other mineral commodity supply chains. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) based formulation is proposed to model the capacitated facility location problem to aid in the supply chain network design, and a linear programming-based model is proposed to address material transformation related supply chain process issues to facilitate medium-term tactical planning. Detailed numerical analyses are also presented to illustrate the proposed mathematical models.																			1979-3561	2579-9363					2020	13	4					320	335		10.31387/oscm0430273	http://dx.doi.org/10.31387/oscm0430273													WOS:000551239600001

This superfamily-wide analysis indicates a decomposition of the RNase tertiary structure into spatially distributed yet physically connected networks of co-evolving amino acids, termed sectors. Comparison of this statistics-based description with new NMR experiments data shows that discrete amino acid networks, termed sectors, control the tuning of distinct functional properties in different enzyme homologs. Further, experimental characterization of evolutionarily distant sequences reveals that sequence variation at sector positions can distinguish homologs with a conserved dynamic pattern and optimal catalytic activity from those with altered dynamics and diminished catalytic activities. Taken together, these results provide important insights into the mechanistic design of the ptRNase superfamily, and presents a structural basis for evolutionary tuning of function in functionally diverse enzyme homologs.

First, the networked closed-loop system is modeled as a discrete-time linear system with a time-varying delay, whose upper bound can be regarded as not only the admissible maximum delays induced by the network but also the admissible maximum number of packet dropouts between any two consecutive updating instants of ZOH. Then, in order to obtain a larger upper bound of the time-varying delay, a generalized finite-sum inequality is introduced, based on which, a less conservative stability condition is derived by incorporating with convex combination technique. By using the cone complementary linearization approach, the desired output feedback controllers can be designed by solving a nonlinear minimization problem subject to a set of linear matrix inequalities.

An up-coming and especially biocompatible realization are Networked Labs-on-Chips (NLoCs). In NLoCs, small volumes of reagents, so-called droplets, flow in an immiscible fluid in closed channels. An external pump applies a force to this immiscible fluid driving the droplets through the channels of the NLoC. However, the exact flow behavior of droplets in NLoCs physically depends on many factors and interdependencies. This makes it cumbersome to manually determine the taken path of a droplet and the time it needs to pass the NLoC. For the same reason, also almost no automated design solutions exist for NLoCs yet. In this work, we present a discrete model enabling designers and design automation tools to efficiently determine the droplets' path and positions.

Regarding used tires, the effect on human health and the environment is a matter of great concern for urban authorities. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the recovery process for discarded tires. In particular, we study a Reverse Supply Chain Network Design (RSCND), which is designed according to three fundamental echelons (i.e. waste collection, processing and customer zones). To this end, the simultaneous application of simulation techniques and optimization algorithms is proposed. Both approaches are framed within a general methodology, which has been taken from the Operations Research literature. We present a case study from a Colombian city. The combined algorithmic approaches, which include discrete simulation and multiobjective optimization, provide sufficient evidence regarding ways to optimally manage fleet size in the RSCND. Experimental results indicate that the discarded tire recovery process can be designed to be more profitable, as well as less environmentally harmful.

J	Masnadi-Shirazi, MA; Aleshams, M				Masnadi-Shirazi, MA; Aleshams, M			Laguerre discrete-time filter design	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING												The design of discrete-time ideal filters by finite impulse response (FIR) method requires long FIR filter structures. This is due to the infinite impulse response characteristics of the ideal filters. Optimum Laguerre filter structures with smaller length can be used instead of FIR filters to reduce the order of the filters. In this paper the method of designing optimum Laguerre ideal low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, and band-reject filters is introduced. The optimization is performed by evaluating the Laguerre parameter and coefficients when the mean-square-error between the frequency response of the desired filter and its corresponding Laguerre network frequency response is minimum. The problem with the Laguerre filter design is the complexity of computations for evaluating the optimum Laguerre parameter. This complexity is reduced to one half by introducing a lemma. Both, analytical and numerical solutions are presented and the results are illustrated via some examples. The corresponding results yield a reduced filter order, and appropriate linear phase, with lower ripples in stop-band and pass-band compared to the conventional FIR filters.

J	Prékopa, A; Unuvar, M				Prekopa, Andras; Unuvar, Merve			Single Commodity Stochastic Network Design Under Probabilistic Constraint with Discrete Random Variables	OPERATIONS RESEARCH												Single commodity networks are considered, where demands at the nodes are random. The problem is to find minimum cost optimal built in capacities at the nodes and arcs subject to the constraint that all demands should be met on a prescribed probability level (reliability constraint) and some deterministic constraints should be satisfied. The reliability constraint is formulated in terms of the Gale-Hoffman feasibility inequalities, but their number is reduced by elimination technique. The concept of a p-efficient point is used in a smart way to convert and then relax the problem into an LP. The p-efficient points are simultaneously generated with the solution of the LP. The joint distribution of the demands is used to obtain the p-efficient points for all stochastic inequalities that were not eliminated and the solution of a multiple choice knapsack problem is used to generate p-efficient points. The model can be applied to planning in interconnected power systems, flood control networks, design of shelter and road capacities in evacuation, parking lot capacities, financial networks, cloud computing system design, etc. Numerical examples are presented.																			0030-364X					NOV-DEC	2015	63	6					1512	1527		10.1287/opre.2015.1434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2015.1434													WOS:000367833500018

Differential evolution algorithm for optimal design of water distribution networks	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												Water distribution networks are considered as the most important entity in the urban infrastructure system and need huge investment for construction. The inherent problem associated with cost optimisation in the design of water distribution networks is due to the nonlinear relationship between flow and head loss and availability of the discrete nature of pipe sizes. in the last few decades, many researchers focused on several stochastic methods of optimisation algorithms. The present paper is focused on the Differential Evolution algorithm (henceforth referred to as DE) and utilises a similar concept as the genetic algorithm to achieve a goal of optimisation of the specified objective function. A simulation-optimisation model is developed in which the optimization is done by DE. Four well-known benchmark networks were taken for application of the DE algorithm to optimise pipe size and rehabilitation of the water distribution network. The findings of the present study reveal that DE is a good alternative to the genetic algorithm and other heuristic approaches for optimal sizing of water distribution pipes.

Dialogue may be beneficial to the robot to increase the flexibility and facility of the interaction. Traditional robots have merely dealt with simple queries like commands, but in conversation people often omit some words because of the background knowledge or the context of the conversation. Since environments contain various uncertainties, managing the context of a dialogue or the uncertainties should be necessary to support smarter service robots. In order to establish a natural communication between people and robots, we have been investigating the use of mixed-initiative interaction that prompts for missing concepts and clarifies for spurious concepts. Hierarchically designed Bayesian networks are presented for the mixed-initiative interaction. A simulation and a real robot are. constructed for the demonstration of the proposed method, and experiments also show the usefulness.

Therefore, an appealing idea is to expand the width of HSIs by using widely covered multispectral images (MSIs), called spectral super-resolution (SSR) of MSIs. According to the radiation transmission process of the imaging system, the spectral mixing characteristics of ground objects can be described by the linear spectral mixing model (LSMM). Inspired by the linear mixed part and nonlinear residual part of the LSMM, we propose a double-branch SSR network. To generate wide HSIs, a spectral mixing branch is designed to extract abundances from wide MSIs and adaptively learn hyperspectral endmembers from narrow HSIs. Furthermore, considering the nonlinear factors in the imaging system and atmospheric transmission, a nonlinear residual branch is built to complement the spectral and spatial details. Finally, the SSR result can be obtained with the fusion of linear and nonlinear features. To make the network structure achieve corresponding physical significance, we constrain the network through joint loss functions at different stages. In addition to two simulated datasets with limited coverage, our model is also evaluated on a real MSI-HSI dataset in a larger area. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed model compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we visualized the internal results of our network and conducted ablation experiments on a single branch to further demonstrate its effectiveness. In the end, the influence of network hyperparameters, including endmembers and loss function weight coefficient, is discussed and analyzed in detail.

This kind of recurrent neural networks is based on an error-integral design equation and does not need training in advance. The IRNN can achieve global convergence performance and strong robustness if odd-monotonically increasing activation functions [i.e., the linear, bipolar-sigmoid, power, or sigmoid-power activation functions (SP-AFs)] are applied. Specifically, if linear or bipolar-sigmoid activation functions are applied, the IRNN possess exponential convergence performance. The IRNN has finite-time convergence property by using power activation function. To obtain faster convergence performance and finite-time convergence property, an SP-AF is designed. Furthermore, by using the discretization method, the discrete IRNN model and its convergence analysis are also presented. Practical application to robot manipulator and computer simulation results with using different activation functions and design parameters have verified the effectiveness, stability, and reliability of the proposed IRNN.

The method is derived from the dual heuristic dynamic programming (DHP) technique. The challenge caused by saturating actuators is overcome by using a nonquadratic performance index. Then, the event-based control technique is used to decrease the amount of computation. Meanwhile, the stability analysis is provided. It illustrates that the proposed event-based method can asymptotically stabilize the nonaffine systems by using the Lyapunov method. Furthermore, the stability conditions and the design process of the event-based controller are established. The event-based DHP algorithm is implemented by constructing three neural networks, namely, the model network, the critic network, and the action network. Finally, simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the applicability and the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This is achieved by stabilizing the lanes around their nominal situations where the risk to generate congestion is very low. Firstly, by using the store and forward approach, the system is modeled as a linear discrete time model with additive uncertainties. Then, a state feedback traffic light control law that stabilizes the lanes while satisfying the constraints on both state and control variables is established. In order to estimate the uncertainties that may cause bad effects on the control performance, an observer is proposed to achieve this objective.

Considering the case where a dynamical network cannot achieve the synchronization by itself, the feedback controllers are added to drive the network toward a desired orbit. To further decrease both the frequency of controller update and the energy consumption, an intermittent pinning strategy is developed to control only a small part of the network nodes. The purpose of the addressed synchronization control problem is to design a set of feedback controllers such that the closed-loop system achieves both the prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level and the variance constraints. By resorting to a combination of the Lyapunov stability theory and the switching system approach, a sufficient condition is obtained under which the dynamical network reaches the overall synchronization. Furthermore, the expected gains of the intermittent pinning controllers are parameterized by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is exploited to verify the effectiveness of our proposed theoretical results.																			1561-8625	1934-6093				JAN	2022	24	1					111	124		10.1002/asjc.2458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asjc.2458		DEC 2020											WOS:000596490800001

Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Models and Algorithms for Large-Scale Supply Chain Design with Stochastic Inventory Management	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												An important challenge for most chemical companies is, to simultaneously consider inventory optimization and supply chain network design under demand uncertainty. This leads to a problem that requires integrating a stochastic inventory model with the supply chain network design model. This problem can be formulated as a large-scale combinatorial optimization model that includes nonlinear terms. Since these models are very difficult to solve. they require exploiting their properties and developing special solution techniques to reduce the computational effort. In this work, we analyze the properties of the basic model and develop solution techniques for a joint Supply chain network design and inventory management model for a given product. The model is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. By reformulating it as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and using an associated convex relaxation model for initialization. we first propose a heuristic method to quickly obtain good-quality solutions. Further. a decomposition algorithm based on Lagrangean relaxation is developed for obtaining global or near-global optimal solutions.

However, leaving the guarantee of legality to an inexplicable neural network could be problematic in several applications. In this paper, we propose DiffPattern to generate reliable layout patterns. DiffPattern introduces a novel diverse topology generation method via a discrete diffusion model with compute-efficiently lossless layout pattern representation. Then a white-box pattern assessment is utilized to generate legal patterns given desired design rules. Our experiments on several benchmark settings show that DiffPattern significantly outperforms existing baselines and is capable of synthesizing reliable layout patterns.

In DTSL systems, an linear optimal filter with multiple packet losses is designed based on the orthogonal principle analysis approach over unreliable wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the experience result verifies feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed linear filter; in DTSN systems, an extended minimum variance filter with multiple packet losses is derived, and the filter is extended to the nonlinear case by the first order Taylor series approximation, which is successfully applied to unreliable WSNs.

J	Wu, KH; Reeves, DS				Wu, KH; Reeves, DS			Capacity planning of DiffServ networks with best-effort and Expedited Forwarding traffic	TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS												For networks providing a specific level of service guarantees, capacity planning is an imperative part of network management. Accurate dimensioning is especially important in DiffServ networks, where no per-flow signaling or control exists. In this paper, we address the problem of capacity planning for DiffServ networks with only Expedited Forwarding (EF) and best effort (BE) traffic classes. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem, where the total link cost is minimized, subject to the performance constraints of both EF and BE classes. The edge to edge EF demand pairs and the BE demands on each link are given. The variables to be determined are the non-bifurcated routing of EF traffic, and the discrete link capacities. We show that Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient optimization methods can be used to effectively solve the problem. Computational results show that the solution quality is verifiably good while the running time remains reasonable on practical-sized networks. This represents the first work for capacity planning of multi-class IP networks with non-linear performance constraints and discrete link capacity constraints.																			1018-4864	1572-9451				MAR-APR	2004	25	3-4					193	207		10.1023/B:TELS.0000014781.92903.7f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:TELS.0000014781.92903.7f													WOS:000188745800003

From the perspective of economics, it is too rough if a surge arrester is installed in each pole. How to design the number of surge arresters and their locations in an overhead distribution network according to some economic and technical criteria is a challenging issue in the field of smart grid. This paper formulates this issue firstly as a typical discrete optimization problem by maximizing an economic performance index. Then, an adaptive binary particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to search for an optimal location strategy of surge arresters. The superiority of the proposed method to binary genetic algorithm-based, binary differential evolution-based method is tested for a typical overhead distribution network in terms of the global best fitness, the optimized number of surge arresters, and the number of flashovers.

These nanodevices are used to achieve some analog functions such as constant current sourcing, decaying term emulation, and resistive connection; all of them representing parameters of the neural network. The expected dynamics of this silicon circuit with these functional memristors is demonstrated via SPICE simulations based on 0.5 mu m, n-well CMOS technology. The neural circuit is operative by finding the optimal solution of small-size combinatorial optimization problems, namely: "Assignment" and "Transportation". It was chosen fast switching titanium dioxide memristors, which are modeled with nonlinear window functions and tunneling effect with the TEAM paradigm. This analog network belongs to an early recurrent model, which is electrically redesigned to take into account memristive arrays but keeping its original convergence properties. The behavioral and electrical analysis is done via Simulink-SPICE simulation. The outcome VLSI functional blocks combine both current and voltage to represent the variables in the recurrent model.

The considered continuous-time switched neural networks are motivated by biological neural networks which contain a nonlinear term and a changeable switched signal. The concept of MDADT is introduced, in which every subsystem has its own dwell time before switching to another subsystem. Moreover, a novel sliding mode controller is designed by an event-triggered mechanism which is based on the observer error and the system mode, where its triggered condition can be more conservative and practical than the existing triggered conditions. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the closed-loop system is stochastically exponentially stable in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The designed sliding mode controller can promote the sliding mode motion of the system state. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed method.

An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the Urban Transit Routing Problem	ELECTRONICS												The Urban Transit Routing Problem (UTRP) is a challenging discrete problem that revolves around designing efficient routes for public transport systems. It falls under the category of NP-hard problems, characterized by its complexity and numerous constraints. Evaluating potential route sets for feasibility is a demanding and time-consuming task, often resulting in the rejection of many solutions. Given its difficulty, metaheuristic methods, such as swarm intelligence algorithms, are considered highly suitable for addressing the UTRP. However, the effectiveness of these methods depends heavily on appropriately adapting them to discrete problems, as well as employing suitable initialization procedures and solution-evaluation methods. In this study, a new variant of the particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed as an efficient solution approach for the UTRP. We present an improved initialization function and improved modification operators, along with a post-optimization routine to further improve solutions. The algorithm's performance is then compared to the state of the art using Mandl's widely recognized benchmark, a standard for evaluating UTRP solutions. By comparing the generated solutions to published results from 10 studies on Mandl's benchmark network, we demonstrate that the developed algorithm outperforms existing techniques, providing superior outcomes.

The DMN reduces the port-to-port coupling and enhances the diversity of the antennas. By applying the DMN, the radiation efficiency can also be improved when one port is fed and the other port is match terminated. The proposed DMN works at two frequencies simultaneously without the need for any switch. As a proof of concept, a dual-band DMN for a pair of monopoles spaced 0.05 lambda apart is designed.

J	Sun, QT; Li, SYR				Sun, Qifu Tyler; Li, Shuo-Yen Robert			On decoding of DVR-based linear network codes	APPLICABLE ALGEBRA IN ENGINEERING COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTING												The conventional theory of linear network coding (LNC) is only over acyclic networks. Convolutional network coding (CNC) applies to all networks. It is also a form of LNC, but the linearity is w.r.t. the ring of rational power series rather than the field of data symbols. CNC has been generalized to LNC w.r.t. any discrete valuation ring (DVR) in order for flexibility in applications. For a causal DVR-based code, all possible source-generated messages form a free module, while incoming coding vectors to a receiver span the received submodule. An existing time-invariant decoding algorithm is at a delay equal to the largest valuation among all invariant factors of the received submodule. This intrinsic algebraic attribute is herein proved to be the optimal decoding delay. Meanwhile, time-variant decoding is formulated. The meaning of time-invariant decoding delay gets a new interpretation through being a special case of the time-variant counterpart. The optimal delay turns out to be the same for time-variant decoding, but the decoding algorithm is more flexible in terms of decodability check and decoding matrix design. All results apply, in particular, to CNC.

The approaches are based on the solution of optimization problems that have, in general, a Mixed Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) formulation. Given that the problems are NP-hard, exact methods for finding optimal solutions can be used only for scenarios of limited size. In this framework, the paper proposes a heuristic for finding a suboptimal solution of the Power Aware Routing and Network Design (PARND) problem, which is one of the more general design problems in Network Power Management. The simulation study highlights the capability of the proposed heuristic to obtain solutions near the optimum and to outperform the other approaches in terms of energy savings, while satisfying the constraints of the traffic demands.

As the process technology advances to nanometer era, IR drop becomes very significant, which may have great impact on circuit performance and reliability. Insufficient power supply to a circuit block will lead to performance degradation or even functional failure. Although such IR-drop problem can be minimized by widening metal wires or applying mesh routing structures of the power network, excessive metal usage of those power nets with different supply voltages will significantly increase both chip area and cost. This paper presents a new IR-aware routing method to simultaneously route multiple power nets in a mixed-signal design with the considerations of routing congestion, routing tree splitting, wire tapering, and metal layer optimization. Experimental results show that the presented method can effectively reduce total metal usage and satisfy IR-drop constraints.

The properties of this network can be converted block-by-block into a discrete-time version of the same model, in which the relationships existing between the system variables take the form of delay-free loops. In the presence of such loops, the discrete-time filter network is solved by iterating over a fixed-point scheme. Simulations running at 176.4 kHz show reasonable fidelity of the model in the regimes of interest, as well as shorter computation time compared to previous implementations of the same system. While reducing aliasing, such a sampling rate optimizes also the computation time as it requires fewer fixed-point iterations. The new model represents an improved alternative to previously developed voltage-controlled filter designs in the field of virtual analog.

Research on cognitive radio has for a large part, focused on physical layer issues such as robust spectrum sensing and radio environment characterization. The networking of cognitive radio nodes is equally important however as new protocols need to be developed to cope with physical layer dynamics. The lack of a widely used and open source simulation platform has been a hindrance in this regard. In this paper, we present crSimulator, which is a discrete simulation model for cognitive radio ad hoc networks in OMNeT++. We present the core concepts, major requirements, architectural model of cognitive radio nodes, and the implementation details of crSimulator. The crSimulator model effectively captures the physical layer level dynamics and facilitates higher layers protocol research. The model is validated with an implementation of cognitive radio MAC protocol having spectrum sensing and handover features together with a node architecture designed to operate in ad hoc networks.																					978-1-4673-5616-9; 978-1-4673-5615-2				2013																								WOS:000325088400077

Domain Swapping in Materials Design	BIOPOLYMERS												Peptide self-assembly can be used as a bottom-up approach to material fabrication. Although many different types of materials can be prepared from peptides, hydrogels are perhaps one of the most common, Gels typically result from the self-assembly of peptides into fibrillar networks. Controlling the structural morphology of these fibrils and the networks they form allows direct control over a given material's bulk properties. However, exerting this control is extremely difficult as the mechanistic rules that govern peptide self-assembly are far from being established. Conversely, several amyloidogenic proteins have been shown to self-assemble into fibrils using a mechanism known as domain swapping. Here, discrete units of secondary structure or even whole domains are exchanged (swapped) among discrete proteins during self-assembly to form extended networks with precise structural control This review discusses several common mechanistic variations of domain swapping using naturally occurring proteins as examples. The possibility of using these principles to design peptides capable of controlled assembly and fibril formation leading to materials with targeted properties is explored.

The nonlinear system is modeled via T-S fuzzy model. Both imperfect sensor-to-controller (S/C) and controller-to-actuator (C/A) links are considered via a novel data model. Some slack matrices are introduced to reduce the conservativeness. By constructing fuzzy Lyapunov function, the sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the resulting closed-loop system to be stochastically stable as well as the predefined H-infinity performance index. Finally, some simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Security of Cyber-Physical Systems: Design of a Security Supervisor to Thwart Attacks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computing and communication capabilities to monitor and control physical processes. In order to do so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors, actuators, and controllers in the feedback system. The use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of CPSs to cyberattacks that can drive the system to unsafe states. One of the most powerful cyberattacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack, where the intruder can observe, hide, create, or change information in the attacked network channels. In this article, we propose a defense strategy that can thwart man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control communication channels of CPSs modeled as discrete-event systems. We also introduce the definition of network attack security (NA-Security), which is related to the possibility of preventing the system from reaching unsafe states by using a security supervisor, whose online implementation has polynomial computational complexity, and we propose an algorithm to verify this property.

To deal with disruption risks, several resilience strategies (including multiple sourcing, facility fortification, adding extra production capacity, multi-channel distribution, and pricing) are applied. A model with the objective of maximizing the profit is proposed, which uses a two-stage stochastic programming approach. In order to cope with the problem's complexity, a constructive heuristic method and two metaheuristics, including an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) and an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) are developed. After tuning the parameters of metaheuristics via the Taguchi method, various numerical instances are utilized to test the validity and efficiency of the model and solution methods. Further, a real industrial case study is provided and analyzed. Results show that the constructive heuristic outperforms other solution methods and the performed analysis indicates that utilizing resilient strategies has a remarkable effect on reducing losses originating from risks and maintaining market share against competitors.

A control law is designed, and sufficient conditions are established that guarantee the synchronization of two identical DSNNs with random delays. Compared with the previous works, the time delay is assumed to be existent in a random fashion. The stochastic disturbances are described in terms of a Brownian motion and the time-varying delay is characterized by introducing a Bernoulli stochastic variable. Two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. The main contribution of this paper is that the obtained results are dependent on not only the bound but also the distribution probability of the time delay. Moreover, our results provide a larger allowance variation range of the delay, and are less conservative than the traditional delay-independent ones.

Integration of sale and leaseback in the optimal design of supply chain networks	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												Supply chain network (SCN) modeling has gain a great research interest as companies realized that scientific approaches in managing their SCN's, rather than "common-sense" heuristics, are the roads to achieve sustainability, profitability, growth, and competiveness. Ever since, the relevant literature is supplied with models that aim to optimize SCN's design and/or operation. The former is a strategic process that designs network's infrastructure and concerns long term investments which undertake huge amounts of capitals. SCN managers should be able to evaluate how these decisions contribute to the overall performance of the company and not assess them with only cost oriented indicators. By employing advance financial management methods, such as sale and leaseback (SLB), fixed assets could be the medium to improve liquidity and strengthen credit solvency. This paper aims to enrich the SCN design literature by introducing a Mixed-Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) model that integrates SLB technique with SCN design decisions. By exploiting the properties of the MINLP model it is reformulated into an exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that is solved to global optimality. A real case study from a consumer goods company is utilized in order to show model's functionality and to evaluate its adaptability, robustness, and benefit. The model could assist and support SCN managers in effective decision making in the strategic level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The scheme exploits the centralized robust controller, the channel scheduler, and the synchrophasor from the distribution network PMU to achieve fast coordination of DG and recovery of voltage under the condition of restricted communication channel resources. In this paper, a unified mathematical model based on an uncertain discrete time-delay switched system is developed, considering both channel scheduling and voltage control. A design of a robust cost-guaranteed voltage controller considering dynamic channel scheduling is proposed to ensure stability. Further, an optimal dynamic channel scheduling strategy is proposed to provide performance optimization via the channel scheduler for the control system. The simulation validates the effectiveness of the proposed co-design scheme in terms of stability and improvement of performance under limited communication resources.

Discrete-time controllers for temperature control of a polystyrene polymerization reactor	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												For temperature control, styrene free radical polymerization in a 1.1 I batch reactor was presented with the zero-order hold equivalent discrete time models in the present work. Two discrete-time controllers were applied to the reactor. Firstly, a discrete-time controller with three tuning parameters was designed, and its parameters were determined by checking control performance and closed loop pole-placement in z-plane. The sixth order closed loop transfer function between reactor temperature and set point was obtained. The best tuning parameters were determined as -0.1, -0.9 and -0.1. Effect of tuning parameters to stability was investigated. Secondly, the discrete-time proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller (2DOF) was employed. Simulink control design was utilized for tuning the six parameters of the controller as -10.75, -1.09, -19.26, -0.689, 0.1686, 4.123e-0.5 respectively. These controller performances were compared to each other for a step decrease in set point. It is noted that a very close matching was achieved and the controllers have made the closed loop system desirable and stable with the best tuned parameters determined. In order to obtain good quality 52000 g/mole polystyrene, these two different discrete-time controllers were applied theoretically for tracking previously determined optimal temperature profile. The previously published experimental data were used for validation. Cooling water flow rate was manipulated to obtain better control performance with minimum response time and reduced production cost. In the set point tracking cases studied, the best tuned controllers acted to produce non-oscillatory closed loop behaviour without offset throughout the length of the batch run.

The observability of such systems is aggravated by the loss of notion of time in a system-wide consistent manner. To overcome this problem, a suitable affine clock model with unknown parameters is introduced and the observability map of nonlinear systems with discrete-time measurements is extended accordingly. Consequently, observability is formulated in terms of full-rankness of the Jacobian of the extended observability map. This formulation is independent of the network induced packet delays but depends on the information content in the control input. For this reason, necessary conditions are derived for the control input to be sufficiently exciting. The obtained terminology and conditions are illustrated on a numerical example and the practical relevance is demonstrated on a real networked pendulum test-rig.																			0743-1546		978-1-4673-2066-5				2012							1349	1355																WOS:000327200401118

To better approximate the practical GRNs, a discrete model with time-varying parameters is introduced. By appropriately constructing a time-varying Lyapunov function, sufficient criteria in terms of a set of recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs) are obtained firstly under which the filtering error system achieves the prescribed H-infinity performance constraint on the finite horizon. And then the time-varying filter parameter matrices are designed iteratively according to the explicit solutions of the RLMIs. Finally, the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper is illustrated via a numerical simulation example.

The information on the dynamics of the fault is not required with an appropriate structure of the proposed fault estimator. Unbiased state and fault estimation can be obtained simultaneously at each node only with locally available information, thereby avoiding the requirement of a centre node which collects information from every node. Considering the effects of time delays and the interconnections between different nodes, an upper bound of the estimation error covariance is calculated, and the desired filter parameters are obtained in a recursive manner such that the trace of the bound is minimised. The existence conditions of the developed filter are provided explicitly as well. Finally, a simulation example is employed to demonstrate the state estimation and fault diagnosis performances of the given strategy.

Using delay decomposition technique, new delay-dependent criteria ensuring the considered system to be (Q, R, S)-gamma dissipative are established in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities. A new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed by dividing the discrete and neutral delay intervals into m and l segments, respectively, and choosing different Lyapunov functionals to different segments. Further, the dissipativity behaviors of neural networks which are affected due to the sensitiveness of the time delay in the leakage term have been taken into account.

J	XIONG, YH; SCHNEIDER, JB				XIONG, YH; SCHNEIDER, JB			PROCESSING OF CONSTRAINTS IN TRANSPORTATION NETWORK DESIGN PROBLEM	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING												In the discrete transportation network design problem it is often the case that some projects are mutually exclusive projects: they cannot be selected simultaneously. Some projects are concurrent projects: they have to be selected together. Or, one project cannot be selected unless another one is also selected. All of these are called constraints. At the end of the design process, the final solutions must be the best feasible solutions, which satisfy all constraints. So, this paper presents a method for doing constraint processing within a cumulative genetic algorithm. This paper first briefly introduces the method of using the cumulative genetic algorithm and a neural network to design transportation networks. Then, some examples are given to show how constraints are proposed and how they reflect restrictions encountered in practice. Next, an analysis is made of alternative constraint processing methods and the optimization process is modified within the cumulative genetic algorithm. Furthermore, two groups of constraints for a test network are defined to test the method. It is found that the results from this search process are indeed the best feasible solutions. This study shows that the cumulative genetic algorithm, which employs a neural network, works very well in processing the constraints.																			0887-3801					JAN	1995	9	1					21	28		10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(1995)9:1(21)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(1995)9:1(21)													WOS:A1995QC14300003

An MHCN is one of the typical examples in cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose a new method of stochastic model predictive control for MHCNs with packet dropouts. In the proposed method, a given MHCN is modeled by a stochastic switched system. Then, we consider the finite-time optimal control problem of minimizing the cost function given by the quadratic form with respect to the expected value of the state and the control input. This problem is reduced to a mixed integer programming problem. By solving it, both communication paths and control inputs are optimized simultaneously.

Neural networks for prediction of deflection in composite bridges	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH												Neural networks have been developed for prediction of deflections, at service load, in steel-concrete composite bridges incorporating flexibility of shear connectors, shear lag effect and cracking in concrete slabs. Three neural networks have been presented to cover simply supported bridges, two span continuous bridges and three span continuous bridges. The use of the neural networks requires a computational effort almost equal to that required for the simple beam analysis (neglecting flexibility of shear connectors, shear lag effect and cracking of concrete). The training and testing data for neural networks are generated using finite element software ABAQUS. The neural networks have been validated for number of bridges and the errors are found to be small. Closed form solutions are also proposed based on the developed neural networks. The networks/ closed form solutions can be used for rapid prediction of deflection for everyday design. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is a challenging problem because concrete mix design, particularly when involving waste materials, is impacted not only by the concrete mix performance but also on material availability and local variation in chemical composition. This variation impacts material performance, financial cost and environmental sustainability. This paper presents a generic framework for mix design optimisation based on a material design and profiling tool coupled with an optimisation algorithm. The framework is then demonstrated for geopolymer concrete (GPC) using a new data-driven mix design tool based on an artificial neutral network to predict mechanical properties (compressive strength and slump) coupled with life-cycle assessment and financial models to quantify mix performance. Together these inputs are used as the basis for single and multi-objective optimisation using a genetic algorithm as part of set of scenarios examining the impact of regional scale transportation scenarios and the chemical composition of binders on the resultant mix properties. The framework's implementation for GPC enabled up to a 50% reduction in CO2-eq emissions compared to equivalent strength experimental mixes, and demonstrated that for a given strength, slump and transportation case the overall CO2-eq emissions can increase by up to 30% where multi-objective optimisation is used (financial and CO2-eq emissions minimization) when compared to minimization of CO2-eq emissions alone.

The use of such discrete rotor position feedback usually means a six-step current waveform must be used to excite the stator. However, the application of non-sinusoidal currents to the stator results in less than optimal operating conditions, such as torque ripple and reduced efficiency. In this paper. a pseudo-sensorless position estimator is used together with Hall sensors to provide sinusoidal current excitation in place of the six-step strategy. A rotor position estimator based on the machine model is designed and simulated. In addition, a recurrent neural network is constructed and trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation of the rotor position estimator in a PMSM drive is provided through simulation.																			0969-1170					MAR	2000	8	1					59	65																WOS:000086087400009

An intrusion detection network (IDN) is a collaborative IDS network intended to overcome this weakness by allowing IDS peers to share collective knowledge and experience, hence improve the overall accuracy of intrusion assessment. In this work, we design an incentive model based on trust management by using game theory for peers to collaborate truthfully without free-riding in an IDN environment. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in an incentive compatible manner. Using duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium. Our numerical experiments and discrete event simulation demonstrate the convergence to the Nash equilibrium and the incentives of the resource allocation design.

Outage Probability of Multiuser Mixed RF/FSO Relay Schemes for Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks (H-CRANs)	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS												The increase in deployment of various advanced wireless technologies, services, and applications have put significant pressure on the mobile network operators (MNOs) in terms of system requirements such as capacity, quality of service (QoS), and network coverage. In an effort to optimally meet the system requirements, the MNOs are confronted with high total cost of ownership (TCO), however, the associated income is relatively low. In order to address the challenges, MNOs as well as service providers (SPs) have given considerable interest to the small-cell schemes along with the associated advanced centralized and heterogeneous network architectures. This is due to their beneficial qualities regarding system performance optimization and cost-effectiveness. However, achieving the stringent requirements of the fronthaul for connecting the network elements is highly demanding. In this paper, taking into consideration the small-cell network architectures, we present multiuser mixed radio-frequency/free-space optical (RF/FSO) relay schemes as viable means of alleviating the stringent requirements. Furthermore, we study the end-to-end outage performance of the mixed RF/FSO schemes considering the effect of pointing errors in the FSO links.

In this paper, we propose a novel network-aware P2P file architecture and related control schemes that can provide continuous resource retrieval and discovery for mobile users over the wireless network environment. The proposed architecture divides a P2P file sharing network into multiple network-aware clusters, in which peers are assigned to a network-aware cluster using a network prefix division. Accordingly, there are two designs for supporting mobile peers to retrieve files in wireless mobile networks. First, a novel file discovery control scheme named mobility-aware file discovery control (MAFDC) scheme is devised to obtain fresh status of shared peers and find the new resource providing peers in wireless mobile networks. Second, a resource provider selection algorithm is devised to enable a mobile peer to select new resource providing peers for continuous file retrieval.																			0733-8716	1558-0008				JAN	2007	25	1					204	210		10.1109/JSAC.2007.070120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070120													WOS:000243597900020

By using an appropriate variable transformation, the order of the ICVRNN differential system is reduced, and then, by applying the real decomposition method, it is separated into real and imaginary components. The matrix measure approach with the nonlinear Lipschitz activation functions is employed in the ICVRNN model. Through the proper description of the matrix measure approach, some sufficient conditions have been derived for the quasi -projective synchronization criteria of the considered model through designing a suitable controller. Here, some significant results have been provided for the ICVRNNs with mismatched parameters and mixed time -varying delay. Finally, two numerical simulations are discussed to validate the feasibility and persistence of our obtained results with few conditions.

Due to the complex nature of the various interacting phenomena in the process, designing model-based controllers can prove to be a challenge. In this paper a NARX neural network model is trained to describe the complex relationship between the applied current to an Electromagnetic Brake (EMBr) and the measured meniscus velocity. The data for the model is obtained using a laboratory scale continuous casting plant. Adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) was used to deal with the non-linearity of the model by adapting the prediction model to the different operating conditions. The controller uses the EMBr as an actuator to keep the meniscus velocity within the optimum range, and reject disturbances that occur during the casting process such as changing the casting speed.

The Underground Logistics System (ULS) is a sustainable option to overcome traffic congestion while improving freight transport efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive layout design and facility planning method for the two-echelon urban ULS network with hub-and-spoke structure. The underground network is organized by the primary and secondary ULS nodes and tunnels which have strong alignment with existing logistics nodes such as distribution centers and major demand terminals. A bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model considering minimal costs and maximal system utilization was established to formulate the location-allocation of ULS nodes, tunnel layout and flow routing in the network. Given the inherent problem complexity, a series of simplification techniques and hybrid optimization procedures integrating both exact and meta-heuristic algorithms were developed to obtain high quality solutions. Finally, a real-world simulation was carried out in Beijing, China to demonstrate the applicability of proposed method. Results show that our procedures can effectively obtain the best configurations of ULS network under various scenarios and has better convergence efficiency and optimality performance. Moreover, a group of horizontal tests and sensitivity analysis reveals further insights regarding ULS network decision-making and layout strategies.					, Bon Gang Hwang/S-2649-2018; joy, shone/AAR-3728-2020	Hu, Wanjie/0000-0001-6969-1012; Dong, Jianjun/0000-0003-3406-0573													0360-8352	1879-0550				JUN	2020	144								106452	10.1016/j.cie.2020.106452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2020.106452													WOS:000535972200022

Besides, imprecision and epistemic uncertainties also need to be taken into account for system reliability modeling and assessment. In this paper, a comprehensive study based on the evidential network is performed for the reliability analysis of complex systems with common cause failures and mixed uncertainties. The decomposed partial a-factor is used to separate the contribution of independent parts and common cause parts of basic failure events. Mixed uncertainties are quantified and expressed by the D-S evidence theory, and the system reliability with uncertainties is modeled by evidential network. Furthermore, two layers, i.e. a decomposed event layer and coupling layer, are embedded into the evidential network of the system, and, as a result, the hierarchical structure of system reliability is constructed. The importance and sensitivities of various component types and their impact on system reliability are detected. The presented evidential network-based hierarchical method is applied to analyze the reliability of an auxiliary power supply system of a train and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

The starting point of the design is a currently working model at the Spanish Transport System Operator, which is based on linear autoregressive techniques and neural networks. The forecasting system currently forecasts each of the regions within the Spanish grid separately, even though the behavior of the load in each region is affected by the same factors in a similar way. The integration of several regions into a linear mixed model allows using the information from other regions to learn general behaviors present in all regions while also identifying individual deviation in each regions. This technique is especially useful when modeling the effect of special days for which information from the past is scarce. The model described has been applied to the three most relevant regions of the system, focusing on special day and improving the performance of both currently working models used as benchmark.

The considered IMNNs are described as hybrid neural systems with second-order derivatives due to the combination of memristor and inertial items. By invoking an appropriate variable substitution method, the hybrid neural system is turned into a first-order differential system. Then, based on the nonsmooth analysis and Lyapunov stability theories, several new algebraic conditions for the global stability of IMNNs with unbounded distributed delays are derived. In addition, two simple classes of feedback control laws are designed for the considered IMNNs and the corresponding stabilizability criteria are established.

This paper proposes a new multi-period network design problem variant, in which modular capacities can be added or reduced along the planning horizon in order to adapt to demand changes. The problem further allows to represent economies of scales in function of the total arc capacity, a detail that has typically been overlooked in the literature. This paper particularly emphasizes the different alternatives to formulate the problem. We propose two different mixed-integer programming formulations and analyze further modeling alternatives. We theoretically compare the strength of all formulations and evaluate their computational performance in extensive experiments. The results suggest that a recent modeling technique using more precise decision variables yields the strongest formulation, which also results in significantly faster solution times. The use of this formulation may therefore be beneficial when considering similar problem variants. Finally, we also evaluate the economical benefits of the features introduced in this new problem variant, indicating that both the selection of the capacity levels and the capacity adjustment along time are likely to result in significant cost savings.																			0315-5986	1916-0615				NOV 1	2023	61	4					445	489		10.1080/03155986.2023.2229208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03155986.2023.2229208		JUN 2023											WOS:001037847600001

Development of compartment model for inhibition of thermal runaway in free-radical polymerization	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Shortstopping reactions via injection of chemical inhibitors is a promising technique of emergency response to prevent thermal runaway, with unique advantages of cost effectiveness and process sustainability over current evacuation practices. However, computational modeling of the inhibition process for ensuring successful designs remains challenging. In this paper, a compartment model is developed to investigate the design of the inhibition system with detailed characterization in both complex kinetic mechanism and nonideal mixing effect. The reactor volume is divided into a network-of-zones (NoZ), with each zone modeled as a well-mixed reactor. The free-radical solution polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in a stirred batch reactor is used as a demonstrative example. The flow parameters and network structure of compartment models are validated with the CFD simulation. The developed compartment models are employed to investigate interactions of poor mixing and exothermic chemistry that lead to thermal runaway and key design factors including injection location, quantity, kinetic requirement, and timing on the effectiveness of quenching thermal runaway.

Energy-Optimal Pump Scheduling and Water Flow	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL OF NETWORK SYSTEMS												This paper focuses on the optimal operation of water supply networks. We modelwater supply networks using hydraulic constraints, and formulate a joint optimal pump scheduling and water flow problem (OWF) using the hydraulic characteristics of variable speed pumps. OWF is a mixed-integer nonlinear program. This problem is nonconvex, and hence NP-hard. To compute an exact solution ofOWF, we first focus on the feasibility region ofOWF, and propose a mixed-integer second-order cone relaxation for the feasibility region of OWF. We prove that the proposed relaxation is exact for several relevant network topologies. We then focus on the objective function in OWF, and show that for some energy metrics, OWF can be transformed into a mixed-integer second-order cone program. Furthermore, we propose an ADMM-based algorithm to compute suboptimal solutions to OWF and lower bounds on the optimal value of the objective in OWF when the objective function is nonconvex. Finally, we consider a real-world water network, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed relaxation in computing the optimal pump schedules and water flows.																			2325-5870	2372-2533				SEP	2018	5	3					1016	1026		10.1109/TCNS.2017.2670501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCNS.2017.2670501													WOS:000445357100018

This paper presents new educational material based on Visual Programming and reconfigurable mixed-signal systems on a chip to teach mixed-domain co-design and integration, including analog, digital, and software. The paper presents a new introductory course for freshmen ECE students, which is currently being developed at Stony Brook University, and a senior design project that was successfully completed at Hofstra University.																			0190-5848		978-1-4244-1969-2				2008							866	+																WOS:000271669200202
J	Wang, YJ; Lin, CT				Wang, YJ; Lin, CT			Recurrent learning algorithms for designing optimal controllers of continuous systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS												This paper proposes the recurrent learning algorithm for designing thr controllers of continuous dynamical systems in the optimal control problems. The designed controllers are in the form of unfolded recurrent neural networks embedded with physical laws coming from the classical control techniques. The proposed learning algorithm is characterized by its double-forward-recurrent-loops structure for solving both the temporal recurrent and the structure recurrent problems. The first problem is resulted from the nature of general optimal control problems, where the objective functions are often related to (evaluated at) some specific (instead of all) time steps or system states only, causing missing Learning signals at some time steps or system states. The second problem is due to the high-order discretization of the continuous systems bg the Runge-Kutta method that we perform to increase the control accuracy. This discretization transforms the system into several identical subnetworks interconnected together, like a recurrent neural network expanded in the time axis. Two recurrent learning algorithms with different convergence properties are derived; the first- and second-order learning algorithms. The computations of both algorithms are local and performed efficiently as network signal propagation. We also propose two new nonlinear controller structures for two specific control problems:1) two-dimensional (2-D) guidance problem and 2) optimal PI control problem. Under the training of the proposed recurrent learning algorithms, these two controllers can be easily tuned to be suboptimal for given objective functions. Extensive computer simulations have shown the optimization and generalization abilities of the controllers designed bg the proposed learning scheme.

Choice complexity comes from the process of making choices for various assembly operations due to the product variety and impacts production rate which is the performance measure of the system. The choice complexity is measured with information entropy, and the relational expression between choice complexity and error rate is analyzed by means of those research finds on average reaction time and speed-accuracy trade-off. The main achievement of our study is establishing an artificial neural network meta-model for the impact of choice complexity on production rate. The meta-model performs better than a multiple linear regression meta-model in terms of experiment results and appears to be the optimal model of the impact of choice complexity on production rate in the mixed-model assembly system.

However, mobility of Mobile Station (MS) in MMR network might lead to performance degradation in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). Selecting an appropriate Relay Station (RS) that can support data transmission for high mobility MS to enhance QoS is one of the challenges in MMR network. The main goal of the work is to develop and enhance relay selection mechanisms that can assure continuous connectivity while ensuring QoS in MMR network using NCTUns simulation tools. The approach is to develop and enhance a relay selection for MS with continuous connectivity in non-transparent relay. In this approach, the standard network entry procedure is modified to allow continuous connectivity with reduced signaling messages whenever MS joins RS that is out of Multihop Relay Base Station (MRBS) coverage and the relay selection is based on Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The proposed relay selection mechanism that utilized Cross Layer Design (CLD) concept to select RS with good link quality for data transmission. The proposed network model of MMR network is analyzed mathematically using queuing theory approach. Theoretical analysis of the M/D/1 queuing model is compared with the simulation to validate that the simulation is working correctly. The result shows that the simulation performances conform to the theoretical value very closely, which prove the consistency of the simulation platform. Therefore, correctness of the simulation model is validated. Thus, the rest of the work is carried out through simulation on NCTUns.

Then, a mixed-task resource allocation problem with the consideration of computation and communication resources is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP), which cannot be handled by the traditional relaxation algorithm due to the joint design of binary and partial offloading. To solve this problem efficiently, we first adopt a replacement-based method to transform the problem, and then design an augmented Lagrange method (ALM)-based resource allocation scheme.

Classification and Error Estimation for Discrete Data	CURRENT GENOMICS												Discrete classification is common in Genomic Signal Processing applications, in particular in classification of discretized gene expression data, and in discrete gene expression prediction and the inference of boolean genomic regulatory networks. Once a discrete classifier is obtained from sample data, its performance must be evaluated through its classification error. In practice, error estimation methods must then be employed to obtain reliable estimates of the classification error based on the available data. Both classifier design and error estimation are complicated, in the case of Genomics, by the prevalence of small-sample data sets in such applications. This paper presents a broad review of the methodology of classification and error estimation for discrete data, in the context of Genomics, focusing on the study of performance in small sample scenarios, as well as asymptotic behavior.

To overcome this challenge, we combine the merits of semi-interpenetrating polymer network and nanohybrid to maintain a high PEO loading and robust membrane structure. The membranes were prepared by introducing in-situ formed PEO networks with silica nodes into Pebax1657 to produce a semi-interpenetrating network structure. The introduced network and in situ formed silica nanoparticles reduce the chain packing efficiency of Pebax matrix to enhance the CO2 diffusivity, while the increased PEO content enhances CO2 solubility. Under feed gas pressure of 25 bar, nanohybrid membranes containing 40 wt% polymer network display excellent gas separation performance with CO2 permeability of 272.8 Barrer and CO2/N2 selectivity of 79.6 under mixed gas separation tests, surpassing 2008 Robeson upper bound. Moreover, the hybrid membranes showed high mechanical strength, the Young's modulus increases by 1.95 times. This strategy provides a simple route for the design of nanohybrid membranes with high separation performance as well as excellent durability.					zhang, jt/JVE-1333-2024; Wang, Siyi/JNT-2690-2023; Zhao, Xuan/JMR-2135-2023; Wang, Hao/ABB-8923-2020; Chen, Chao/JHS-6563-2023; Zhang, Chi/JSK-0744-2023; Wang, Shaofei/C-4875-2017; Lu, Lu/JPE-5187-2023	Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9109-6017; Wang, Shaofei/0000-0002-1790-7149; 													0376-7388	1873-3123				MAY 15	2023	674								121516	10.1016/j.memsci.2023.121516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2023.121516		FEB 2023											WOS:000948923100001

Chandru			6G assisted federated learning for continuous monitoring in wireless sensor network using game theory	WIRELESS NETWORKS												In-Game theory Applications, the 6G-assisted federated learning in continuous monitoring applications with wireless sensor networks (WSN) is a significant concern. With increased applications comes the increased demand for advanced resource allocation and energy management systems. WSN can be determined as a self-configured, infrastructure-less wireless network monitoring physical or other surrounding conditions. In this study, the proposed system is concentrated on applying game theory to 6G-assisted federated learning for continuous monitoring in wireless sensor networks. The techniques imposed by the dual sink, such as Static and dynamic moving nodes approaches, are applied to the tentative node selection based on aggregated data transmission techniques. Based on the Static nodes and trusted nodes, the Aggregated data transmission is achieved high-level data transmission by combining individual-level data, i.e., the aggregate of the output data. This technique is performed with the wireless sensor network (WSN) platform with a future 6G network coordinating with the tool of NS4-Programmable Data Plane simulation. The proposed system simplifies the development of a behavioral model and bridges the gap between simulation and deployment. Finally, the combination of game theory with 6G-assisted federated learning for continuous monitoring applications in WSN solves problems and identifies several future directions. The outcome analysis of the proposed system is to design the wireless sensor network to yield a high network lifetime of more than 20 h and low power (less than 0.2 kJ energy) consumption for efficient communication in the future 6G cellular network.

J	Leo, J; Kalita, J				Leo, Justin; Kalita, Jugal			Survey of continuous deep learning methods and techniques used for incremental learning	NEUROCOMPUTING												Neural networks and deep learning algorithms are designed to function similarly to biological synaptic structures. However, classical deep learning algorithms fail to fully capture the need for continuous learning; this has led to the advent of incremental learning. Incremental learning adds new challenges that are handled differently by modern state-of-the-art approaches. Some of these include: utilization of network memory as additional knowledge increases the size of the network, open -set recognition to be able to identify unrecognized information, and efficient knowledge distillation as most incremental learning algorithms are prone to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Recent advancements achieve incremental learning through a multitude of methods. Most methods are characterized by augmenting the normal algorithm of neural network training by both directly modifying the neural network structure and by adding additional learning steps. This paper analyzes and provides a comprehensive survey of existing methods and various techniques used for incremental learning. A novel categorization of the methods is also introduced based on recent trends of the state-of-the-art solutions. The study focuses on methods that provide incremental learning success as well as discusses emerging patterns in new research.

J	Garg, M; Smith, JC				Garg, Manish; Smith, J. Cole			Models and algorithms for the design of survivable multicommodity flow networks with general failure scenarios	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												We consider the design of a multicommodity flow network, in which point-to-point demands are routed across the network subject to link capacity restrictions. Such a design must build enough capacity and diverse Muting paths through the network to ensure that feasible multicommodity flows continue to exist, even when components of the network fail. In this paper, we examine several methodologies to optimally design a minimum-cost Survivable network that continues to support a multicommodity flow under any of a given set of failure scenarios, where each failure scenario consists of the simultaneous failure of multiple arcs. We begin by providing a single extensive form mixed-integer programming formulation for this problem, along with a Benders decomposition algorithm as an alternative to the extensive form approach. We next investigate strategies to improve the performance of the algorithm by augmenting the master problem with several valid inequalities such as cover constraints, connectivity constraints, and path constraints. For the smallest instances (eight nodes, 10 origin-destination pairs, and 10 failure scenarios), the Benders implementation consumes only 10% of the time required by the mixed-integer programming formulation, and our best augmentation strategy reduces the Solution time by another 50%.

A system model is established based on the characteristics of uncertain time delay and packet loss in WSN. In this model, system uncertainties are represented by random time delay and stochastic packet loss, which are described by a Markov chain. By using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, a mode-dependent mixed H-2/H-infinity controller is designed to guarantee both the stochastic stability of the closed-loop system and the prescribed H-2,H-infinity control performances. The sufficient conditions for the existence of the controller are proved by a series of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). If these LMIs are feasible, the mode-dependent mixed H-2/H-infinity controller can be obtained. Matlab LMI toolbox is used to calculate the control law. Finally, a numerical example and its simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.																			1598-6446	2005-4092				JAN	2021	19	1					88	100		10.1007/s12555-018-0508-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12555-018-0508-9		AUG 2020											WOS:000555756300017

The ratios of amplitude to wavelength of the sinusoidal walls, throat width to depth of the convergent-divergent sections, and diameter of the inner circular wall to wavelength were chosen as the design variables for optimization. The full-factorial method was used to discretize the design space. The mixing index and nondimensional pressure loss were selected as objective functions. Radial basis neural network functions were used to train the objective functions. The optimization was carried out at a Reynolds number of 30. A concave Pareto-optimal front representing the trade-off between the two objective functions was obtained. The analysis of representative designs along the Pareto-optimal front showed significant variation in the ratio of throat width to depth of the convergent-divergent sections, whereas the ratio of amplitude to wavelength of the sinusoidal walls maintained a nearly constant value. The concept of mixing effectiveness was used to select the most efficient designs considering both the mixing performance and pressure drop.

The data path is all optical with electrical-to-optical signal translation taking place only at the message source and optical-to-electrical signal translation laking place only at the destination. The control path, however, makes extensive use of electrical technology, using a unique control algorithm appropriate to the mixed-technology design.

The optimum mix of coconut pulp waste (7.46 g), banana peels (0.01 g) and pineapple peels (7.53 g) gave a maximum lipase activity of 339.4 U/gds. The effect of inducers (castor oil, jatropha oil and olive oil) on lipase production from the substrate mix was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). ANN predictions were marginally superior to those of RSM. Optimized levels of castor oil (1.99%w/w), jatropha oil (0.02%w/w) and olive oil (1.99%w/w) yielded a maximum lipase activity of 488.7 U/gds which was a 30.6% increase compared to the un-induced system. Global sensitivity analysis revealed that olive oil was the most sensitive inducer. Thus, biological induction can enhance the production of lipase from the ternary substrate mix.

Future turbine engines would have lower lifetime operating costs similar to current evolving automotive systems. Detailed multi-physics models (thermo-fluid, structural and mechanical systems) and an operational environment are enablers of rapid correction and model-based predictive analyses. Bayesian machine learning paradigms are developed to identify the behavior of turbo-machinery components for preliminary design. The embedded models approach enables systematic evolution from individual components level to the advanced engine. The embedded models approach enables systematic evolution from individual components level to the advanced engine. A rapid response strategy is proposed, for design of turbine disks by using multidisciplinary optimization and neural networks. iSIGHT optimization software is interfaced with ANSYS to find optimum designs for a given set of design boundary conditions (rpm, live rim load, thermals, etc.). The optimum designs obtained from iSIGHT for different set of design conditions are used for machine learning and design knowledge recognition using the neural network technique. The trained network is used to predict responses for design boundary conditions. Responses predicted by the neural network are validated using ANSYS. Discrete design points are chosen from the wide design space of turbine disks. A hierarchical neural network approach provides an ability to quickly train the network and predict responses (weight, stresses, burst margin, etc.) for applied design conditions. This basic building process involves four steps starting from identifying design boundary conditions to the prediction of design shape for the disk. Sensitivity-based scaling rules are developed, to accommodate different materials for the disk. The technique is developed in RAPIDDISK, which provides an optimal preliminary shape and design attributes for a turbine disk.																			1615-147X	1615-1488				MAR	2005	29	3					213	231		10.1007/s00158-004-0472-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00158-004-0472-2													WOS:000227696800006

The insertion of communication networks between negative feedback interconnected passive systems inevitably induces delays and data packet dropouts. To model the network-based negative feedback interconnected system, an appropriate network scheduling method is presented to deal with time-varying network-induced delays and data packet dropouts. By constructing a novel discontinuous Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a less conservative sufficient condition for the network-based feedback interconnected system to be asymptotically stable is derived. Based on the stability condition, a new sufficient condition to make the negative feedback interconnected system in network environments remain passive is developed.

Intelligent devices (e.g., sensors, actuators) with integrated computation and communication capabilities enable high-level modularity, not only with the respect to hardware components but also in terms of control functionality; this can be achieved by distributing control to different network-connected devices. Thus, to enable fast and reliable system reconfigurations, in this brief, we introduce a method for distribution of control tasks and generation of control code for the devices in the control network. Our approach is based on the control interpreted Petri nets (CIPNs) formalism. We start from a CIPN capturing the centralized (overall) control system, and the mapping of input and output signals to local controllers (LCs) (i.e., smart devices) that have direct physical access to system sensors and actuators. From these, our method automatically designs distributed control tasks for LCs in the network, as well as generates control code for each LC. The applicability of the proposed method is experimentally verified on two real-world case studies.

Software-Defined Network (SDN) makes a paradigm evolution from the existing networks as it decouples between network control and data forwarding, and brings unprecedented programmability for network management. However, an SDN-enabled approach in tactical ad hoc networks gives rise to new challenges since the original architecture is not designed to apply in mobile ad hoc network. In this paper, we propose a novel SDN-enabled architecture designed for tactical ad hoc networks. Then both the problem of controller deployments and the assignment of data plane are modeled based on delay and energy consumption. We solve the model above using Mixed Integer Programming, Experimental results show that our method performs well in both the data plane delay guarantees and the energy consumption optimization.

However, existing network representation methods are commonly designed for homogeneous information networks where all the nodes (entities) of a network are of the same type, e.g., papers in a citation network. In this paper, we propose a universal network representation approach (UNRA), that represents different types of nodes in heterogeneous information networks in a continuous and common vector space. The UNRA is built on our latest mutually updated neural language module, which simultaneously captures inter-relationship among homogeneous nodes and node-content correlation. Relationships between different types of nodes are also assembled and learned in a unified framework. Experiments validate that the UNRA achieves outstanding performance, compared to six other state-of-the-art algorithms, in node representation, node classification, and network visualization. In node classification, the UNRA achieves a 3% to 132% performance improvement in terms of accuracy.

The new synthesis method aims to systematically generate many candidate networks and, through the use of more detailed individual heat exchanger designs and their evaluation over all periods, guide the network optimisation to more realistic designs. This is done by using the multi-period mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) stage-wise superstructure (SWS) model and modifying it to include correction factors. These correction factors enable the MINLP optimisation of the overall cost of the designed network, which uses only shortcut models of the individual exchangers, to be guided by more detailed models of the individual heat exchangers that comprise the network. The designs obtained at the topology optimisation stage thus more accurately represent an actual network. The correction factors take into account aspects of the real design, such as TEMA standards, FT correction factors, number of shells, and changes in overall heat transfer coefficients. Each exchanger is designed to function over all periods of operation, and if this is not possible, extra exchangers are designed for the periods that cannot be satisfied. The methodology is applied to a case study that demonstrates the benefits of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regional sampled-data synchronization of chaotic neural networks using piecewise-continuous delay dependent Lyapunov functional	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION												In this paper, a regional sampled-data synchronization criterion is proposed for the chaotic neural networks (CNNs) with input saturation using the piecewise-continuous delay dependent Lyapunov functional (PDDLF) approach. The aim of this work is to enlarge the region of attraction (ROA) of the synchronous state for CNNs with input saturation. Unlike existing works, the Lyapunov functional in the proposed approach is constructed from a polynomial with respect to the piecewise-continuous delay. Moreover, the proposed Lyapunov functional is combined with looped-functionals to derive the sufficient condition. The synchronization criterion is formulated in terms of sum of squares (SOS) programs, which reduces the infinite-dimensional linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions to a finite number of SOS conditions. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Bao, HB; Cao, JD				Bao, Haibo; Cao, Jinde			Robust state estimation for uncertain stochastic bidirectional associative memory networks with time-varying delays	PHYSICA SCRIPTA												In this paper, we investigate the problem of robust state estimation for uncertain stochastic bidirectional associative memory (BAM) networks with time-varying delays. BAM networks are quite general and include parameter uncertainties, time-varying delays and stochastic disturbances. The activation functions are allowed to satisfy sector-like nonlinearities. The main purpose of investigating this problem is to design a linear estimator to approximate the state of the networks through available measurement outputs. By using the Lyapunov functional method and some stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be checked easily by the Matlab toolbox. It is also shown that the designed state estimator can guarantee the estimation error dynamics to be globally robustly asymptotically stable in the mean square. Two illustrated examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed estimation schemes.

J	Li, Z; Chen, GR				Li, Z; Chen, GR			Robust adaptive synchronization of uncertain dynamical networks	PHYSICS LETTERS A												This Letter studies local and global robust adaptive synchronizations in uncertain dynamical networks. For complex dynamical networks with unknown but bounded nonlinear couplings, with known or unknown bounds, some robust adaptive controllers are designed in this Letter, which can ensure that the state of a dynamical network locally or globally asymptotically synchronize with an arbitrarily assigned state of an isolate node of the network. The Letter also investigates the synchronization problem where the dynamics of the coupled states are different from that of the uncoupled states. The key idea is to suitably combine the Lyapunov stability theory with a good update law for estimating the unknown network coupling parameters in the design of the controllers. Two examples are simulated, using the smooth chaotic Chen system and the piecewise-continuous chaotic Chua circuit, respectively, as the nodes of the dynamical network, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers design methods.

Since it is assumed that only the terminal output is measurable, a terminal output tracking error model is derived to design the adaptive terminal iterative learning controller by using a system input and output algebraic function as well as the differential mean value theorem. Based on a derived terminal output tracking error model, a fuzzy neural network is applied to approximate the unknown desired terminal iterative learning controller and an iteration-varying boundary layer is used to compensate for the corresponding function approximation error. Since the optimal fuzzy neural parameters for a good approximation and the optimal boundary layer for the fuzzy neural approximation error are in general unknown, an auxiliary terminal error function is derived for the design of adaptive laws. Based on a Lyapunov like analysis, we show that the boundedness of control parameters and control input are guaranteed for each iteration. Furthermore, the norm of terminal output error will asymptotically converge to a tunable residual set whose size depends on the width of boundary layer as iteration number goes to infinity.

Wireless networks strive to avoid scheduling multiple transmissions at the same time in order to prevent interference. This paper adopts the opposite approach; it encourages strategically picked senders to interfere. Instead of forwarding packets, routers forward the interfering signals. The destination leverages network-level information to cancel the interference and recover the signal destined to it. The result is analog network coding because it mixes signals not bits. So, what if wireless routers forward signals instead of packets? Theoretically, such an approach doubles the capacity of the canonical 2-way relay network. Surprisingly, it is also practical. We implement our design using software radios and show that it achieves significantly higher throughput than both traditional wireless routing and prior work on wireless network coding.																			0146-4833	1943-5819				OCT	2007	37	4					397	408		10.1145/1282427.1282425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1282427.1282425													WOS:000249927800036

Moreover, two discrete-time ZNN models are developed and investigated to solve the problem of time-varying linear equations (TVLE). Such discrete-time ZNN models can exploit methodologically the time derivatives of time-varying coefficients and the theoretical inverse of the time-varying coefficient matrix. When the time-varying coefficient matrix is positive-definite and symmetric, the BFGS quasi-Newton method is introduced to eliminate the explicit matrix-inversion operation. Thus, two other discrete-time ZNN models combined with the BFGS quasi-Newton method (i.e., ZNN-BFGS) are proposed and investigated for TVLE solving. In addition, according to the criterion whether the time-derivative information of time-varying coefficients is explicitly known/used or not, these proposed discrete-time models are investigated in two categories: 1) the models with time-derivative information known (i.e., ZNN-K and ZNN-BFGS-K models); and 2) the models with time-derivative information unknown (i.e., ZNN-U and ZNN-BFGS-U models). Two illustrated examples verify the efficacy of these proposed models for TVLE solving.

Mixed-line-rate (MLR) networks that support lightpaths of different rates such as 10, 40, 100 Gb/s, etc., are being studied to better support the heterogeneous traffic demands. Here, we study the important topic of degraded services in MLR networks, where a service can accept some degradation (i.e., reduction) in bandwidth in case of a failure in exchange for a lower cost, a concept called partial protection. Network operators may wish to support degraded services to optimize network resources and reduce cost. We propose using multipath routing to support degraded services in MLR networks, a problem that has not been studied before and is significantly more challenging than in single-line-rate (SLR) networks. We consider minimum-cost MLR network design (i.e., choosing which transponder rates to use at each node), considering the opportunity to exploit multipath routes to support degraded services. We propose a mixed-integer-linear-program (MILP) solution and a computationally efficient heuristic, and consider two partial-protection models. Our illustrative numerical results show that significant cost savings can be achieved due to partial protection versus full protection and is highly beneficial for network operators. We also note that multipath routing in MLR networks exploits volume discount of higher-line-rate transponders by cost-effectively grooming requests over appropriate line rates to maximize transponder reuse versus SLR.

The theoretically calculated continuous class E/F loads defined at the current source reference plane (CRP) may not guarantee feasible loads at the extrinsic package reference plane (ERP) due to nonlinear parasitic. Hence, a design space is analyzed to map the correct mode of the class E/F continuum over broadband to obtain feasible loads. A scheme is presented to assign fundamental current component (phi) to various frequencies over the band to obtain a tradeoff between best bandwidth and feasibility of a passive matching network. A nonlinear embedding model is used to project the loads from CRP to ERP. As a proof of concept, a continuous class E/F PA is designed using CGH27015F. The prototype developed has measured a drain efficiency of 60.2%-76.5% from 1.5 to 2.9 GHz which corresponds to 63.6% fractional bandwidth.

Given an integer p >_ 1, a p-uniform mixed strategy is a mixed strategy in which an agent plays exactly p edge-disjoint paths with uniform probability; therefore, a p-uniform mixed equilibrium is a tuple of p-uniform mixed strategies, one for each agent, in which no agent can lower her cost by deviating to another p-uniform mixed strategy. For games with weighted agents and affine latency functions, we show the existence of p-uniform mixed equilibria and provide a tight characterization of their price of anarchy. For games with unweighted agents, we extend the existential guarantee to any class of latency functions, and restricted to games with affine latencies, we derive a tight characterization of the price of anarchy and the price of stability.																			0364-765X	1526-5471				FEB	2024	49	1								10.1287/moor.2023.1365	http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/moor.2023.1365		APR 2023											WOS:000975431500001

Adaptive neural network-based optimal control of nonlinear continuous-time systems in strict-feedback form	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING												This paper focuses on neural network (NN) based optimal control of nonlinear continuous-time systems in strict-feedback form when the system dynamics are known by using an adaptive backstepping approach. A single NN-based adaptive approach is designed to learn the solution of the infinite horizon continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation while the corresponding optimal control input that minimizes the HJB equation is calculated in a forward-in-time manner without using value and policy iterations. First, the optimal control problem is solved for a generic multi-input and multi-output nonlinear system with a state feedback approach. Then the approach is extended to a single-input and single-output nonlinear system by using output feedback via a nonlinear observer. Lyapunov techniques are used to show that all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and that the approximated control signals approach the optimal control inputs with small bounded error both for the state and output feedback-based controller designs. In the absence of NN reconstruction errors, asymptotic convergence to the optimal control is demonstrated. Finally, simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical results.

It is an online control method which bases on actual data rather than a precise mathematical model of the system. This method is suitable for the optimal control of nonlinear systems, and can avoid the problem of dimension disaster. It can effectively solve the non-linearity of the plant or the uncertainty problem caused by the uncertainty of the system modeling. So, it is suitable for processing the complex system and task of time-varying. The heating section of the continuous annealing furnace consumes a large number of energy, and the dynamic programming method has some limitation for solve the problems. We design the optimization controller for the heating section of the annealing furnace based on the approximate dynamic programming method. In this paper, it mainly gives the basic structure and algorithm of the action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming method (ADHDP), and designs the temperature optimization controller of the heating section in the continuous annealing furnace based on the ADHDP method. Simulation shows the temperature controller based on ADHDP has some theoretical and practical significance for the future practical application.																					978-1-4244-4794-7				2009							353	358		10.1109/ICAL.2009.5262900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2009.5262900													WOS:000291503400066

In this paper, we propose an identification scheme for nonlinear discrete-time systems using fuzzy systems that takes the specific internal structure of the fuzzy system explicitly into consideration. We first design a fuzzy system and give the upper bound of its approximation error to a general nonlinear function. Then we propose a projection algorithm to turn the parameters in the fuzzy identification model and prove that the parameter error is nonincreasing and the identification error converges to an error band which can be made arbitrarily small by properly designing the fuzzy system. We also determine conditions under which the parameters converge.																			0743-1619		0-7803-4530-4				1998							1864	1865																WOS:000075568200395
