ONNs can be of interest as an ultra-low-power neuromorphic architecture capable of performing associative memory tasks, such as pattern recognition in IoT edge devices. To explore the benefits and costs of beyond-CMOS ONNs necessitates modeling, simulation, and design methods spanning from materials (e.g., atomistic methods) to devices (e.g., technology-computer-aided-design, TCAD) up to circuits (e.g., mixed-mode simulation, compact modeling). In this work, we report on the development of such an advanced design toolbox and the results on performance and features of beyond-CMOS ONNs. The proposed design toolbox allows exploring ONN scalability, accuracy, energy, and performance for pattern recognition applications.					; Todri-Sanial, Aida/M-5156-2013; Carapezzi, Stefania/Q-7779-2017	Karg, Siegfried/0000-0001-9873-2717; Todri-Sanial, Aida/0000-0001-8573-2910; nejim, ahmed/0000-0001-7656-5874; Corti, Elisabetta/0000-0003-4578-7639; Delacour, Corentin/0000-0001-6386-9588; Boschetto, Gabriele/0000-0001-8830-3572; Carapezzi, Stefania/0000-0002-9271-1189													2156-3357	2156-3365				DEC	2021	11	4					586	596		10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3128756	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3128756													WOS:000730514000009

The activation functions are assumed to be globally Lipschitz continuous. For the robust stabilization problem, a state feedback controller is designed to ensure global robust stability of the closed-loop system about its equilibrium point for all admissible uncertainties, while for the robust H-infinity control problem attention is focused on the design of a state feedback controller Such that in addition to the requirement of the global robust stability, a prescribed H-infinity performance level for all delays to satisfy both the lower bound and upper bound of the interval time-varying delay is also required to be achieved. A linear matrix inequality approach is developed to solve these problems. It is shown that the desired state feedback controller can be constructed by solving certain LMIs.

For example, some researchers propose RNN models to deal with such problems. Typical discrete time-variant problems, such as discrete time-variant matrix inversion, are developed from continuous time-variant problems. In the present paper, an efficient and straightforward method is proposed to solve discrete time-variant matrix inversion, note that it can skip the solving procedures of continuous time -variant problem and solves matrix inversion directly in the discrete time-variant environment. Specifically, an innovative discrete time-variant recurrent neural network (I-DT-RNN) model for dealing with discrete time-variant matrix inversion is proposed, furthermore it is mathematically founded on the second-order Taylor expansion. The theoretical analysis results of I-DT-RNN model are also presented, which proves that the proposed I-DT-RNN model has a reasonable characteristic and also shows that the proposed I-DT-RNN model has an excellent computational performance. Moreover, in the numerical experiments part, we present three different matrices as numerical experiment examples and an application of two-link robot manipulator as an industrial example for validating the practicability of the I-DT-RNN model.

Required inputs are generally obtained from borehole data to obtain representative values at the tunnel depth, but with limited opportunities for ground truthing and validation. Results are presented from a validation exercise comparing DFN results from discontinuity data sampled across two different spatial scales, first from a deep geotechnical borehole followed by a co-located deep shaft. The results indicate that both under- and over-sampling of different discontinuity sets occurs due to orientation bias and trace visibility. The corrections and workflow developed demonstrate the utility of continuous data collection and updating of DFN analyses as projects transition from investigation and design to construction.																					978-1-003-34803-0				2023							235	243		10.1201/9781003348030-29	http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003348030-29													WOS:001150380200029

This is mainly due to the highly nonlinear compression power constraint and the nonconvexities of the problem. To decrease the nonlinearities, we propose in this work a concept of pres -sure discretization, and therein the pressure variables of new makeup compressors make discrete choices among the specified pressures of hydrogen origin and destination units. Based on this concept, the con-straint of compression power is linearized without losing rigors. Then, hydrogen networks design is for-mulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming model that is applicable to both grass-roots synthesis and retrofit problems. We develop a global optimization algorithm to solve the proposed model to global optimality. Two grass-roots synthesis and three retrofit examples are tested for illustration purposes. The total annualized cost and computing time of our solutions compare favorably to those of literature solutions. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Novel Robust Digital Design of a Network of Industrial Continuous Cooling Crystallizers of Dextrose Monohydrate: From Laboratory Experiments to Industrial Application	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												This paper presents the first-ever industrial application of the digital design of a complex, large-scale industrial continuous crystallization network. The aim of the work is to optimize a large-scale continuous crystallization network used for the purification of dextrose monohydrate, by introducing a novel robust model-based digital design framework with the objective to minimize the fine index of the product size distribution, by re-adjusting the key operating parameters such as feed concentration, cooling profile, and recirculation strategy, for the current process as well as for the technically feasible configurations. The system consists of a complex network of over 40 large-scale continuous crystallizers operated in parallel as well as in cascade of multiple stages. The product quality attribute is the fine index, which represents the mass fraction of crystals under 75 mu m. The considered crystallization mechanisms are secondary nucleation and crystal growth, also accounting for growth inhibition by higher polymerization degree sugars. The nucleation and growth rate parameters were re-estimated based on laboratory-scale crystallization experiments. Uncertainty analysis and robust optimization were performed to provide design and operating condition recommendations, and the key outcomes were validated using scaled-down laboratory experiments. The optimizations and the experimental results revealed that, under the investigated conditions, the crystal fine index can be improved more significantly by applying recirculation from the last stage to the first-level crystallizers of the cascade, than by adding more active volume or increase residence time. The results aligned well with the company's process experience, including observations in another plant, and gave enough technical support to initiate the change in current operating conditions of the industrial system.

A periodically intermittent control protocol is designed to guarantee the exponential synchronization between two MINNs. Then, by adopting nonsmooth analysis, Halanay inequality, and Lyapunov theory, the exponential synchronization criteria for MINNs under the proposed controller are obtained.

Philip			Inference-Based Posteriori Parameter Distribution Optimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS												Encouraging the agent to explore has always been an important and challenging topic in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). Distributional representation for network parameters or value functions is usually an effective way to improve the exploration ability of the RL agent. However, directly changing the representation form of network parameters from fixed values to function distributions may cause algorithm instability and low learning inefficiency. Therefore, to accelerate and stabilize parameter distribution learning, a novel inference-based posteriori parameter distribution optimization (IPPDO) algorithm is proposed. From the perspective of solving the evidence lower bound of probability, we, respectively, design the objective functions for continuous-action and discrete-action tasks of parameter distribution optimization based on inference. In order to alleviate the overestimation of the value function, we use multiple neural networks to estimate value functions with Retrace, and the smaller estimate participates in the network parameter update; thus, the network parameter distribution can be learned. After that, we design a method used for sampling weight from network parameter distribution by adding an activation function to the standard deviation of parameter distribution, which achieves the adaptive adjustment between fixed values and distribution. Furthermore, this IPPDO is a deep RL (DRL) algorithm based on off-policy, which means that it can effectively improve data efficiency by using off-policy techniques such as experience replay. We compare IPPDO with other prevailing DRL algorithms on the OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo platforms. Experiments on both continuous-action and discrete-action tasks indicate that IPPDO can explore more in the action space, get higher rewards faster, and ensure algorithm stability.

Model-Free Dual Heuristic Dynamic Programming	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												Model-based dual heuristic dynamic programming (MB-DHP) is a popular approach in approximating optimal solutions in control problems. Yet, it usually requires offline training for the model network, and thus resulting in extra computational cost. In this brief, we propose a model-free DHP (MF-DHP) design based on finite-difference technique. In particular, we adopt multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer for both the action and the critic networks design, and use delayed objective functions to train both the action and the critic networks online over time. We test both the MF-DHP and MB-DHP approaches with a discrete time example and a continuous time example under the same parameter settings. Our simulation results demonstrate that the MF-DHP approach can obtain a control performance competitive with that of the traditional MB-DHP approach while requiring less computational resources.

Traditional source coding methods are usually designed based on the statistical distribution of symbols generated by the information source. Notice that, in content-centric networks, the user preference has a significant impact on the statistical distribution of symbols transmitted in the links. This paper presents an edge source coding method to compress data in the network edge. An optimization problem is formulated to obtain the optimal codebook design. Based on the solution of the single codebook case, an optimality condition for the optimization problem is presented. For discrete user preferences, a variant of the k-means++ algorithm is used to give a suboptimal solution. For continuous user preferences, two algorithms are proposed to give codebook designs. Both theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the optimal codebook design should take into account the user preferences.					Chen, Wei/E-6592-2015; Poor, H. Vincent/S-5027-2016	Poor, H.

Multistability of Delayed Hybrid Impulsive Neural Networks With Application to Associative Memories	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												The important topic of multistability of continuous- and discrete-time neural network (NN) models has been investigated rather extensively. Concerning the design of associative memories, multistability of delayed hybrid NNs is studied in this paper with an emphasis on the impulse effects. Arising from the spiking phenomenon in biological networks, impulsive NNs provide an efficient model for synaptic interconnections among neurons. Using state-space decomposition, the coexistence of multiple equilibria of hybrid impulsive NNs is analyzed. Multistability criteria are then established regrading delayed hybrid impulsive neurodynamics, for which both the impulse effects on the convergence rate and the basins of attraction of the equilibria are discussed. Illustrative examples are given to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate an application to the design of associative memories. It is shown by an experimental example that delayed hybrid impulsive NNs have the advantages of high storage capacity and high fault tolerance when used for associative memories.

The main merit of this filter-based fault detection method is that it can significantly improve the robustness of FDF to attenuate influences from external disturbance, channel fading and model uncertainty on fault detection accuracy. Designing such FDF involves three main stages. First of all, a memory scheduling FDF structure is proposed based on the utilisation of weighted historical filter's states over interval instants, and a residual error system is formulated based on time partition and state augmented approaches. Then, the parameter-dependent Lyapunov method is further utilised to analyse the stochastic stability of the residual error system with the help of Finsler equivalent transformation. In the following, a two-stage optimisation algorithm combined with scalar parameters method is constructed to design memory scheduling FDF in a less conservative linear matrix inequality manner. Finally, a random numerical verification with 300 test systems and a case study of an industrial continuous-stirred tank reactor are exploited to show the effectiveness of obtained results.

The EL system considered here is connected to the controller over a shared communication network. The event-based SMC is designed to ensure the reduced usage of the communication and computational resources with robust tracking performance. The controller is designed under the assumption that the EL system dynamics are unknown; thus, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used to estimate it. The discrete weight update dynamics of RBFNN is formulated for a continuous-time EL system which makes the closed-loop system hybrid. Hence, the stability of the closed-loop system is investigated using the theory of impulsive dynamical systems with the admissible inter sampling time. Finally, a numerical example of an EL system is simulated to establish the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

Here, we introduce a complementary framework, providing a mathematically rigorous weighted graph construction that exactly realizes any desired spectrum. We illustrate the broad applicability of this approach by showing how designer spectra can be used to control the dynamics of various archetypal physical systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that a strategically placed gap induces generalized chimera states in Kuramoto-type oscillator networks, tunes or suppresses pattern formation in a generic Swift-Hohenberg model, and leads to persistent localization in a discrete Gross-Pitaevskii quantum network. Our approach can be generalized to design continuous band gaps through periodic extensions of finite networks.

One subcategory of microfluidic is droplet-based microfluidic, which disperse discrete volumes of fluids into a continuous stream of another immiscible fluid, which act as droplet carrier. Droplets can then be moved, merged, split, or processed in many other ways by suitably managing the hydrodynamic parameters of the LoC. A very interesting research challenge consists in developing basic microfluidic structures able to interconnect specialized LoCs by means of a flexible and modular microfluidic network. The aim of this paper is to exploit the properties of droplet-based microfluidics to realize purely hydrodynamic microfluidic elements that provide basic networking functionalities, such as addressing and switching. We define some simple mathematical models that capture the macroscopic behavior of droplets in microfluidic networks and use such models to design and analyze a simple microfluidic network system with bus topology.																			2164-7038		978-1-4673-5753-1				2013							798	803																WOS:000572825900153

We give a continuous non-linear formulation that integrates location, allocation and inventory decisions, and includes the costs of transportation, cycle inventory, safety stock, ordering and facility opening. Then, relying on the fact that the model becomes linear when certain variables are fixed, we propose a heuristic algorithm that solves the resulting linear program and uses the solution to improve the variable estimations for the next iteration. In order to show the efficiency of the algorithm, we compare our results with those of the conic quadratic formulation of the problem. Computational experiments show that the heuristic algorithm can be efficiently used to find fast and close to optimal solutions for large supply chain networks. Finally, we provide managerial insights regarding the ways in which demand uncertainty, risk pooling and safety stocks at retailers affect the design of a supply chain. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A pinning impulsive control strategy, in which only a small portion of nodes are impulsively controlled, is designed to achieve finite-time synchronization for NCDNs on time scales. Based on the theory of time scales, Lyapunov method and mathematical induction approach, a finite-time synchronization criterion is obtained for NCDNs on time scales under the pinning impulsive control strategy. It is shown that the finite-time synchronization criterion in this paper is different from that derived for continuous-time or discrete-time NCDNs. Moreover, the idea of this paper provides a unified approach to study the finite-time synchronization problems for continuous-time NCDNs and their discrete-time counterparts simultaneously. A numerical simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our result. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The interval distributed time-varying delay including the lower and upper bound is comprehensively established, which developed from the previous work. The following techniques are utilize to analyze the appropriate criteria for the modified function projective synchronization problem for master-slave neural networks with mixed interval time-varying delays such as the construction of appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals merged with Newton-Leibniz formulation method, the intermittent feedback control technique, the reciprocally convex technique's lower bound lemma, Jensen's inequality, and the piecewise analytic method. The sufficient criteria for the modified function projective synchronization of the error system between the master and slave neural networks with intermittent feedback control are first established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The designed controller ensures that the synchronization of the error systems are proposed via intermittent feedback control. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The concept of system-on-package (SOP) originated in the mid-1990s at the NSF-funded Packaging Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This can be thought of as a conceptual paradigm in which the package, and not the bulky board, as the system and the package provides all the system functions in one single module, not as an assemblage of discrete components to be connected together, but as a continuous merging of various integrated thin film technologies in a small package. In the SOP concept, this is accomplished by codesign and fabrication of digital, optical, RF and sensor functions in both IC and the package, thus distinguishing between what function is accomplished best at IC level and at package level. In this paradigm, IC's are viewed as being best for transistor density while the package is viewed as being best for RF, optical and certain digital-function integration. The SOP concept is demonstrated for a conceptual broad-band system called an intelligent network communicator (INC). Its testbed acts as both a leading-edge research and teaching platform in which students, faculty, research scientists, and member companies evaluate the validity of SOP technology from design to fabrication to integration, test, cost and reliability. The testbed explores optical bit stream switching up to 100 GHz, digital signals up to 5-20 GHz, decoupling capacitor integration concepts to reduce simultaneous switching noise of power beyond 100 W/chip, design,. modeling and fabrication of embedded components for RF, microwave, and millimeter wave applications up to 60 GHz. This article reviews a number of SOP technologies which have been developed and integrated into SOP test bed.. These are 1) convergent SOP-based INC system design and architecture, 2) digital SOP and its fabrication for signal and power integrity, 3) optical SOP fabrication with embedded actives and passives, 4) RF SOP for high Q-embedded inductors, filters and other RF components, 5) mixed signal electrical test, 6) mixed signal reliability, and 7) demonstration of SOP by INC prototype system.																			1521-3323					MAY	2004	27	2					250	267		10.1109/TADVP.2004.830353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2004.830353													WOS:000223599100003

Robust state estimation for stochastic complex-valued neural networks with sampled-data	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS												In this paper, the robust state estimation problem is investigated for the complex-valued neural networks involving parameter uncertainties, mixed time delays, as well as stochastic disturbances by resorting to the sampled-data information from the available output measurements. The parameter uncertainties are assumed to be norm-bounded and the stochastic disturbances are assumed to be Brownian motions, which could reflect much more realistic dynamical behaviors of the complex-valued network under a noisy environment. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design an estimator for the complex-valued network such that, for all admissible parameter uncertainties and sampled output measurements, the dynamics of the state estimation error system is assured to be globally asymptotically stable in the mean square. Matrix inequality approach, robust analysis tool, as well as stochastic analysis techniques are utilized together to derive several delay-dependent sufficient criteria guaranteeing the existence of the desired state estimator. Finally, simulation examples are illustrated to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed estimation design schemes.

Recently, many researchers have shifted the focus of traditional optimization methods to the use of metaheuristic approaches for handling this complexity. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the evolutionary algorithms which was developed for optimization problems with continuous variables. Also it has been adapted successfully in other problems contexts with discrete variables. In this research, a simple modified particle swarm optimization (SMPSO) was applied to minimize water distribution networks cost. The SMPSO was used as novel factor to decrease inertia weight linearly with time for each iteration to facilitate the balance of global and local researches. The SMPSO algorithm was linked to a hydraulic simulator, EPANET 2.0. This approach was applied to three benchmark in water distribution network optimization problems. The results indicate that a significant improvement in performance of PSO could be achieved by decreasing inertia weight over the iterations.

For the sake of technical simplicity, only two different sampling periods are considered, their occurrence probabilities are given constants and satisfy Bernoulli distribution, and they can be extended to the case with multiple stochastic sampling periods. By using an input-delay method, the probabilistic system is transformed into a stochastic continuous time-delay system. A new linear matrix inequality(LMI)-based procedure is proposed for designing state-feedback controllers, which would guarantee that the closed-loop networked system with stochastic sampling tracks the output of a given reference model well in the sense of H (a). Conservatism is reduced by taking the probability into account. Both network-induced delays and packet dropouts have been considered. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed H (a) output tracking design.

We develop and use a variant of a simulation based two timescale simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm for finding an optimal feedback policy within the class of threshold type policies. Even though SPSA has originally been designed for continuous parameter optimization, its variant for the discrete parameter case is seen to work well.

On the other way, future matrix pseudoinverse (FMP), as a more challenging and intractable discrete-time problem, deserves more attention due to its significant role-playing on some engineering applications, such as redundant manipulator. Based on the zeroing neural network (ZNN), this article concentrates on designing new discrete ZNN models appropriately for computing the FMPs of all matrices of full rank, including the Zhang matrix. First, an inverse-free continuous ZNN model for computing TVMP is derived. Subsequently, Zhang et al discretization (ZeaD) formulas and equidistant extrapolation formulas are used to discretize the continuous ZNN model to two discrete ZNN models for computing FMPs with different truncation errors. The numerical experiments are conducted for the five conventional discrete models and two new discrete ZNN models. Distinct numerical results substantiate the effectiveness and choiceness of newly proposed models. Finally, one of the newly proposed models is implemented on simulating and physical instances of robot manipulators, respectively, to show its practicability.

J	Wang, SA				Wang, Shuaian			Essential elements in tactical planning models for container liner shipping	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												Tactical planning models for liner shipping problems such as network design and fleet deployment usually minimize the total cost or maximize the total profit subject to constraints including ship availability, service frequency, ship capacity, and transshipment. Most models in the literature do not consider slot-purchasing, multi-type containers, empty container repositioning, or ship repositioning, and they formulate the numbers of containers to transport as continuous variables. This paper develops a mixed-integer linear programming model that captures all these elements. It further examines from the theoretical point of view the additional computational burden introduced by incorporating these elements in the planning model. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the effects of the elements on tactical planning decisions. Results demonstrate that slot-purchasing and empty container repositioning have the largest impact on tactical planning decisions and relaxing the numbers of containers as continuous variables has little impact on the decisions.

In this study, we considered a four-stage global supply chain and designed the network with the objectives of maximizing profit and minimizing disruption risk. We quantified and modeled disruption risk as a function of the geographic diversification of facilities called supply density (evaluated based on the interstage distance between nodes) to mitigate the risk caused by disruptions. Furthermore, we developed a bi-criteria mixed-integer linear programming model for designing the supply chain in order to maximize profit and supply density. We propose an interactive fuzzy optimization algorithm that generates efficient frontiers by systematically taking decision-maker inputs and solves the bi-criteria model problem in the context of a realistic example. We also conducted disruption analysis using a discrete set of disruption scenarios to determine the advantages of the network design from the bi-criteria model over the traditional profit maximization model. Our study demonstrates that the network design from the bi-criteria model has a 2% higher expected profit and a 2.2% lower profit variance under disruption than the traditional profit maximization solution. We envisage that this model will help firms evaluate the trade-offs between mitigation benefits and mitigation costs.

Current constructions of automotive structures are based on single types of materials, e.g., steel or aluminium. The principle of the multi-material construction concept is that proper materials are selected for their intended functions. The design problem is formulated as a multi-objective nonlinear mathematical programming problem involving both discrete and continuous variables. The discrete variables are the material types and continuous variables are the thicknesses of the panels. This problem is then solved using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. An artificial neural network is employed to approximate the constraint functions and reduce the number of finite element runs. The proposed method is illustrated through a case study of lightweight design of an automotive door assembly. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Two impulsive control algorithms containing time-varying delays are designed, under which the frequency and voltage restoration and active power sharing accuracy of all distributed generators can be realised with an exponential convergence speed. Compared to the traditional continuous or discrete-time distributed algorithms, the designed impulsive controllers formulate the controlled MG to be a hybrid dynamics, which are more general and applicable for practical power systems. Moreover, some delay-dependent sufficient conditions on the requirements for sparse communication network and impulsive time intervals are derived, in which the time delays do not need to be less than the length of the impulsive intervals. Simulation results on the control parameter analysis, and communication network topologies validates the developed theories.

However, the optimum design of these networks is cumbersome and sophisticated; due to these systems' sensitive and costly construction, the application of optimization algorithms is essential. Focusing on solving this nonlinear optimization problem with continuous and discrete constraints, the shuffled gray wolf optimizer (SGWO), which is a hybrid algorithm inspired by shuffled complex evolution (SCE) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO), was used to solve two hypothetical networks and one real sewer network with different scales and geometries and was compared to four well-known metaheuristic optimization algorithms. The results showed that the population division in the SGWO algorithm not only improved the results obtained by the GWO and other algorithms but also the costs were lower than those achieved using other famous optimization algorithms.

However, the limitation of applications occurred since the stochastic neurosystem could execute only discrete-time dynamics. We have contrived a neuron model with continuous-time dynamics by using stochastic calculations. In this paper, we propose the circuit design of a new neuron circuit, and show the fabricated neurochip comprising 64 neurons with experimental results. Furthermore, a new asynchronous updating method and a new activation function circuit are proposed. These improvements enhance the performance of the neurochip greatly.

J	Han, P; Shang, JD; Pan, JS				Han, Pu; Shang, Jiandong; Pan, Jeng-Shyang			A Convolution Location Method for Multi-Node Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks	ELECTRONICS												The localization of continuous objects and the scheduling of resources are challenging issues in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to the irregular shape of the continuous target area and the sensor deployment in WSNs, the sensor data are always discrete and sparse, and most network resources are also limited by the node energy. To achieve faster detection and tracking of continuous objects, we propose a convolution-based continuous object localization algorithm (named CCOL). Moreover, we implement the idea of greedy and dynamic programming to design an energy-saving and efficient strategy model (named MSSM) to respond to emergencies caused by multiple continuous targets in most specific WSNs. The simulation experiments demonstrate that CCOL is superior to other localization algorithms in terms of time complexity and execution performance. Furthermore, the feasibility of the multinode scheduling strategy is verified by setting different mobile nodes to respond to the target area in certain green WSNs.

By introducing triple-integral terms and quadruple integrals term in Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the obtained Lyapunov matrices are distinct for different system modes. Based on the nonsmooth analysis theory and by applying stochastic analysis techniques, the full-order state estimator is designed to ensure that the corresponding error system is exponentially stable in mean square.

The NCS is modelled as a sampled-data system with time-delay in its discrete-time subsystem. This model is able to capture many network-induced features, for example, time-delay and packet dropout. Moreover, the model allows different combinations of the time-driven or event-driven mode of the devices, including the samplers, the controllers and the holders. By transforming time-delay in the discrete-time subsystem into its continuous-time subsystem of the sampled-data system, we have also obtained a less conservative time-delay dependent stability result for the NCSs, using a new Lyapunov function and a relaxed condition. Some limitations of the existing literatures on network-induced time-delay and sampling period are removed in the proposed framework. Furthermore, a sampled-data control design procedure is developed for the NCSs. Linear matrix inequality approach has been employed to solve the stability and control design problems. Finally, numerical examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability result and the potential of the proposed techniques. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Strategic design of competing supply chain networks for inelastic demand	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY												A model for designing the network of a new entrant supply chain under inelastic demand and in the presence of pre-existing competing chains is proposed. These supply chains provide an identical product for a market area. The model considers the location of distribution centres and retail outlets on a discrete set of potential locations. The assumptions of the model are: (1) static competition between the new and pre-existing chains and (2) a probabilistic customer behaviour based on an attraction function depending on both the location and the quality of the retailers. This model also incorporates the impact of the facilities' location decisions on the operational inventory and shipment decisions. The resulting model is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programme (MINLP). To solve the MINLP it is transformed to a linear one. We illustrate the model, discuss the results of a real-world case, and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using randomly generated examples.

Compared with the traditional asphalt-treated base (ATB), LSPM forms a more obvious skeleton structure in the process of bearing load. In this study, the discrete element method (DEM) model of LSPM is established, and an evaluation method for studying the bearing capacity and high-temperature performance of LSPM through an internal skeleton network is proposed. Firstly, the DEM model of asphalt mixture with different gradations is established, and the virtual uniaxial penetration test is carried out. Then, the performance of the skeleton network inside the asphalt mixture is analyzed, and the contribution of each group of aggregates to the skeleton network is further studied. The experimental results show that the bearing capacity of an asphalt mixture is closely related to the performance of internal skeleton network. The skeleton network inside the asphalt mixture is extracted by the value of the contact force, the angle between the contacts, and the contact continuity. When the skeleton network has better bearing capacity and load-transfer capacity, the asphalt mixture can bear more external load in the virtual penetration test. The contribution of different coarse aggregates to the skeleton network is analyzed from four perspectives: total contact force, vertical work, contact number, and effective coordination number. The aggregates of 19-26.5 and 4.75-9.5 mm constitute the main body of the load-transfer path and play a major role in bearing and transmitting the load in the skeleton network.																			0899-1561	1943-5533				APR 1	2024	36	4							04024039	10.1061/JMCEE7.MTENG-17512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/JMCEE7.MTENG-17512													WOS:001162757400022

Cyber-physical power system is one of the heuristic systems tightly coupled by a continuous-time electrical power system and a discrete-time information system. The transmitting latency, packets disorder, or loss will fail system convergence, even unstable under disturbance. This article studies the effect of long latency on cyber-physical power system frequency stability based on network control theory and establishes a heuristic model to express the continuous-time distributed generation system and the discrete-time distributed sensor network. A new state feedback controller is designed based on the stochastic optimal control theory to solve the micro-grid's frequency stability problem with stochastic latency disturbance. Finally, we have conducted an extensive evaluation study using a real distributed generation micro-grid system. The simulation results show that the new controller reduces the influence of distributed sensor networks transmitting latency on the frequency stability, and the frequency dynamic process in the distributed generation micro-grid has smaller overshoot and obtains faster dynamic response speed.																			1550-1477					SEP 27	2018	14	9							1550147718802260	10.1177/1550147718802260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1550147718802260													WOS:000450833400001

In order to accommodate with intermittent connected and partitioned characteristics of satellite topology, disruption-tolerant network (DTN) develops a feasible solution for networking among such satellites. However, utilized widely and frequently in the future, numerous image covering hundreds of spectral bands and kilometers width is supposed to be delivered simultaneously. Due to the timeliness constrain, efficient routing design with minimum delivery delay for bulk and concurrent image data has become the bottleneck of remote sensing application. Considering data transmission initiated as different tasks, therefore, the Task-driven Updated Discrete Graph (TUDG) is designed to depict the topology evolution, with task data and edge capacity model for BP/LTP incorporated Remote Sensing DTN Network (RS-DTNet). In particular, the multitask-based delivery delay analytical framework is proposed based on the TUDG graph model, by solving a mixed integer Max-Min optimization problem. The Multi-Task Minimum Delay Routing (MTMDR) is designed with the delay-optimal flow distribution, dispatching appropriate bundle data to edges in the TUDG. This flow-based routing avoids the path selection procedure, which may degenerate the delivery delay performance. Through numerical simulation based on the representative RS-DTNet scene, the proposed MTMDR routing strategy shows to advantage on delivery delay, compared with typical path-based routing.

The objective is to optimally trade off between the user coverage performance and the net energy loss of the network by proactively assigning UAVs to serve, charge, or land. Specifically, the studied problem is first formulated into a time-coupled mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, and further decoupled into two sub-problems for tractability. To solve the challenge caused by time-coupling, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are respectively designed for the two sub-problems. Particularly, a relaxation mechanism is put forward to overcome the "dimension curse" incurred by the large discrete action space in the second sub-problem.

Mixed integer simulation optimization for optimal hydraulic fracturing and production of shale gas fields	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												Optimal development of shale gas fields involves designing a most productive fracturing network for hydraulic stimulation processes and operating wells appropriately throughout the production time. A hydraulic fracturing network designdetermining well placement, number of fracturing stages, and fracture lengthsis defined by specifying a set of integer ordered blocks to drill wells and create fractures in a discrete shale gas reservoir model. The well control variables such as bottom hole pressures or production rates for well operations are real valued. Shale gas development problems, therefore, can be mathematically formulated with mixed-integer optimization models. A shale gas reservoir simulator is used to evaluate the production performance for a hydraulic fracturing and well control plan. To find the optimal fracturing design and well operation is challenging because the problem is a mixed integer optimization problem and entails computationally expensive reservoir simulation. A dynamic simplex interpolation-based alternate subspace (DSIAS) search method is applied for mixed integer optimization problems associated with shale gas development projects. The optimization performance is demonstrated with the example case of the development of the Barnett Shale field. The optimization results of DSIAS are compared with those of a pattern search algorithm.

Discretisation and control of polytopic systems with uncertain sampling rates and network-induced delays	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL												This paper investigates the problems of uncertain sampling rate discretisation and the networked control of uncertain time-invariant continuous-time linear systems in polytopic domains. The sampling period is assumed to be unknown but belonging to a given interval. To avoid the difficulty of dealing with the exponential of uncertain matrices, a discrete-time model is obtained by applying a Taylor series expansion of degree l to the original system. The resulting discrete-time model is composed of homogeneous polynomial matrices with parameters lying in the Cartesian product of simplexes, called a multi-simplex, plus an additive norm-bounded term representing the discretisation residual error. The original continuous-time system is controlled through a communication network that introduces a time delay in the process. Linear matrix inequality relaxations that include a scalar parameter search are proposed for the design of a digital robust state feedback controller that guarantees the closed-loop stability of the networked control system. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the versatility of the proposed method, which can be applied to a more general class of networked control problems than the existing approaches in the literature.

Such a technique employs multilayer perceptrons to approximate the mapping between the sampling period/continuous-time parameters of the plant and the optimal values of the FROH parameter. The neural networks are designed to adapt on-line to changing system structures, parameter values and sampling periods, To achieve this objective, the network weighting coefficients are determined during an off-line training phase. In this training phase, the optimal values of the FROH parameter are obtained by applying the classical generalised root locus procedure. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the properties of the complete regression system.					de la Sen, manuel/A-8803-2008; Garrido, Aitor J./A-5725-2008; Barcena, Rafael/ABH-2041-2020	de la Sen, manuel/0000-0001-9320-9433; Barcena, Rafael/0000-0002-0799-5675													0743-1619	2378-5861	0-7803-6495-3				2001							3872	3877																WOS:000173663300691

For the Markov chain, the transition rates are assumed to be partly known. The involved mixed time delays comprise both time-varying delays and distributed delays. The logarithmic quantiser is introduced in the design of the state feedback controller and the uncertainty is entered into the quantization error matrix represented by an interval matrix. Based on the generalised Ito's formula, the free-connection weighting matrix method and the stochastic analysis theory, several novel sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the trivial solution of the closed-loop system is robustly exponentially stable in the mean square. Then, the concrete expression form of the desired controller gain is obtained via the solutions to a set of linear matrix inequalities. In addition, the corresponding stability criteria are given for three special situations of Markovian jump systems. Finally, a numerical example and a practical example (the wheeled mobile manipulator) are provided to show the feasibility and availability of the proposed theoretical results.

The high-order neural networks have simple structure and strong nonlinear approximation capability, which enables it to model the nonlinear singularly perturbed systems more accurately with less computation complexity, compared to multilayer neural networks. The optimal bounded ellipsoid algorithm, which is originally designed for discrete time systems, is introduced to update the weights of continuous multi-time scales neural networks. Compared to other widely used gradient-like updating methods, the on-line identification algorithm proposed in this paper can realize faster convergence, due to the adaptive "learning rate" of the weights updating laws. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.

In order to accurately describe discrete dynamical behaviors, we build a general model of discrete complex networks via T-S fuzzy rules, which extends a continuous-time model in existing results. Based on an adaptive threshold and measurement errors, a discrete adaptive event-triggered approach (AETA) is introduced to govern signal transmission. With the hope of improving the resource utilization and reducing the update frequency, an event-based fuzzy pinning feedback control strategy is designed to control a small fraction of network nodes. Furthermore, by new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and the finite-time analysis method, sufficient criteria are provided to guarantee the finite-time bounded stability of the closed-loop error system. Under an optimization condition and linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, the desired controller parameters with respect to minimum finite time are derived. Finally, several numerical examples are conducted to show the effectiveness of obtained theoretical results. For the same system, the average triggering rate of AETA is significantly lower than existing event-triggered mechanisms and the convergence rate of synchronization errors is also superior to other control strategies.

For the multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) architecture with multi-antenna base station, design and optimization of D2D communications underlaying such a network is an interesting research area that has not been fully investigated yet. In this paper, we consider a cellular network with multiple cellular user equipments (UEs) and multiple direct D2D pairs underlaying communications with a central base station equipped with multiple antennas. We generalize a joint optimization problem to maximize the overall rate of the cellular UEs and D2D pairs, with regard to the continuous beamforming vector design for all cellular UEs and the binary D2D pair association status search. In addition, to solve the mixed optimization problem approximately, we investigate three precoder design methods and propose a D2D pair association vector search algorithm. Simulation results show the performance gain under different precoder methods with the D2D association vector search algorithm.					qian, yi/HZH-4175-2023; Qian, Yi/KEI-0952-2024; wei, li/GSD-3630-2022; wei, li/ISB-3361-2023; 黎, 伟/GXM-4040-2022														2334-0983		978-1-4799-1353-4				2013							4902	4907																WOS:000357299605001

Simulation and timing analysis are poor tools for this task because they cannot be modified for better results. Hence, the method of Logical Effort (LE) provides a simple method to overcome these design problems. We apply a novel Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (DPSO) to solve the LE problem for electronic circuits. The method uses the rescaling function commonly used to scale datasets in neural networks to convert continuous-valued PSO values into discrete values. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied on a three-stage NAND gate circuit, and has been shown to work well, with 100% accuracy in all test runs.

Firstly, the NTMI-CMTVDNNs with SAI between neurons are modeled by a signed graph. Inertial network is equivalently transformed into the first-order differential equations via variable substitution. Secondly, a novel lemma is proposed to deal with param-eter mismatch of the above modeled network. By designing delay-dependent and delay-independent discontinuous control laws, the delay-dependent sufficient conditions under the bounded and unbounded activation functions are obtained to ensure the GEBS of the NTMI-CMTVDNNs with SAI with or without a leader neurons, respectively. Finally, two numerical simulation examples illustrate the validity of our theoretical results.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since the space consists of almost anti-periodic functions has no vector space structure, firstly, we prove that the network under consideration possesses a unique bounded continuous solution by using the contraction fixed point theorem. Then, by using the inequality technique, it was proved that the unique bounded continuous solution is also an almost anti-periodic solution. Secondly, taking the neural network that was considered as the driving system, introducing the corresponding response system and designing the appropriate controller, some sufficient conditions for the global exponential synchronization of the driving-response system were obtained by employing the inequality technique. When the system we consider degenerated into a real-valued system, our results were considered new. Finally, the validity of the results was verified using a numerical example.

By exploiting a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, using the Leibniz-Newton formula and a free-weighting matrix method, sufficient conditions for sampled-data H-infinity performance analysis and H-infinity controller design for such systems are given. Since the obtained conditions of H-infinity controller design are not expressed strictly in term of linear matrix inequalities, the sampled-data H-infinity controller is solved using modified cone complementary linearisation algorithm. In addition, the new sampled-data stability criteria for the NCSs is proved to be less conservative than some existing results. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.																			0020-7721	1464-5319					2012	43	9					1728	1740		10.1080/00207721.2010.550401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2010.550401													WOS:000306409300014
J	Joshi, H; Rosenbloom, PS; Ustun, V				Joshi, Himanshu; Rosenbloom, Paul S.; Ustun, Volkan			Continuous phone recognition in the Sigma cognitive architecture	BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES												Spoken language processing is an important capability of human intelligence that has hitherto been unexplored by cognitive architectures. This reflects on both the symbolic and sub-symbolic nature of the speech problem, and the capabilities provided by cognitive architectures to model the latter and its rich interplay with the former. Sigma has been designed to leverage the state-of-the-art hybrid (discrete + continuous) mixed (symbolic + probabilistic) capability of graphical models to provide in a uniform non-modular fashion effective forms of, and integration across, both cognitive and sub-cognitive behavior. In this article, previous work on speaker dependent isolated word recognition has been extended to demonstrate Sigma's feasibility to process a stream of fluent audio and recognize phones, in an online and incremental manner with speaker independence. Phone recognition is an important step in integrating spoken language processing into Sigma. This work also extends the acoustic front-end used in the previous work in service of speaker independence. All of the knowledge used in phone recognition was added supraarchitecturally- i.e. on top of the architecture- without requiring the addition of new mechanisms to the architecture.

Optimization models for operative planning in drinking water networks	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING												The topic of this paper is minimum cost operative planning of pressurized water supply networks over a finite horizon and under reliable demand forecast. Since this is a very hard problem, it is desirable to employ sophisticated mathematical algorithms, which in turn calls for carefully designed models with suitable properties. The paper develops a nonlinear mixed integer model and a nonlinear programming model with favorable properties for gradient-based optimization methods, based on smooth component models for the network elements. In combination with further nonlinear programming techniques (Burgschweiger et al. in ZIB Report ZR-05-31, Zuse Institute Berlin, 2005), practically satisfactory near-optimum solutions even for large networks can be generated in acceptable time using standard optimization software on a PC workstation.

Given a base network with only two-way links, and the candidate lane addition and link construction projects, the problem is to find the optimal combination of one-way and two-way links, the optimal selection of network capacity expansion projects, and the optimal lane allocations on two-way links to optimize the reserve capacity of the network, and two new travel time related performance measures. The problem is considered in two variations; in the first scenario, two-way links may have different numbers of lanes in each direction and in the second scenario, two-way links must have equal number of lanes in each direction. The proposed variations are formulated as mixed-integer programming problems with equilibrium constraints. A hybrid genetic algorithm, an evolutionary simulated annealing, and a hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm are proposed to solve these two new problems. A new measure is also proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of the three algorithms. Computational results for both problems are presented. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sampled-Data Adaptive NN Tracking Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS												In this paper, for a class of single-input-single-output (SISO) uncertain nonlinear systems, adaptive neural tracking controllers designed for digital computer implementation are proposed. The overall scheme can be considered as a sampled-data adaptive neural control system. As an intermediate result, it is proven that, for a sufficiently small sampling period, the emulated adaptive neural controller i.e., the discrete implementation of the continuous-time adaptive neural network controller ensures semiglobal uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system. Then, based on the exact discrete-time model, a controller redesign is proposed that performs efficiently for sampling periods for which the emulation controller fails. The redesigned controller consists of two terms: the emulated control law and an extra robustness term designed to increase the order of the perturbation (with respect to the sampling period) in the Lyapunov difference. In all cases, high-order neural networks are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinearities. Using Lyapunov techniques, it is proven that, for a sufficiently small sampling period, the proposed redesigned controller ensures the (semiglobal) boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop while the output of the system converges to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectory. Simulation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed scheme with respect to the emulation controller and verify the theoretical analysis.

We explore the dependence of the network on the thresholds that define the evolutionary relatedness of the domains. At excessively strict thresholds the network falls apart completely; for very lax thresholds, there are network paths between virtually all domains. Interestingly, at intermediate thresholds the network constitutes two regions that can be described as "continuous" versus "discrete." The continuous region comprises a large connected component, dominated by domains with alternating alpha and beta elements, and the discrete region includes the rest of the domains in isolated islands, each generally corresponding to a fold. We also construct the " motif network," in which nodes represent recurring motifs, and edges connect motifs that appear in the same domain. This network also features a large and highly connected component of motifs that originate from domains with alternating alpha/beta elements (and some all-alpha domains), and smaller isolated islands. Indeed, the motif network suggests that nature reuses such motifs extensively. The networks suggest evolutionary paths between domains and give hints about protein evolution and the underlying biophysics. They provide natural means of organizing protein space, and could be useful for the development of strategies for protein search and design.

The polytopic model of closed-loop synchronization error dynamics is established by considering the pattern characteristics of false data injection attacks and input delays, which has essentially different from the traditional handling method. More specifically, the proposed polytopic model utilizes the current state of the closed-loop synchronization error dynamics, thereby facilitating the reduction of possible conservatism. In such a framework, a nonlinear synchronization control method is developed to eliminate the negative impact of cyber attacks, and sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the closed-loop synchronization error dynamics are ultimately exponentially bounded. In the meanwhile, the design procedure of the synchronization controller is proposed for underlying complex cyber-physical networks subject to mixed delays and false data injection attacks. Finally, an illustrative example is delivered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.																			1454-8658						2023	25	3					3	14																WOS:001080469500001

By using a new discrete event-triggering mechanism, an event-based sampled-data three-layer fully connected feedforward neural-network-based controller is constructed. Compared with the conventional periodic sampled-data neural-network-based control in previous works, the main advantage of this paper is that the proposed event-based sampling and transmission scheme not only reduces the updating frequency of the controller, but also guarantees the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system without dramatically degrading the overall system performance. Based on a discontinuous Lyapunov Krasovskii functional, a convex combination technique and the Wirtinger-based integral inequality, some new criteria are derived to guarantee the asymptotical stability and certain performance of closed-loop system in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on the proposed criteria, a co-design method is presented to obtain the triggering parameter and the connection weights of the neural network simultaneously while ensuring a certain system performance. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed theoretical results.

Pioneers have proposed many node deployment based lifetime optimization methods for WSNs, however, the retransmission mechanism and the discrete power control strategy, which are widely used in practice and have large effect on the network energy consumption, are often neglected and assumed as a continuous one, respectively, in the previous studies. In this paper, both retransmission and discrete power control are considered together, and a more realistic energy-consumption-based network lifetime model for linear WSNs is provided. Using this model, we then propose a generic deployment-based optimization model that maximizes network lifetime under coverage, connectivity and transmission rate success constraints. The more accurate lifetime evaluation conduces to a longer optimal network lifetime in the realistic situation. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method, both one-tiered and two-tiered uniformly and non-uniformly distributed linear WSNs are optimized in our case studies, and the comparisons between our optimal results and those based on relatively inaccurate lifetime evaluation show the advantage of our method when investigating WSN lifetime optimization problems.					fan, jing/KHX-6210-2024	Li, Ruiying/0000-0001-8044-4813													1932-6203					NOV 29	2017	12	11							e0188519	10.1371/journal.pone.0188519	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188519								29186167					WOS:000416484900042

MRRP allows for multichannel-enabled signal transmission between sensors and remote estimators, thereby significantly mitigating network congestion. Different types of attacks are supposed to be encountered during the sensor data transmission via network. Both the impacts of the MRRP and the attacks are reflected in modeling the addressed system. The purpose of this article is to design an estimator capable of constraining the estimation error within an ellipsoidal region in the presence of noise interference, mixed delays, MRRP, and MIAs. Using recursive matrix inequality (RMI) techniques, sufficient conditions are derived for achieving the desired performance and the expected state estimator gains are derived by minimizing the constrained ellipsoid region. Ultimately, the efficacy of the developed estimate strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulation.

Existence, Uniqueness, and Exponential Stability of Uncertain Delayed Neural Networks with Inertial Term: Nonreduced Order Case	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												In this work, we mainly focus on uncertain delayed neural network system with inertial term. Here, the existence, uniqueness, and exponential stability of inertial neural networks are derived without shifting the second order differential system into first order through substituting variables. Initially, we construct a proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional to investigate the stability of novel uncertain delayed inertial neural networks, which is different from the classical Lyapunov functional approach. By utilizing the ICirchhoff's matrix tree theorem, Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, homeomorphism theorem, and some inequality techniques, the necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the designed framework Subsequently, to exhibit the strength of this outcome, we framed a quantitative example.

Asymptotic and Finite-Time Semistability for Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems With Application to Network Consensus	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												This article focuses on semistability and finite-time semistability analysis and synthesis of discrete-time dynamical systems having a continuum of equilibria. Semistability is the property whereby the solutions of a dynamical system converge to Lyapunov stable equilibrium points determined by the system initial conditions. In this article, we build on the theories of semistability and finite-time semistability for continuous-time dynamical systems to develop a rigorous framework for discrete semistability and discrete finite-time semistability. Specifically, Lyapunov and converse Lyapunov theorems for semistability and finite-time semistability are developed, and the regularity properties of the Lyapunov function establishing finite-time semistability are shown to be related to the settling time function capturing the finite settling time behavior of the dynamical system. These results are then used to develop a general framework for designing semistable and finite-time semistable consensus protocols for discrete dynamical networks for achieving multiagent coordination tasks asymptotically and in finite time. The proposed controller architectures involve the exchange of generalized energy state information between agents guaranteeing that the closed-loop dynamical network is semistable to an equipartitioned equilibrium representing a state of consensus consistent with basic thermodynamic principles.

Robust Synchronization of Two Linear Systems over Intermittent Communication Networks	2015 54TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control				54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 15-18, 2015	Osaka, JAPAN	Kozo Keikaku Engn, MathWorks, Springer, CYBERNET Syst, Mitsubishi Elect, Soc Ind & Appl Math, Altair, Int Journal Automat & Comp, IEEE CAA Journal Automatica Sinica, Cogent Engn, Now, IHI, IEEE				The property of synchronization between two identical linear time-invariant (LTI) systems connected through a network with stochastically-driven isolated communication events is studied. More precisely, the goal is to design feedback controllers that, using information obtained over such networks, asymptotically drive the values of their state to synchronization and render the synchronization condition Lyapunov stable. To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic controller with hybrid dynamics, namely, the controller exhibits continuous dynamics between communication events while it has variables that jump at such events. Due to the additional continuous and discrete dynamics inherent in the networked systems and communication structure, we utilize a hybrid systems framework to model the closed-loop system. The problem of synchronization is then recast as a set stabilization problem and, by utilizing recent Lyapunov stability tools for hybrid systems, sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of the synchronization set are provided for two network topologies: a cascade (unidirectional) network and a feedback (bidirectional) communication network with independent transmission instances. Furthermore, we study the robustness of synchronization by considering a class of perturbations on the transmitted data. Numerical examples are provided.

The design has significance in networks such as multi-protocol-label-switching (MPLS)-based networks where such conditions can be applicable. For large networks, we present the solution approach using Lagrangean decomposition algorithm by considering the dual problem and using sub-gradient optimization. The dual subproblems are shown to have integral solutions for continuous relaxed versions. Such a construction gives us the benefit of solving the MIP problem with a series of continuous problems. We present numerical results for fairly large networks generated randomly using a topology and traffic generator.

Distributed event-triggered algorithms for the management of networked battery systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												Distributed algorithms have recently been developed for a networked battery system composed of multiple battery units, each of which serves as an energy storage unit. These emerging distributed algorithms rely on continuous communication among battery units and/or continuous update of power allocation for each battery unit. To reduce the communication and computational burden, we propose distributed event-triggered algorithms for the management of networked battery systems with unknown battery unit parameters. In particular, two event-triggered distributed estimators are designed for each battery unit to respectively estimate the average battery unit state and the average desired power with any specified level of accuracy. Two dynamic event-triggering mechanisms are proposed for the distributed estimators that determine when each battery unit communicates with its neighbors. Based on these two event-triggered distributed estimators, an event-triggered distributed adaptive power allocating law along with a static event-triggering mechanism is designed for each battery unit to update the power allocation in a discrete-time manner. It is shown that the proposed power allocating laws achieve state-of-charge balancing among all battery units while delivering the desired total power in either the charging or discharging mode without requiring either continuous communication or continuous update of power allocation. It is also shown that the Zeno behavior is excluded for all the three event-triggering mechanisms. A simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed design.

Discrete Time Formulation for the Integration of Scheduling and Dynamic Optimization	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												We propose a model-based optimization approach for the integration of production scheduling and dynamic process operation for general continuous/batch processes. The method introduces a discrete time formulation for simultaneous optimization of scheduling arid operating decisions. The process is described by the resource task network (RTN) representation coupled with detailed first-principles process dynamic models. General cbmplications in Scheduling and control can be fully represented in this modeling framework, such as customer orders, transfer policies, and requirements on product quality and process safety. The scheduling and operation layers are linked with the task history state variables in the state space RTN model: A tailored generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) algorithm is applied to efficiently solve the resulting large nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program by exploring the particular model structure. We apply the integrated optimization approach to a polymerization process with two parallel semibatch reactors and continuous storage and purification units. The two polymerization reactors share cooling utility from the same source, and the utility price is dependent on the consumption rate. The optimization objective is to design the process schedule and reactor control policies simultaneously to maximize the overall process profit. The case study results suggest improvements in plant profitability for the integrated approach, in contrast to the typical sequential approach, where recipes of the polymerization tasks are individually optimized but the interactions among process units are overlooked.

However, it cannot be directly applied to solve discrete problems such as clustering of sensor nodes in the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). For this purpose, in this paper, we present a chaotic discrete version of the ABC algorithm, denoted as chaotic discrete ABC (CDABC). By using the CDABC algorithm, we propose a novel clustering protocol that can be used to organize WSNs into multiple levels of clusters to reduce their energy consumption. The main objective of this protocol is to improve WSN's lifetime by selecting appropriate nodes as cluster heads in each clustering level and reducing the energy costs of the inter-cluster and intra-cluster communications. Extensive simulations results validate the effectiveness of the proposed CDABC-based multi-level clustering protocol in improving the network lifetime.

The communication subgraph among followers is undirected and connected. It is assumed that only partial relative state information of the leader can be obtained by each follower. The networked detectability condition only requires that the leader is jointly detectable to all followers, without any detectability requirement on an individual follower. Under the assumption that the system is neurally stable, distributed observer-type consensus protocols are constructed for both continuous- and discrete-time linear multi-agent systems. By using tools from matrix theory and linear system analysis, some sufficient conditions are derived to reach consensus tracking. One favourable feature of this study is that the traditional detectability condition for an individual system is extended to the networked case and in contrast to the relevant available results, reduced-order observers are presented to reduce information redundancy. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

This paper considers the Optimal Blockchain Sharding (OBCS) problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the decision variables are the number of shards, block size and block interval. Previous works solved the OBCS problem via Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based methods, where the action space must be discretized to increase processability. However, the discretization degrades the quality of the solution since the optimal solution usually lies between discrete values. In this paper, we treat the block size and block interval as continuous decision variables and provide dynamic sharding strategies based on them. The Branching Dueling Q-Network Blockchain Sharding (BDQBS) algorithm is designed for discrete action spaces. Compared with traditional DRL algorithms, the BDQBS overcomes the drawbacks of high action space dimensions and difficulty in training neural networks. And it improves the performance of the blockchain system by 1.25 times. We also propose a sharding control algorithm based on the Parameterized Deep Q-Networks (P-DQN) algorithm, i.e., the Parameterized Deep Q-Networks Blockchain Sharding (P-DQNBS) algorithm, to efficiently handle the discrete-continuous hybrid action space without the scalability issues.

For this purpose, the expert network handles two different identification methods to derive parametric discrete models techniques of reduced mathematical complexity from measured input-output data series. One of the methods is based on a typically used least-squares minimization, while the other one is based on the Leverrier's algorithm; that is, using a data series of the impulse response of the system to identify a parametric discrete model. These techniques are of particular practical interest when the continuous-time system is unknown or when dealing with discrete-time systems whose analytical expression become very complex due, for instance, to the use of finite duration real sampling. The expert network improves the discretization process implementing a biestiestimation mechanism that switches to the model that provides a better performance at each considered estimation instant for different values of the hold order.

The main contribution of the paper is that a new form of the augmented closed-loop system is proposed, which can improve control performance. Based on a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and a LMI (linear matrix inequality)-based procedure, a state feedback controller which contains network-induced delays and data packet dropouts is designed for a class of linear systems. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to some existing schemes in the literature.

The problem is nonlinear and, in the version addressed here, the bars must take certain discrete sizes. It is shown that a logic-based method that dispenses with integer variables and branches directly on logical disjunctions can solve substantially larger problems than mixed integer programming, even though the nonlinearities disappear in the mixed integer model. A primary purpose of the paper is to investigate whether advantages of logic-based branching that have been demonstrated elsewhere for linear problems extend to nonlinear programming.

Design of Discrete Time Notch Filter for Biomedical Applications	PROCEEDINGS OF 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON 2017 DEVICES FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (DEVIC)					2nd International Conference on Devices for Integrated Circuit (DevIC)	MAR 23-24, 2017	Kalyani, INDIA	IEEE Kalyani Govt Engn Coll Student Branch Chapter, Kalyani Govt Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, IEEE EDS Kolkata Chapter				The challenge in obtaining accurate recordings of biomedical signals such as EEG and ECG is to deal with the interference that is caused due to power line, which is a low frequency signal at 50Hz/60Hz. In order to yield accurate readings from ECG/EEG there is a need to eliminate this interfering signal. This paper presents the design of discrete-time notch filter to eliminate 60Hz. The filter is implemented in CMOS 180nm technology. The Tow-Thomas topology is used for the implementation of the filter which includes fully differential operational amplifier and switched capacitor based resistors. The conventional approach of filter design i.e continuous time approach using resistors consumed large silicon area, hence a discrete time approach is presented in this paper which replaces the resistors by switched-capacitor network. The results of discrete time filter show a notch depth of 62.3dB consuming power of 9.936 mu W. The design is simulated using Cadence Virtuoso and the post layout simulations are presented.

Generally, they are resolved separately in present deep-learning-based methods, with one network orientated for one individual task, bringing low training efficiency and waste of computing resources. Although the output labels for these two tasks are entirely different, one is discrete and the other is continuous, they both reflect the equipment's health status and, thus, are related. To address these two tasks altogether in one deep network, this article proposes a new framework for task transfer learning. Long short-term memory plus two dense layers is built as the source model, and fuzzy membership is first adopted to construct new labels for source model training, with the target to bridge the gap between classical discrete and continuous output labels. Furthermore, three kinds of fuzzy membership functions (triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian) are designed for labeling and comparison. To verify the proposed framework, experimental validation is conducted on the C-MAPSS turbo-engine dataset. The degradation phase classification and RUL prediction are designed as discrete classification and continuous regression tasks, respectively. Results confirm that the fuzzy-membership-based labeling can effectively improve the source model performance in task transfer learning. In addition, the trapezoidal performs better than the triangular and Gaussian among the three membership functions.

Different from the traditional continuous neural network model, the differential inclusion theory is utilized to deal with discontinuous systems. Then, based on Lyapunov stability theory, two operational and efficient pure power-law control schemes are designed to ensure FXTAS and PATS. PATS is more flexible than fixed-time synchronization because its settling-time can be set in advance according to the actual situation. Finally, two numerical simulations are given to confirm the consistency with the theoretical results obtained in this paper.

Robust reliable <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> control for stochastic neural networks with randomly occurring delays	NEUROCOMPUTING												This paper investigates the problem of robust stabilization for a class of discrete-time stochastic neural networks with randomly occurring discrete and distributed time-varying delays. More precisely, the neuron activation functions are assumed to be more general and satisfy sector-like nonlinearities. Moreover, the effects of both variation range and probability distribution of mixed time-delays are taken into consideration in the proposed problem. The main objective of this paper is to design a state feedback reliable Ho, controller such that for all admissible uncertainties as well as actuator failure cases, the resulting closed-loop form of considered neural network is robustly asymptotically stable while satisfying a prescribed H-infinity performance constraint. Linear matrix inequality approach together with proper construction of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is employed for obtaining delay dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of robust reliable H-infinity controller. The obtained results are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved by using the MATLAB LMI toolbox. Finally, a numerical example with simulation results is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained control law and less conservativeness of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Delay-Dependent Guaranteed Cost Controller Design for Uncertain Neural Networks with Interval Time-Varying Delay	ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS												This paper studies the problem of guaranteed cost control for a class of uncertain delayed neural networks. The time delay is a continuous function belonging to a given interval but not necessary to be differentiable. A cost function is considered as a nonlinear performance measure for the closed-loop system. The stabilizing controllers to be designed must satisfy some exponential stability constraints on the closed-loop poles. By constructing a set of augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals combined with Newton-Leibniz formula, a guaranteed cost controller is designed via memoryless state feedback control, and new sufficient conditions for the existence of the guaranteed cost state feedback for the system are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

J	Gan, QT				Gan, Qintao			Adaptive synchronization of stochastic neural networks with mixed time delays and reaction-diffusion terms	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS												In this paper, the problem of exponential synchronization is investigated for a class of stochastic perturbed chaotic neural networks with both mixed time delays and reaction-diffusion terms. By employing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and stochastic analysis approaches, an adaptive controller is designed to guarantee the exponential synchronization of proposed neural networks in the mean square. In particular, the mixed time delays in this paper synchronously consist of constant delay in the leakage term (i.e., "leakage delay"), discrete time-varying delay and distributed time-varying delay which are more general than those discussed in the previous literature. Furthermore, our synchronization criteria are easily verified and do not need to solve any linear matrix inequality. Therefore, the results obtained in this paper generalize and improve those given in the previous literature. Finally, the extensive simulations are performed to show the effectiveness and feasibility of the obtained method.																			0924-090X					SEP	2012	69	4					2207	2219		10.1007/s11071-012-0420-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-012-0420-4													WOS:000305401000055

From the test problem, it is shown that the bilevel formulation is more desirable than the two known single-level models based respectively on system-optimal and UO DTA. For the multiorigin, multidestination, larger-size problem, three metaheuristics that can produce solutions beyond local optimality are employed: simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), and random search (RS). These metaheuristics share the same functional evaluation: a simulation-based UO DTA that propagates traffic according to Daganzo's cell transmission model. From computational results, GA outperforms the others for all three test problems in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and processor time, whereas SA and RS appear nondominated. It is also shown that the appropriate set of algorithm parameters is network-specific and should be recalibrated for each network to achieve the best results.

J	Luo, SD; Nie, Y				Luo, Sida; Nie, Yu (Marco)			Impact of ride-pooling on the nature of transit network design	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												This paper examines the basic design trade-off in six distinctive transit systems, including two state-of-the-art fixed-route systems and four hybrid systems that use ride-pooling as an integrated feeder service. The systems are analyzed using a continuous approximation approach, and the resulting optimal design problem is formulated and solved as a mixed integer program. We find that ride-pooling changes little the fundamental laws inherent in transit design. Specifically, all six systems, despite their seemingly vastly different design features, display the following laws: (1) that the per capita agency cost correlates linearly with the per capita user cost, (2) that both costs are power functions of the demand density with an exponent close to -1/3 and -0.4 for agency and user costs, respectively, and (3) that the per capita agency cost is not significantly affected by city size but the user cost is. This finding suggests that ride-pooling may have a rather limited impact on the economy of scale in mass transit systems. However, mixing ride-pooling with fixed-route services does promise modest improvements to the overall system efficiency. It also tilts the balance of trade-off considerably in the user's favor, at the operator's expense. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our investigations show that almost 85% of the ANN connections are removed compared to the fully connected ANN (FC-ANN) with 50% decrease in the number of inputs of the ANN.

Optimization procedures must be robust and efficient if they are to be incorporated in automated design systems. For heat integrated separation process design, a natural hybrid evolutionary/local search method with these properties is possible. The method is based on the use of local search methods for the continuous design parameters for the units in the process and the use of an evolutionary optimization procedure for the design of the heat exchanger network. The use of a stochastic method for the heat exchanger network aspect introduces noise in the evaluation of the objective function used by the local search methods. A smoothing procedure has been designed and implemented to improve the efficacy of the hybrid approach. This paper presents the evaluation of a variety of local search methods. It is shown that the Hooke and Jeeves algorithm, combined with a simple genetic algorithm, provides a robust, efficient and effective solution procedure for optimizing heat integrated distillation sequences.

Our approach employs a relatively simple and accurate model that pays some attention to the requirements of the solvers that we employ. Our view is that in doing so, with the goal of calculating only good feasible solutions, complicated algorithmics can be confined to the MINLP solver. We report successful computational experience using available open-source MINLP software on problems from the literature and on difficult real-world instances. An important contribution of this paper is that the solutions obtained, besides being low cost, are immediately usable in practice because they are characterized by an allocation of diameters to pipes that leads to a correct hydraulic operation of the network.

H.; Bagajewicz, Miguel J.			<i>110th Anniversary</i>: On the Departure from Heuristics and Simplified Models toward Globally Optimal Design of Process Equipment	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												Despite the large advances in computational tools attained by the Process Systems Engineering community, industry for the most part still performs basic design of process equipment using trial-and-verification procedures guided by heuristic rules. In this opinion article, we present a discussion on how to depart from the use of these heuristics-based procedures, most step-by-step, sometimes computer-aided. We believe that there are direction changes, some incipient and some in full development already, toward the use of optimization tools for the task. The academic literature is dominated by mixed-integer nonlinear models, solved using different techniques (mostly stochastic or mathematical programming-based). These procedures have practical limitations that have hindered the migration of practitioners away from current heuristics and simplified model-based tools. We discuss these drawbacks and propose solutions. We first show how the use of commercially available discrete values of the design geometrical variables followed by reformulation can render linear models, solved using mixed-integer linear programming, sometimes integer linear programming. We also show how reformulation or judicious discretization of continuous variables can lead to a large reduction in the number of nonlinearities, such that they can be solved using commercial and noncommercial global solvers with larger efficiency and robustness. Next, we present the use of set trimming to aid global optimization of equipment designs, as means of reducing the search space. Then, we present the technique of smart enumeration, which can be used instead of MINLP models and eventually after set-trimming. We also discuss changes in modeling and propose to move away from simple models, where we argue for abandoning physical properties as well as transport-like coefficients that are based on averages, to use properties and transport coefficients calculated locally inside and along the equipment. Then, we discuss the impact of the above proposals on flow sheet synthesis and retrofit problems. As these advances show higher memory and speed needs, we discuss how parallel computing (using the cloud, small computer clusters, or supercomputers) can address the aforementioned challenges.

J	Weber, JB; Hartisch, M; Herbst, AD; Lorenz, U				Weber, Jonas B.; Hartisch, Michael; Herbst, Alexander D.; Lorenz, Ulf			Towards an algorithmic synthesis of thermofluid systems	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING												Individual technical components are usually well optimized. However, the design process of entire technical systems, especially in its early stages, is still dominated by human intuition and the practical experience of engineers. In this context, our vision is the widespread availability of software tools to support the human-driven design process with the help of modern mathematical methods. As a contribution to this, we consider a selected class of technical systems, so-called thermofluid systems. From a technical point of view, these systems comprise fluid distribution as well as superimposed heat transfer. Based on models for simple fluid systems as extensively studied in literature, we develop model extensions and algorithmic methods directed towards the optimized synthesis of thermofluid systems to a practical extent. Concerning fluid systems, we propose a Branch-and-Bound framework, exploiting problem-specific characteristics. This framework is then further analyzed using the application example of booster stations for high-rise buildings. In addition, we demonstrate the application of Quantified Programs to meet possible resilience requirements with respect to the systems generated. In order to model basic thermofluid systems, we extend the existing formulation for fluid systems by including heat transfer. Since this consideration alone is not able to deal with dynamic system behavior, we face this challenge separately by providing a more sophisticated representation dealing with the temporal couplings that result from storage components. For the considered case, we further show the advantages of this special continuous-time representation compared to the more common representation using discrete time intervals.

J	Al-Areqi, S; Görges, D; Liu, S				Al-Areqi, Sanad; Goerges, Daniel; Liu, Steven			Event-based networked control and scheduling codesign with guaranteed performance	AUTOMATICA												Besides a fair distribution of limited resources among competing plants in a networked embedded control system (NECS) an efficient utilization of such scarce resources is crucial. Therefore, a novel event-based codesign concept for NECSs with limited communication bandwidth and computation capacity is presented in this paper. The codesign concept involves a joint design of an event-based controller and scheduler (EBCS) for improving the control performance provided that the limited resources are used efficiently. The NECS with a set of interacting continuous-time LTI plants is modeled as a discrete-time switched linear system. The EBCS codesign problem is then formulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem minimizing an associated quadratic cost function. The EBCS strategy is then evaluated and compared with existing codesign strategies in literature for a simulation study involving a simultaneous stabilization of two mechanically coupled inverted pendulums. It should be remarked finally that the proposed EBCS strategy is generally applicable to discrete-time switched linear systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, DNNs need a huge dataset to train if we need to select materials from the material library for the inverse design. This puts the DNN method into a dilemma of poor performance with a small training dataset or loss of the advantage of short design time, for collecting a large amount of data is time consuming. In this work, we propose a multi-scenario training method for the DNN model using imbalanced datasets. The imbalanced datasets used by our method is nearly four times smaller compared with other training methods. We believe that as the material library increases, the advantages of the imbalanced datasets will become more obvious. Using the high-precision predictive DNN model obtained by this new method, different multilayer nanoparticles and multilayer nanofilms have been designed with a hybrid optimization algorithm combining genetic algorithm and gradient descent optimization algorithm. The advantage of our method is that it can freely select discrete materials from the material library and simultaneously find the inverse design of discrete material type and continuous structural parameters of the nanophotonic devices.

J	Gao, H; Wang, YQ				Gao, Huan; Wang, Yongqiang			A Pulse-Based Integrated Communication and Control Design for Decentralized Collective Motion Coordination	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												Decentralized collective motion coordination is fundamental in systems as diverse as mobile sensor networks, swarm robotics, autonomous vehicles, and animal groups. In motion coordination, to conform to the discontinuous message exchange that can only be conducted at discrete-time instants, existing approaches addressing motion coordination usually perform continuous control design followed by discretization-based implementation. This two-stage strategy, however, can be problematic since discretization can harm or even destabilize the controller designed in the continuous-time domain. Inspired by pulse-based interaction in flashing fireflies and firing neurons, we propose an integrated communication and control approach for the motion coordination. The approach circumvents discretization and can guarantee the original control design performance in final implementation. Its communication only employs simple and identical pulses, which significantly reduces processing latency and communication delay compared with conventional packet-based communications. Not only can heading control be achieved in the proposed approach to coordinate the headings (orientations) of motions in a network, but also spacing control for circular motion is achievable to design the spacing between neighboring nodes (e.g., vehicles or robots).																			0018-9286	1558-2523				JUN	2018	63	6					1858	1864		10.1109/TAC.2017.2765279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2017.2765279													WOS:000433367600030

Energy Efficient Collaborative Beamforming for Reducing Sidelobe in Wireless Sensor Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING												Collaborative beamforming (CB) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based on a virtual node antenna array (VNAA) can increase the transmission distance and enhance the energy efficiency of sensor nodes. However, a VNAA cannot be pre-designed like the conventional antenna arrays due to the randomly deployed sensor nodes, thereby causing a high sidelobe level (SLL) which increases the interferences. In this article, we formulate a hybrid discrete and continuous optimization problem (HDCOP) for reducing the maximum SLL. HDCOP requires to solve both the discrete and the continuous problems simultaneously, and we propose both centralized and consensus-based distributed CB strategies for solving HDCOP. For the centralized strategy, we convert HDCOP into two sub-optimization problems, and propose a discrete cuckoo search (CS) algorithm for the node location selection optimization and a continuous CS algorithm to optimize the excitation current weights of the selected nodes. For the distributed strategy, we propose a parallel distributed CS algorithm to solve the discrete and continuous parts of HDCOP simultaneously. Moreover, we propose two operating mechanisms based on these two algorithms. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies for reducing the maximum SLL of CB in WSNs. Moreover, the proposed CB strategies have better performance in terms of the energy efficiency compared with other approaches such as the cross-entropy optimization-based method.					Leung, Victor C.

While digital circuits use discrete voltage levels, analog circuits use a continuous range of voltage. The synthesis of analog circuits is known to be a complex optimization task, due to the continuous behaviour of the output and the lack of automatic design tools, actually, the design process is almost entirely demanded to the engineers. In this research work, we introduce a new clonal selection algorithm, the elitist Immune Programming, (EIP) which uses a new class of hypermutation operators and a network-based coding. The EIP algorithm is designed for the synthesis of topology and sizing of analog electrical circuits; in particular, it has been used for the design of passive filters. To assess the effectiveness of the designed algorithm, the obtained results have been compared with the passive filter discovered by Koza and co-authors using the Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm. The circuits obtained by EIP algorithm are better than the one found by GP in terms of frequency response and number of components required to build it.

The switched complex dynamical networks are composed ofmmodes that are switched from one to another based on time, state, etc. Although, the active subsystem is known in any instance, but the switching law such as transition probabilities are not known. The model for each mode is considered affine with matched and unmatched perturbations. The main purpose of the addressed problem is to design a filter error for the switched complex dynamical networks such that the dynamics of the error converges to the asymptotically irrespective of the admissible parameter variations with the gains. Then, by utilizing the Lyapunov functional method, the stochastic analysis combined with the matrix inequality techniques, a sufficient condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities is presented to ensure the H8 performance of the complex dynamical system models. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

The digraph is assumed to have fixed topology and contain a spanning tree. Cooperative observer design guaranteeing convergence of the estimates of all agents to their actual states is proposed. The notion of convergence region for distributed observers on graphs is introduced. It is shown that the proposed cooperative observer design has a robustness property. Application of cooperative observers is made to the synchronization problem. A command trajectory generator and pinning control are employed for synchronizing all the agents to a desired trajectory. Complete knowledge about the agent's state is not assumed. A duality principle is shown for observers and state feedback for distributed discrete-time systems on graph topologies. Three different observer/controller architectures are proposed for dynamic output feedback regulator design, and they are shown to guarantee convergence of the estimate to the true state and synchronization of all the agents' states to the command state trajectory. This provides design methods for cooperative regulators based on a separation principle. It is shown that the observer convergence region and feedback control synchronizing region for discrete-time systems are inherently bounded, so that the conditions for observer convergence and state synchronization are stricter than the results for the continuous-time counterparts. This is in part remedied by using weighting of different feedback coupling gains for every agent. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Resistor networks simulation for electrodes with mixed ionic and electronic conductivity oxides (MIEC) is not typically used due to the presence of oxygen ions and electrons as charge carriers. To address this complexity within the model, two resistor networks are employed. These networks conduct the different electrical species, and are linked through a resistor representing the charge transfer (CT) process. In the case of mixed -conducting electrodes, this CT occurs at the surface exposed to the gas phase. The electrode simulated in this study is generated using the discrete element method of random sphere insertion, and subsequently voxelized to create the resistor network. This method considers the geometric and microstructural parameters of the electrode, such as porosity, particle size, and electrode thickness. Electrical parameters are incorporated into the network through the values of the various conductivities characterizing MIEC oxides and including CT interface conductivities. By integrating geometric, microstructural, and electrical parameters, the model accurately captures the behavior of the electrodes. The close agreement between simulation and experimental/theoretical results highlights the efficacy of the approach in elucidating the electrochemical processes occurring at the MIEC electrode.																				2352-4928				JUN	2024	39								109259	10.1016/j.mtcomm.2024.109259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mtcomm.2024.109259													WOS:001245032100001

The SBSs work in full-duplex (FD) mode and the DL/UL users are half-duplex (HD). Due to co-channel transmissions, the DL and the UL are mutually interfered. This motivates us to consider a joint DL/UL beamformer design for maximizing the system sum rate. Different from the conventional sum rate maximization (SRM), where the user's rate is allowed to be any nonnegative real number, herein we focus on the discrete-rate case - each user's rate is constrained to a prescribed discrete-rate set. This discrete-rate constraint is motivated by the fact that practical communication systems are designed for a finite number of transmission rates, owing to the finite number of modulation and coding schemes (MCS). In view of this, our SRM problem is coined as discrete SRM (DSRM). The DSRM problem is essentially a mixed-integer nonlinear program, and NP-hard. To tackle it, two different approaches are proposed. The first approach is built upon the simplex reformulation of the discrete rate and the mirror descent (MD) algorithm. The second approach exploits the correspondence between the rate and minimum mean-square error (MMSE), and employs the block-coordinate descent (BCD) method to find an approximate solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior rate performance of the proposed designs as compared with the weighted MMSE (WMMSE) design with naive rate quantization.

In this paper, we propose a novel memristive multidirectional associative memory neural networks (MAMNNs) model with mixed time-varying delays. More precisely, the proposed model is investigated with time-varying delays and distributed delays. Then, we design two kinds of delay-independent and delay-dependent controllers to analyze the problem of finite-time synchronization. Based on the drive-response concept and Lyapunov function, some sufficient criteria guaranteeing the finite-time synchronization of the drive-response system are derived. With the removal of certain constraints on the weight parameters, the results we obtained for synchronization are less conservative. To illustrate the chaotic characteristics of the memristive MAMNNs, an image encryption scheme is designed. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the proposed theories is validated with numerical experiments.

The neural network identification scheme is combined with the traditional adaptive critic technique, in order to design the nonlinear robust optimal control under uncertain environment. First, the robust optimal controller of the original uncertain system with a specified cost function is established by adding a feedback gain to the optimal controller of the nominal system. Then, a neural network identifier is employed to reconstruct the unknown dynamics of the nominal system with stability analysis. Hence, the data-based adaptive critic designs can be developed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the transformed optimal control problem.

The DNDP is often cast in a bilevel programming problem which is known to be NP-hard. Despite a plethora of research, due to the combinatorial complexity, efforts to address the problem for large-sized networks while considering public transport as well as other modes (multimodal/multiclass traffic flow) are scarce. To this end, we first turn the bilevel problem to a single-level problem based on System-Optimal traffic flow which results in a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Second, we develop an efficient Benders decomposition algorithm to solve the ensuing MINLP problem. The multiclass/multimodal features of the traffic flow are ensured by employing the Spiess' bias term and optimal strategy methods. The proposed methodology is applied to Sioux Falls and a real sized network of the city of Winnipeg, Canada.					sarvi, majid/A-2397-2009; Thompson, Russell G/D-6451-2012; Rajabifard, Abbas/D-1818-2015	Saberi, Meead/0000-0002-6526-239X; Rajabifard, Abbas/0000-0002-4256-3173; Thompson, Russell/0000-0002-8128-6586; Asadi Bagloee, Saeed/0000-0001-6078-6314															978-1-5090-1889-5				2016							235	240																WOS:000392215500039
J	Huang, H; Huang, TW; Chen, XP				Huang, He; Huang, Tingwen; Chen, Xiaoping			A mode-dependent approach to state estimation of recurrent neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters and mixed delays	NEURAL NETWORKS												This paper is concerned with the problem of state estimation of recurrent neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters and mixed delays. A mode-dependent approach is proposed by constructing a novel Lyapunov functional, where some terms involving triple or quadruple integrals are taken into account. The advantage is that as many as possible of the Lyapunov matrices are chosen to be mode-dependent. Several design criteria are established under which the estimation error system is globally exponentially stable in the mean square sense. The gain matrices of the state estimator can be then found by solving a set of coupled linear matrix inequalities. It is shown in theory that better performance can be achieved by this approach. Furthermore, by introducing some scaling parameters, this approach is effectively employed to deal with the state estimation problem of the neural networks with complex dynamic behaviors, to which some existing results are not applicable.

J	Peng, C; Han, QL; Yue, D				Peng, Chen; Han, Qing-Long; Yue, Dong			To Transmit or Not to Transmit: A Discrete Event-Triggered Communication Scheme for Networked Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS												This paper first proposes a discrete event-triggered communication scheme for a class of networked Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems. This scheme has two main features: 1) Whether or not the sampled state should be transmitted is determined by the current-sampled state and the error between the current-sampled state and the latest transmitted state. Compared with those in a periodic time-triggered communication scheme, the communication bandwidth utilization is considerably reduced while preserving the desired control performance; and 2) it is a discrete event-triggered communication scheme due to the fact that the triggered conditions are only measured and checked at a constant sampling period. Compared with a continuous event-triggered communication scheme, the special hardware for continuous measurement and computation is no longer needed. Second, a networked T-S fuzzy model is delicately constructed, which not only considers nonuniform time scales in the networked T-S fuzzy model and the parallel distributed compensation fuzzy control rules but includes the aforementioned state error as well. Third, a stability criterion and a stabilization criterion about the networked T-S fuzzy system are derived, respectively. The stability criterion and stabilization criterion can provide a tradeoff to balance the required communication resource and the desired performance: Lowering the desired performance allows the network to allocate more limited bandwidth to other nodes in need. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.					peng, chen/HHS-8720-2022; Han, Qing-Long/B-6635-2013; 刘, 钊/H-1520-2015; han, qing/KCZ-0174-2024; Yue, Dong/ITW-1999-2023; Yue, Dong/ITW-1908-2023	peng, chen/0000-0003-3652-2233; Han, Qing-Long/0000-0002-7207-0716; Yue, Dong/0000-0001-7810-9338													1063-6706	1941-0034				FEB	2013	21	1					164	170		10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2199994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2199994													WOS:000314724900012

Vincent			User Preference Aware Lossless Data Compression at the Edge	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS												Data compression is an efficient technique for saving data storage and transmission costs in networks. Traditional data compression methods usually compress each content item according to its own statistical distribution of symbols and do not take into account user preferences on various content items. However, user preferences significantly impact the statistical distributions of symbols transmitted over communication links. This paper presents an edge source coding method to compress data at the network edge, in which codebooks are designed based on not only the statistical distributions of symbols in the content items but also the user preferences. In edge source coding, multiple content items might be compressed via the same codebook. For discrete user preferences, DCA (difference of convex functions programming algorithm) based and k-means++ based algorithms are proposed to derive codebook designs. For continuous user preferences, a sampling method is applied to yield codebook designs. In addition, edge source coding is extended to the two-user case and codebooks are designed to utilize multicasting opportunities. Simulation results demonstrate that edge source coding significantly reduces transmission costs for short content items.					Poor, H. Vincent/S-5027-2016; Chen, Wei/E-6592-2015	Poor, H.

Model-based robust design is difficult because of the complexity of the hybrid dynamic models including continuous vehicle dynamics, the discrete models of computations and communications, and the size of the problem. We will overview recent advances in methodology and tools to model, analyze, and design robust autonomous aerospace systems operating in uncertain environment, with stress on efficient uncertainty quantification and robust design using the case studies of the mission including model-based target tracking and search, and trajectory planning in uncertain urban environment. To show that the methodology is generally applicable to uncertain dynamical systems, we will also show examples of application of the new methods to efficient uncertainty quantification of energy usage in buildings, and stability assessment of interconnected power networks.

To solve FDLSNILE, the corresponding continuous different-level system of nonlinear inequality and linear equation (CDLSNILE) is first analyzed, and then, a continuous combined zeroing neural network (CCZNN) model for solving CDLSNILE is proposed. To obtain a discrete combined zeroing neural network (DCZNN) model for solving FDLSNILE, a high-precision general 7-instant Zhang et al. discretization (ZeaD) formula for the first-order time derivative approximation is proposed. Furthermore, by applying the general 7-instant ZeaD formula to discretize the CCZNN model, a general 7-instant DCZNN (7IDCZNN) model is thus proposed for solving FDLSNILE. For comparison, by using three conventional ZeaD formulas, three conventional DCZNN models are also developed. Meanwhile, theoretical analyses and results guarantee the efficacy and superiority of the general 7IDCZNN model compared with the other three conventional DCZNN models for solving FDLSNILE. Finally, several comparative numerical experiments, including the motion control of a 5-link redundant manipulator, are provided to substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the general 7-instant ZeaD formula and the corresponding 7IDCZNN model.

The randomly varying coupling is governed by a Markov chain, and the capacity constraint is handled by introducing a logarithmic quantizer. The uncertainty of measurements is modeled by a multiplicative noise. An asynchronous estimator is designed to overcome the difficulty that each node cannot access to the coupling information, and an augmented estimation error system is obtained using the Kronecker product. Sufficient conditions are established, which guarantee that the estimation error system is stochastically stable and achieves the strict (Q, S, R)-gamma-dissipativity. Then, the estimator gains are derived using the linear matrix inequality method. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed new design techniques.																			2162-237X	2162-2388				FEB	2017	28	2					268	277		10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2503772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2503772								28055910					WOS:000394522900003

The strategic level of supply chain planning and tactical level planning of supply chain are aggregated to propose an integrated model. The model integrates location and capacity choices for suppliers, plants and warehouses selection, product range assignment and production flows. The open-or-close decisions for the facilities are binary decision variables and the production and transportation flow decisions are continuous decision variables. Consequently, this problem is a binary mixed integer linear programming problem. In this paper, a modified version of Benders' decomposition is proposed to solve the model. The most difficulty associated with the Benders' decomposition is the solution of master problem, as in many real-life problems the model will be NP-hard and very time consuming. In the proposed procedure, the master problem will be developed using the surrogate constraints. We show that the main constraints of the master problem can be replaced by the strongest surrogate constraint. The generated problem with the strongest surrogate constraint is a valid relaxation of the main problem. Furthermore, a near-optimal initial solution is generated for a reduction in the number of iterations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the considered system, a discrete-time interconnected process is controlled by a network of sensors, controllers, and actuators that collect information about the plant, and apply control actions to manage the plant dynamics. The motivation for this paper is that the communication between the plant network and the controller network can be exploited for the system-wide purpose. To deal with the communication constraint problem, strategies such as the event-based communication and logarithmic quantization are applied. Furthermore, in a networked environment, the real-time information of the topology switching is not always available at the controller network side, hence a bunch of synchronous/asynchronous controllers are designed such that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable and achieves a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. Finally, an illustrative example on a benchmark continuous stirred-tank reactor system is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new control technique.

By using appropriate model transformation that shifts the considered systems into the neutral-type time-delay systems, adapting a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional which takes into account the range of time-delay, and by making use of some inequality techniques, delay-dependent criteria are developed to estimate the neuron states through available output measurements such that the estimation error system is globally asymptotically stable. The criteria are formulated in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be checked efficiently by use of some standard numerical packages.

Self-Evolving Neural Control for a Class of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Dynamic Systems With Unknown Dynamics and Unknown Disturbances	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS												In this article, a novel self-evolving general regression neural network (SEGRNN) is designed for tracking control of a class of discrete-time dynamic systems with unknown dynamics and unknown external disturbances. The proposed controller starts from scratch and automatically adjusts its structure and parameters online to solve the tracking control problem. The proposed controller can add, prune, and replace nodes online according to the control task, external disturbance, and the design specifications. A robustifying control term is also added to SEGRNN's output to mitigate the effects of the external disturbance. The concept of a data reservoir is proposed where a record of the deleted nodes is stored for any future recall, if they are seen to be significant again. Unlike most of the previously proposed self-evolving systems, our controller offers user-friendly design parameters to suit a variety of real-world systems. Lyapunov stability analysis is utilized to study the stability of the suggested controller and to determine an appropriate learning rate for the SEGRNN weights. A continuous stirred-tank reactor simulation example is employed to verify the performance of the proposed controller. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared with a variety of controllers, including adaptive radial basis functional networks, adaptive feed-forward neural networks, adaptive fuzzy logic system, proportional integral derivative controller, sliding-mode controller, and iterative learning controller. Finally, a dc motor platform is used to experimentally validate the controller performance.

Disturbance rejection of fractional-order T-S fuzzy neural networks based on quantized dynamic output feedback controller	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION												The disturbance rejection approach is employed for the stabilization of fractional-order neural networks described by Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model with dynamic output feedback controller under quantization. First, an equivalent continuous frequency distributed integral-order system is formulated for the fractional-order neural networks to estimate the system state. Specifically, the dynamic output feedback control with quantization is proposed and the measurement output is quantized by logarithmic quantizer before transmission. By employing an indirect Lyapunov approach and equivalent input disturbance (EID) technique, a set of newly established sufficient conditions with corresponding quantizer's dynamic parameters is obtained in the shape of LMIs to ensure the asymptotical stability of the considered fractional-order system.

Mathematical modeling for simultaneous design of plants and supply chain in the batch process industry	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Most supply chain design models have focused on the integration problem, where links among nodes must be settled in order to allow an efficient operation of the whole system. At this level, all the problem elements are modeled like black boxes, and the optimal solution determines the nodes allocation and their capacity, and links among nodes. In this work, a new approach is proposed where decisions about plant design are simultaneously made with operational and planning decisions on the supply chain. Thus, tradeoffs between the plant structure and the network design are assessed. The model considers unit duplications and the allocation of storage tanks for plant design. Using different sets of discrete sizes for batch units and tanks, a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is attained. The proposed formulation is compared with other non-integrated approaches in order to illustrate the advantages of the presented simultaneous approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Afshar, MH				Afshar, M. H.			Improving the efficiency of ant algorithms using adaptive refinement: Application to storm water Petwork design	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												The ant algorithm is a new evolutionary optimization method proposed for the solution of discrete combinatorial optimization problems. Many engineering optimization problems involve decision variables of continuous nature. Application of the ant algorithm to the optimization of these continuous problems requires discretization of the continuous search space, thereby reducing the underlying continuous problem to a discrete optimization problem. The level of discretization of the continuous search space, however, could present some problems. Generally, coarse discretization of the continuous design variables could adversely affect the quality of the final solution while finer discretization would enlarge the scale of the problem leading to higher computation cost and, occasionally, to low quality solutions. An adaptive refinement procedure is introduced in this paper as a remedy for the problem just outlined. The method is based on the idea of limiting the originally wide search space to a smaller one once a locally converged solution is obtained. The smaller search space is designed to contain the locally optimum solution at its center. The resulting search space is discretized and a completely new search is conducted to find a better solution. The procedure is continued until no improvement can be made by further refinement. The method is applied to a benchmark problem in storm water network design discipline and the results are compared with those of existing methods. The method is shown to be very effective and efficient regarding the optimality of the solution, and the convergence characteristics of the resulting ant algorithm. Furthermore, the method proves itself capable of finding an optimal, or near-optimal solution, independent of the discretization level and the size of the colony used. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Since proportional delay is unbounded and different from infinite-time distributed delay, the classical finite-time analytical techniques are not applicable anymore. First, a discontinuous state feedback controller is designed such that the delayed MNNs achieve drive-response synchronization in a finite settling time. By using Filippov solution and Lyapunov functional method, sufficient conditions are derived. It is shown that, though the proportional delay is unbounded, complete synchronization can still be realized and the settling time can be explicitly estimated. Second, a special adaptive controller is designed for the finite-time problem in order to reduce the control gains. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

A set of event-based state estimators is constructed so as to reduce unnecessary data transmissions in the communication channel. Compared with the traditional state estimator whose measurement signal is received under a periodic clock-driven rule, the event-based estimator only updates the measurement information from the sensors when the prespecified "event" is violated. Attention is focused on the analysis and design problem of the event-based estimators for the addressed discrete-time complex networks such that the estimation error is exponentially bounded in mean square. A combination of the stochastic analysis approach and Lyapunov theory is employed to obtain sufficient conditions for ensuring the existence of the desired estimators and the upper bound of the estimation error is also derived. By using the convex optimization technique, the gain parameters of the desired estimators are provided in an explicit form. Finally, a simulation example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation strategy.

Consider the estimation problem for delayed SNNs, the previously well-known Lyapunov-Krasovski functional (LKF) methods are devoted to constructing more and more complex functionals, in which each term is positive definite function. Hence it is difficult to solve and optimize in designing estimators. In this paper, the simple delay product type LKF with negative definite terms is established for the use of the Wirtinger based inequality together with mixed convex combination approach. The delay dependent conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained which lead to less conservative and more flexible estimator design results. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the merits over the existing ones.																			1062-922X		978-1-7281-8526-2				2020							656	661		10.1109/smc42975.2020.9283436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/smc42975.2020.9283436													WOS:000687430600101
J	Chen, TT; Li, XX				Chen, Tongtong; Li, Xiangxue			(Semi-)Automatically Parsing Private Protocols for In-Vehicle ECU Communications	ENTROPY												In-vehicle electronic control unit (ECU) communications generally count on private protocols (defined by the manufacturers) under controller area network (CAN) specifications. Parsing the private protocols for a particular vehicle model would be of great significance in testing the vehicle's resistance to various attacks, as well as in designing efficient intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) for the vehicle. This paper proposes a suite of methods for parsing ECU private protocols on in-vehicle CAN network. These methods include an algorithm for parsing discrete variables (encoded in a discrete manner, e.g., gear state), an algorithm for parsing continuous variables (encoded in a continuous manner, e.g., vehicle speed), and a parsing method based on upper-layer protocols (e.g., OBD and UDS). Extensive verifications have been performed on five different brands of automobiles (including an electric vehicle) to demonstrate the universality and the correctness of these parsing algorithms. Some parsing tips and experiences are also presented. Our continuous-variables parsing algorithm could run in a semi-automatic manner and the parsing algorithm from upper-layer protocols could execute in a completely automatic manner. One might view the results obtained by our parsing algorithms as an important indicator of penetration testing on in-vehicle CAN network.																				1099-4300				NOV	2021	23	11							1495	10.3390/e23111495	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e23111495								34828193					WOS:000725102000001

Precisely, the cyber attacks phenomenon in the network environment satisfies the Bernoulli distributed white noise sequences. Firstly, an asynchronous filter is constructed for estimating the unmeasured states of the system and the corresponding fault detection problem is formulated as a resilient filtering issue by which the error between residual and fault is minimized with a mixed H-infinity and passivity performance. Secondly, the sufficient criteria are derived to ensure the filtering error system to be asymptotically stable. Finally, the applicability and usefulness of the proposed filter design method is verified through a practical example.

The NECS is described by a set of continuous-time plant models and associated quadratic cost functions. Since the uncertainty of the computation and transmission delay affects the discretized plant models and cost functions in a nonlinear manner, a polytopic overapproximation of the uncertainty utilizing a Taylor series expansion is considered. For the resulting discrete-time switched system model with polytopic uncertainty, a periodic control and online scheduling (PCSon) strategy is proposed to guarantee stability and performance of the resulting controlled system. The design is based on a periodic parameter-dependent Lyapunov function and exhaustive search. Furthermore, a method for reducing the online complexity of the PCSon strategy is presented. The effectiveness of modeling and design is evaluated for networked embedded control of a set of inverted pendulums.

A novel hybrid consensus protocol with dynamically changing interaction topologies is designed to take the time-delay into account in both the continuous-time communication among agents and the instant information exchange at discrete-time moments. By using a new Halanay-type inequality and an auxiliary function, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the proposed consensus protocols lead to average-consensus.

J	Wang, SY; Bi, SZ; Zhang, YJA				Wang, Shuoyao; Bi, Suzhi; Zhang, Ying-Jun Angela			Deep Reinforcement Learning With Communication Transformer for Adaptive Live Streaming in Wireless Edge Networks	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS												The emerging mobile edge computing (MEC) technology has been recently applied to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of network services, such as live video streaming. In this paper, we study an energy-aware adaptive live streaming scheme in wireless edge networks. In particular, we aim to design a joint uplink transmission and edge transcoding algorithm maximizing the video followers' QoE, while minimizing the energy consumption of the video streamer. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework, named SACCT, to determine the streamer's encoding bitrate, the uploading power as well as the edge transcoding bitrates and frequency. We decompose the MDP problem into inter-frame and intra-frame problems to address the key design challenges that arise from continuous-discrete hybrid action space, time-varying state and action spaces, and unknown network variation. By doing so, SACCT integrates model-based optimization and model-free DRL to determine the intra-frame continuous resource allocation decisions and the inter-frame discrete bitrate adaptation decisions, respectively. To integrate both the numerical features (e.g., channel gain) and the categorical features (e.g., bitrate), we propose a communication Transformer (CT) as a backbone of SACCT by representing network states as communication tokens and running Transformers to model multi-scale dependencies. Extensive simulations manifest that compared with state-of-the-art approaches, SACCT can provide 128.23% (on average) extra reward. As such, by leveraging joint uplink adaption and edge transcoding, the proposed scheme enables an intelligent wireless network edge with QoE-assured and energy-aware live streaming services.

J	Hayashi, Y				Hayashi, Yoichi			Application of a rule extraction algorithm family based on the Re-RX algorithm to financial credit risk assessment from a Pareto optimal perspective	OPERATIONS RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES												Historically, the assessment of credit risk has proved to be both highly important and extremely difficult. Currently, financial institutions rely on the use of computer-generated credit scores for risk assessment. However, automated risk evaluations are currently imperfect, and the loss of vast amounts of capital could be prevented by improving the performance of computerized credit assessments. A number of approaches have been developed for the computation of credit scores over the last several decades, but these methods have been considered too complex without good interpretability and have therefore not been widely adopted. Therefore, in this study, we provide the first comprehensive comparison of results regarding the assessment of credit risk obtained using 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation of the Re-RX algorithm family, including the Re-RX algorithm, the Re-RX algorithm with both discrete and continuous attributes (Continuous Re-RX), the Re-RX algorithm with J48graft, the Re-RX algorithm with a trained neural network (Sampling Re-RX), NeuroLinear, NeuroLinear + GRG, and three unique rule extraction techniques involving support vector machines and Minerva from four real-life, two-class mixed credit-risk datasets. We also discuss the roles of various newly-extended types of the Re-RX algorithm and high performance classifiers from a Pareto optimal perspective. Our findings suggest that Continuous Re-RX, Re-RX with J48graft, and Sampling Re-RX comprise a powerful management tool that allows the creation of advanced, accurate, concise and interpretable decision support systems for credit risk evaluation. In addition, from a Pareto optimal perspective, the Re-RX algorithm family has superior features in relation to the comprehensibility of extracted rules and the potential for credit scoring with Big Data.

This paper analyzes a distribution network design problem for a four-echelon supply chain. The problem is represented as an inventory-location model with uncertain demand and a continuous review inventory policy. The decision variables include location at the intermediate levels and product flows between echelons. The related safety and cyclic inventory levels can be computed from these decision variables. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming model to find the optimal design of the distribution network. A linearization of the nonlinear model based on a piecewise linear approximation is proposed. The objective function and nonlinear constraints are reformulated as linear formulations, transforming the original nonlinear problem into a mixed integer linear programming model. The proposed approach was tested in 50 instances to compare the nonlinear and linear formulations. The results prove that the proposed linearization outperforms the nonlinear formulation achieving convergence to a better local optimum with shorter computational time. This method provides flexibility to the decision-maker allowing the analysis of scenarios in a shorter time.

Unlike the existing approaches where power of fronthaul is a quadratic or linear function of respective variables, we consider a more practical model where the power consumed by fronthaul depends on the rate served by the corresponding remote radio head (RRH). Then, we formulate a joint design of RRH selection, RRH-user association, and transmit beamforming for the problem of energy efficiency maximization. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex program, which is generally NP-hard. For this nonconvex program, we leverage successive convex approximation (SCA) method to develop efficient iterative algorithms to find a high performance. Particularly, we iteratively approximate the continuous nonconvex constraints by conic ones so that the problem obtained at each iteration is a mixed-integer second order cone programming (MI-SOCP) for which dedicated solvers are available. To further reduce the computational complexity, an algorithm based on continuous relaxation and post-processing is proposed. Results show that our proposed algorithms converge faster and outperform known solutions.

System Reliability Based Multi-Objective Design Optimization of Bridges	STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL												Continuous progress in structural reliability theory and methods, in addition to the evolving advances in optimization solution techniques, drives the steady development of reliability-based structural design process. The integration of system reliability in the design optimization of structures, especially bridges, improves the allocation of available, and usually scarce, budgets. However, the complexity in the determination of system reliability of large structural systems renders the consideration of system reliability in design optimization computationally prohibitive. This issue is even exacerbated when discrete design variables are considered. Furthermore, the optimization of structural systems typically requires using linked-discrete design variables. The recently developed matrix-based system reliability method (MSR) enables the computation of system reliability efficiently and accurately through convenient matrix calculations: The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with controlled elitism (NSGA-II) has proven its effectiveness and efficiency in numerous multi-objective optimization applications. The objective of this paper is to propose an approach for the system reliability-based multi-objective design optimization of bridges using the MSR method and NSGA-II and considering linked-discrete design variables. The approach is illustrated by redesigning an actual bridge in order to compare the results of the proposed approach with those of conventional bridge design.

Popular simulators are all based on discrete event simulation, and their performance does not scale with the size of modern networks. Recently, deep-learning-based techniques are introduced to solve the scalability problem, but, as we show with experiments, they have poor visibility in their simulation results, and cannot generalize to diverse scenarios. In this work, we combine scalable and generalized continuous simulation techniques with discrete event simulation to achieve high scalability, while providing packet-level visibility. We start from a solid queueing-theoretic modeling of modern networks, and carefully identify the mathematically-intractable or computationally-expensive parts, only which are then modeled using deep neural networks (DNN). Dubbed DeepQueueNet, our approach combines prior knowledge of networks, and supports arbitrary topology and device traffic management mechanisms (given sufficient training data). Our extensive experiments show that DeepQueueNet achieves near-linear speedup in the number of GPUs, and its estimation accuracy for average and 99th percentile round-trip time outperforms existing end-to-end DNN-based performance estimators in all scenarios.					baochun, Li/AAD-3188-2022																978-1-4503-9420-8				2022							441	457		10.1145/3544216.3544248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3544216.3544248													WOS:000859320200029

In the considered multi-UAV maritime IoT system, the UAVs act as the aerial base stations to complete the missions of data collection from buoys and data offloading to the offshore base station (OBS). In this case, the UAVs need to adaptively select the mission mode between data collection and data offloading according to the network resources and mission requirements. In this paper, we aimed to minimize the completion time of data collection and offloading missions for all UAVs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectories, mission mode selection, transmit power of buoys, and association relationships between the UAVs and buoy/OBS. In order to solve the mixed-integer non-convex minimization problem, we first designed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a hybrid discrete and continuous action space to preliminarily obtain the UAV trajectories, mission mode selection, and the transmit power of buoys. Then, we propose an algorithm based on the stable marriage problem to determine the buoy-UAV and UAV-OBS association relationships. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively shorten the total mission completion time of data collection and offloading for the multi-UAV-assisted maritime IoT system.

J	Sliseris, J; Rocens, K				Sliseris, Janis; Rocens, Karlis			Optimal design of composite plates with discrete variable stiffness	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES												A new optimization technique of composite plates with discrete varying stiffness is proposed. It consists of three main steps. Analysis of optimal continuous varying bending and shear stiffness of plate is done in the first step by minimizing structural compliance and stress field differences. Size optimization of discrete domains is done in the second step by solving minimization problem with a Genetic Algorithm. Dimension optimization of plates internal structure is done by previously trained feed-forward artificial neural network in the third step. A simply supported rectangular plate with uniformly distributed load and multispan plate with concentrated loads are optimized by the using of proposed method. The deflection of optimized plate could be reduced up to 50%, and average increase of strength to mass ratio is about 20%. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Feng, YM; Yang, XS; Song, Q; Cao, JD				Feng, Yuming; Yang, Xinsong; Song, Qiang; Cao, Jinde			Synchronization of memristive neural networks with mixed delays via quantized intermittent control	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION												It is well known that how to deal with the effect of time delay and how to determine the control and rest widths are the main difficulties for intermittent control. This paper considers asymptotic synchronization of drive-response memristive neural networks (MNNs) with bounded time-varying discrete delay and unbounded distributed delay (mixed delays), which extends existing intermittent control techniques and reveals new relationship between control width and rest width. A quantized intermittent control (QIC) is designed to save both channel resources and control cost and reduce both the amount of transmitted information and channel blocking. Based on weighted double-integral inequalities, novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals with negative terms are designed, which reduce the conservativeness of obtained results greatly. Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained to ensure the asymptotic synchronization. The control gains can also be designed by solving the LMIs. It is shown that the QIC can be neither periodic nor proportional between control width and rest width. Moreover, the relationships between control width, rest width, and convergence rate are explicitly given. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Guerrero-Lorente, J; Gabor, AF; Ponce-Cueto, E				Guerrero-Lorente, Javier; Gabor, Adriana F.; Ponce-Cueto, Eva			Omnichannel logistics network design with integrated customer preference for deliveries and returns	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING												This paper proposes a mixed integer program (MIP) for the network design problem of a parcel carrier that manages online orders from omnichannel retailers. The network includes several types of facilities, such as city distribution centers, intermediary depots, parcel offices, as well as collect channel points, such as automated parcel stations (APS), stores or kiosks. The model formulation takes into account the influence of these collection points on consumer choice and the maximum distance customers are willing to walk to reach them. Realistic transportation costs are also considered, including detailed long haul costs and delivery costs in an area. The transportation costs inside an area are estimated via the Continuous Approximation proposed by Newell (1971) and Newell (1973), which results in a simpler problem than a location-routing problem, however, at the cost of losing linearity. For a special case of the problem, we propose a heuristic that, in our experimental setting, is on average 42.5 faster than the overall MIP and gives solutions within 1.02% of the optimum. Finally, we use the model to discuss the network design of a Spanish parcel carrier operating in Madrid.

Such knowledge would have a potential impact on an expert system to this end, for instance, would help identify reliable topological parameters to characterize the desired behavior of the network. Feature selection from information theory is widely explored in many areas of expert and intelligent systems, and it is a suitable technique to choose such parameters. In optical networks, many signals are carried along the same fiber, each one with its wavelength. A possible desired performance is the minimal usage of different wavelengths, which can be influenced by many topological parameters established in the network design. However, it is difficult to determine the dependence between topological parameters and the number of wavelengths, because this latter addresses an NP-hard problem. We perform a comprehensive literature review to find topological metrics that are easier to compute and apply feature selection using a new mutual information estimator. Based on coincidence detection, this estimator is lightweight and easy-to-use and allows measuring the relevance between discrete and continuous features, without discretization nor estimating probability density functions. For this purpose, tests are performed using 315 topological parameters from graph theory and complex networks, in 15 real-world optical networks and 2.2 million random topologies that mimic real-world ones. The topological parameters are ranked based on its mutual information values, obtaining a set of the most influential for explaining the wavelength requirements. Among these parameters, as a result, the method highlights the ones derived from the edge betweenness. Moreover, some parameters proposed by the literature do not perform as expected. The results of this study can serve as a basis for new expert systems to design and expansion of optical networks, driven by the most relevant topological parameters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Günhan, BK; Friede, T; Held, L				Guenhan, Burak Kuersad; Friede, Tim; Held, Leonhard			A design-by-treatment interaction model for network meta-analysis and meta-regression with integrated nested Laplace approximations	RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS												Network meta-analysis (NMA) is gaining popularity for comparing multiple treatments in a single analysis. Generalized linear mixed models provide a unifying framework for NMA, allow us to analyze datasets with dichotomous, continuous or count endpoints, and take into account multiarm trials, potential heterogeneity between trials and network inconsistency. To perform inference within such NMA models, the use of Bayesian methods is often advocated. The standard inference tool is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which is computationally expensive and requires convergence diagnostics. A deterministic approach to do fully Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models can be achieved by integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), which is a fast and accurate alternative to MCMC. We show how NMA models fit in the class of latent Gaussian models and how NMA models are implemented using INLA and demonstrate that the estimates obtained by INLA are in close agreement with the ones obtained by MCMC. Specifically, we emphasize the design-by-treatment interaction model with random inconsistency parameters (also known as the Jackson model). Also, we have proposed a network meta-regression model, which is constructed by incorporating trial-level covariates to the Jackson model to explain possible sources of heterogeneity and/or inconsistency in the network. A publicly available R package, nmaINLA, is developed to automate the INLA implementation of NMA models, which are considered in this paper. Three applications illustrate the use of INLA for a NMA.

J	Dong, HL; Wang, ZD; Gao, HJ				Dong, Hongli; Wang, Zidong; Gao, Huijun			On design of quantized fault detection filters with randomly occurring nonlinearities and mixed time-delays	SIGNAL PROCESSING												This paper is concerned with the fault detection problem for a class of discrete-time systems with randomly occurring nonlinearities, mixed stochastic time-delays as well as measurement quantizations. The nonlinearities are assumed to occur in a random way. The mixed time-delays comprise both the multiple discrete time-delays and the infinite distributed delays that occur in a random way as well. A sequence of stochastic variables is introduced to govern the random occurrences of the nonlinearities, discrete time-delays and distributed time-delays, where all the stochastic variables are mutually independent but obey the Bernoulli distribution. The main purpose of this paper is to design a fault detection filter such that, in the presence of measurement quantization, the overall fault detection dynamics is exponentially stable in the mean square and, at the same time, the error between the residual signal and the fault signal is made as small as possible. Sufficient conditions are first established via intensive stochastic analysis for the existence of the desired fault detection filters, and then the explicit expression of the desired filter gains is derived by means of the feasibility of certain matrix inequalities. Also, the optimal performance index for the addressed fault detection problem can be obtained by solving an auxiliary convex optimization problem. A practical example is provided to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed design method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, a multi -functional aerogel with bi-continuous interpenetrating networks comprised of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and cellulose nanofiber (CNF) was developed via an "ice -dissolving" (freezing and solvent exchange) and subsequent annealing strategy. Different from the conventional step-by-step construction of two independent networks, the bi-continuous interpenetrating networks were simultaneously built in a one-step freezing process. Notably, the network structure of the aerogel can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of CNF (CCNF) during the freezing stage. When the CCNF increased from 2 to 8 wt%, the network structure transitioned from a single three-dimensional RGO skeleton to ordered bi-continuous interpenetrating networks, and then to a disordered CNF/RGO mixed network. The mutual contributions from the RGO skeleton and CNF network endowed the aerogel (14.96 mg cm -3) with improved conduct loss and optimized characteristic impedance, leading to an excellent microwave absorption capacity. Consequently, the aerogel achieved a maximum reflection loss of -68.3 dB and an effective bandwidth of 6.9 GHz, respectively. Moreover, the unique network structure also enabled the sample to have superior noise absorbing performance (normalized absorption coefficient of 0.894 in 250-6300 Hz) and good structural stability. This strategy provides a facile avenue for constructing multifunctional aerogels with bi-continuous interpenetrating networks for both microwave absorption and noise absorption applications.

J	Chang, CL				Chang, Chenglin			A mathematical model for refinery hydrogen network synthesis integrating multi-stage compressors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												The synthesis of refinery hydrogen network (HN) is generally performed under the assumption that compressors are single-stage ones. This assumption might overestimate the compression power, leading to deviation from the optimum designs. To tackle this problem, we integrate multi-stage compressors into hydrogen networks synthesis in the present work. The number of compression stages inside each compressor is defined as a variable which is simultaneously optimized with the network configurations. Taking advantage of the discrete nature of the defined stage variable, we linearize the constraint of compression power without losing generality. The proposed mathematical model for HN synthesis is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Three in-stances are conducted and the solution results show that the proposed model could be solved to global optimality. The total annualized costs of globally optimal solutions are 1.4-5.1% lower than those of the base solutions.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Tsai, ZR; Hwang, JD				Tsai, Zhi-Ren; Hwang, Jiing-Dong			<i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> Neural-Network-Based Discrete-Time Fuzzy Control of Continuous-Time Nonlinear Systems with Dither	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												This study presents an effective approach to stabilizing a continuous-time (CT) nonlinear system using dithers and a discrete-time (DT) fuzzy controller. ACT nonlinear system is first discretized to a DT nonlinear system. Then, a Neural-Network (NN) system is established to approximate a DT nonlinear system. Next, a Linear Difference Inclusion state-space representation is established for the dynamics of the NN system. Subsequently, a Takagi-Sugeno DT fuzzy controller is designed to stabilize this NN system. If the DT fuzzy controller cannot stabilize the NN system, a dither, as an auxiliary of the controller, is simultaneously introduced to stabilize the closed-loop CT nonlinear system by using the Simplex optimization and the linear matrix inequality method. This dither can be injected into the original CT nonlinear system by the proposed injecting procedure, and this NN system is established to approximate this dithered system. When the discretized frequency or sampling frequency of the CT system is sufficiently high, the DT system can maintain the dynamic of the CT system. We can design the sampling frequency, so the trajectory of the DT system and the relaxed CT system can be made as close as desired.																			1024-123X	1563-5147					2012	2012								314964	10.1155/2012/314964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/314964													WOS:000298626500001

This paper presents an optimization technique for water network synthesis in batch processing plants. The mathematical formulation is a mixed integer linear program (MLLP) based on the pinch-based automated targeting model (ATM) and a state task network (STN)-based discrete-time scheduling model. Embedding the ATM in the scheduling framework enables simultaneous process scheduling and water 30 minimization and the true minimum flow/cost targeting prior to detailed water network design. Two modified literature examples and an industrial case study on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing are solved to demonstrate the application of the proposed MILP model. Results for the PVC case study show that significant water (50-56%) and cost savings (61-67%) can be achieved through optimal production scheduling and water recovery.					Foo, Ir Dr Dominic C.

By projecting temperature information onto a fixed discrete temperature grid, the model remains linear even under variable temperatures and flow rates, leading to a more tractable optimization model. The proposed model is well suited to address problems in the area of process intensification where the close interaction between different phenomena naturally leads to process synthesis problems with unclassified process streams. Several extensions are presented, including nonisothermal mixing as well as phase changes. Furthermore, we show how a nonuniform grid can be adopted to reduce the complexity of the model for medium and large-size problems.

A double percolation network with co-continuous structure and filler distribution at the interface is constructed to design conductive polymer composites with low percolation threshold. The controllable distribution of CB at the interface is achieved by appropriate processing procedures involved mixing sequence and mixing time by taking advantage of the migration of CB from the unfavorable PLA phase to the favorable HDPE phase. Morphology characterization reveals that when the mixing time of the added HDPE is 3 min, the formation of co-continuous structure of PLA/HDPE (60/40, w/w) is observed, and CB particles migrate to the co-continuous interface. The electrical conductivity measurement shows that such double percolation conductive network reduces the percolation threshold of PLA/HDPE/CB to 2.42 wt%. The rheological property proves the establishment of particle percolation network, and the rheological percolation threshold is determined as 1.20 wt%. The prepared PLA/HDPE/CB composite by the two-step method displays a notably low percolation threshold than that prepared by one-step simultaneous mixing. Moreover, this strategy presents a high potential application in the fabrication of conductive polymer composites involving other miscible multiphase systems.						luo, yue/0000-0002-1679-068X													0021-8995	1097-4628				MAY 5	2021	138	17							e50291	10.1002/app.50291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/app.50291		NOV 2020											WOS:000590150200001

Sample Preparation with Free-Flowing Biochips Using Microfluidic Binary-Tree Network	2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS (ISCAS)	IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems				IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	OCT 10-21, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE				Microfluidic biochips enable low-cost automation of biochemical protocols with numerous applications to medical diagnostics, forensics, molecular biology, and drug design. An important component of protocol design is sample preparation, which involves dilution or mixing of two or more fluids in a desired ratio of concentration factors (CF). Existing continuous flow microfluidic biochips deploy either free-flowing networks where only a single layer of flow-channels is used devoid of any control valves, or valve-based technology where the flow-layer is augmented with a control layer of valves. While the former is easy to fabricate, reliable, and less expensive, they are typically hardwired for specific applications only. The latter class, although programmable, is expensive and prone to various manufacturing and operational defects. In this paper, we present the physical design of a microfluidic network that is free-flowing as well as programmable. The proposed valve-free network resembles a complete binary tree with serpentine obstacles embedded within its channels, and can be used to achieve a desired dilution of a sample just by proper selection of fluid concentrations to be fed as inputs under constant pressure. Simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics Software shows that the proposed network provides a powerful and versatile architecture for solution preparation with minimal control, outperforming prior approaches in terms of the accuracy of CFs and time for convergence.

The proposed hybrid automaton consists of two discrete states, each with continuous dynamics: a regulation state and a formation keeping state. The controller in the regulation state is designed to drive the agent to a goal position while the formation keeping controller ensures that the agents achieve a specified geometric formation prior to reaching their goal-position. The proposed controller creates hybrid dynamics from the interactions between the continuous and discrete states. The analysis and design of hybrid systems is generally more difficult than that of purely discrete or purely continuous systems since the discrete dynamics may affect the continuous evolution and vice versa. Therefore, the stability of the hybrid approach is proven by using multiple Lyapunov functions and also considers the switching conditions between the regulation and the formation states. The Lyapunov based approach demonstrates that the formation errors converge to a small bounded region around the origin and the size of the bound can be adjusted by using the switching conditions. Convergence to goal position while in formation is also demonstrated in the same Lyapunov analysis, and simulation results verify the theoretical conjectures.																			0743-1619	2378-5861	978-1-4799-8684-2				2015							4386	4391																WOS:000370259204081

Existing attributed network embedding models are designed either in continuous Euclidean spaces which introduce data redundancy or in binary coding spaces which incur significant loss of representation accuracy. To this end, we present a new Low-Bit Quantization for Attributed Network Representation Learning model (LQANR for short) that can learn compact node representations with low bitwidth values while preserving high representation accuracy. Specifically, we formulate a new representation learning function based on matrix factorization that can jointly learn the low-bit node representations and the layer aggregation weights under the low-bit quantization constraint. Because the new learning function falls into the category of mixed integer optimization, we propose an efficient mixed-integer based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm as the solution. Experiments on real-world node classification and link prediction tasks validate the promising results of the proposed LQANR model.

Jay			Economical Caching for Scalable Videos in Cache-Enabled Heterogeneous Networks	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS												We develop the optimal economical caching schemes in cache-enabled heterogeneous networks, while delivering multimedia video services with personalized viewing qualities to mobile users. By applying scalable video coding (SVC), each video file to be requested is divided into one base layer (BL) and several enhancement layers (ELs). In order to assign different transmission tasks, the serving small-cell base stations (SBSs) are grouped into K clusters. The SBSs are able to cache and cooperatively transmit BL and EL contents to the user. We analytically derive expressions for successful transmission probability and ergodic service rate, and then the closed-form expression for EConomical Efficiency (ECE) is obtained. In order to enhance the ECE performance, we formulate the ECE optimization problems for two cases. In the first case, with equal cache size equipped at each SBS, the layer caching indicator is determined. Since this problem is NP-hard, after the l(0)-norm approximation, the discrete optimization variables are relaxed to be continuous, and this relaxed problem is convex. Next, based on the optimal solution derived from the relaxed problem, we devise a greedy-strategy based heuristic algorithm to achieve the near-optimal layer caching indicators. In the second case, the cache size for each SBS, the layer size, and the layer caching indicator are jointly optimized. This problem is a mixed integer programming problem, which is more challenging. To effectively solve this problem, the original ECE maximization problem is divided into two subproblems. These two subproblems are iteratively solved until the original optimization problem is convergent. Numerical results verify the correctness of the theoretical derivations. Additionally, compared to the most popular layer placement strategy, the performance superiority of the proposed SVC-based caching schemes is testified.

J	Chen, YX; Lu, XQ				Chen, Yaxiong; Lu, Xiaoqiang			Deep discrete hashing with pairwise correlation learning	NEUROCOMPUTING												Hashing technology plays an important role in large-scale visual search due to its low memory and fast retrieval speed. Most existing deep hashing approaches first leverage the continuous relaxation strategy to learn continuous approximate codes, and then transform them into discrete hash codes by separating quantization operations, which results in the suboptimal problem of hash codes and ultimately affects the performance of image retrieval. To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep discrete hashing approach with pairwise labels, namely Pairwise Correlation Discrete Hashing (PCDH), to leverage the pairwise correlation of deep features and semantic supervised information to directly guide discrete hashing codes learning. Firstly, we integrate discrete hash code learning and deep features learning in a unified network framework, which can utilize the semantic supervision to guide discrete hash codes learning. Secondly, we design a novel pairwise correlation constraint to perform pairwise correlation learning of deep features. Thirdly, we develop a novel pairwise construction module to mine good pairwise samples for discrete hash codes learning. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed PCDH approach achieves superior performance over other recent state-of-the-art hashing approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Three new robust stability bounds on the time-invariant perturbations to the original continuous-time plant matrix are presented guaranteeing stability for the corresponding discrete closed-loop augmented delay-free system (ADFS) with multiple time-varying sensor and actuator delays. The bounds are differentiated from previous work by accounting for the sampled-data nature of the NCS and for separate communication delays for each sensor and actuator, not a single delay. Therefore, this paper expands the knowledge base in multiple inputs multiple outputs (MIMO) sampled-data time delay systems. Bounds are presented for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured perturbations.

C	Brenner, A; Khorramfar, R; Amin, S			ACM	Brenner, Aron; Khorramfar, Rahman; Amin, Saurabh			Learning Spatio-Temporal Aggregations for Large-Scale Capacity Expansion Problems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2023 ACM/IEEE 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS, WITH CPS-IOTWEEK 2023					14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) part of CPS-IoT Week	MAY 09-12, 2023	San Antonio, TX	IEEE, Assoc Comp Machinery, IEEE TCRTS, ACM SIGBED				Effective investment planning decisions are crucial to ensure that critical cyber-physical infrastructures satisfy performance requirements over an extended time horizon. Computing these decisions often requires solving Capacity Expansion Problems (CEPs). In the context of regional-scale energy systems, these problems are prohibitively expensive to solve owing to large network sizes, heterogeneous node characteristics (e.g., electric power and natural gas energy vectors), and a large number of operational periods. To maintain tractability, traditional approaches resort to aggregating network nodes and/or selecting a set of representative time periods. Often, these reductions do not capture the supply-demand variations that crucially impact the CEP costs and constraints, leading to suboptimal decisions. Here, we propose a novel graph convolutional autoencoder approach for spatiotemporal aggregation of a generic CEP with heterogeneous nodes (CEPHN). Our autoencoder architecture leverages graph pooling to identify nodes with similar characteristics and minimizes a multi-objective loss function. This loss function is specifically tailored to induce desirable spatial and temporal aggregations in terms of tractability and optimality of CEPHN. In particular, the output of the graph pooling provides a spatial aggregation while clustering the low-dimensional encoded representations yields a temporal aggregation. We apply our approach to generation expansion planning of coupled power and natural gas system in New England. The resulting spatiotemporal aggregation leads to a simpler CEPHN with 6 nodes (as opposed to 88 nodes in the original system) and a small set of representative days selected from a full year. We evaluate aggregation outcomes over a range of hyperparameters governing the loss function, and compare resulting upper bounds on the original problem with those obtained using previously known methods. The results from our case study show that this approach provides solutions that are 33% (resp. 10%) better those than obtained from standard spatial (resp. temporal) aggregation approaches.						/0000-0003-1554-015X; , Aron/0000-0002-9286-7212; Khorramfar, Rahman/0000-0002-7802-7460															979-8-4007-0036-1				2023							68	77		10.1145/3576841.3585920	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3576841.3585920													WOS:001117681000007

For the sake of technical simplicity, only two different sampling periods are considered, their occurrence probabilities are given constants and satisfy Bernoulli distribution, and can be extended to the case with multiple stochastic sampling periods. By the way of an input delay, the probabilistic system is transformed into a stochastic continuous time-delay system. A new linear matrix inequality-based procedure is proposed for designing state-feedback controllers, which would guarantee that the closed-loop networked system with stochastic sampling tracks the output of a given reference model well in the sense of H. Conservatism is reduced by taking the probability into account. Both network-induced delays and packet dropouts have been considered. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed H output tracking design.

In this Letter we introduce an algorithm to infer the intrinsic dimension (ID) of datasets embedded in discrete spaces. We demonstrate its accuracy on benchmark datasets, and we apply it to analyze a metagenomic dataset for species fingerprinting, finding a surprisingly small ID, of order 2.

The idea to deal with proportional delays is to propose a class of q-type allowable time scales on which we design an appropriate controller to achieve exponential synchronization based on a calculus theory on time scales and Lyapunov function/functional methods. It is shown that adopting properties of q-type time scales is an effective approach to establish synchronization for the networks with proportional delays. This helps us to have insight into the synchronization problems on general intermittent time domain. Finally, simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

As one crucial factor to determine the processing ability of nodes, the information flow with potential time lag is modeled by co-processing diffusion which couples the continuous time processing and the discrete diffusing dynamics. Exact results on master equation and stationary state are achieved to disclose the formation. In order to understand the evolution of the co-processing and design the optimal routing strategy according to the maximal entropic diffusion on networks, we propose the coupling entropy comprehending the structural characteristics and information propagation on social network. Based on the analysis of the co-processing model, we analyze the coupling impact of the structural factor and information propagating factor on the coupling entropy, where the analytical results fit well with the numerical ones on scale-free social networks.																			0217-9849	1793-6640				SEP 20	2015	29	25							1550149	10.1142/S0217984915501493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217984915501493													WOS:000361752200008

First, a discrete-time version of periodic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed, under which the sensors sample the signals in a periodic manner. But whether the sampling signals are transmitted to controllers or not is determined by a predefined periodic ETM. Compared with the common ETMs in the field of discrete-time systems, the proposed method avoids monitoring the measurements point-to-point and enlarges the lower bound of the inter-event intervals. As a result, it is beneficial to save both the energy and communication resources. Second, the ``discontinuous'' Lyapunov functionals are constructed to deal with the sawtooth constraint of sampling signals. The functionals can be viewed as the discrete-time extension for those discontinuous ones in continuous-time fields. Third, sufficient conditions for the ultimately bounded synchronization are derived for the discrete-time CDNs with or without considering communication delays, respectively. A calculation method for simultaneously designing the triggering parameter and control gains is developed such that the estimation of error level is accurate as much as possible. Finally, the simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed method.

Although many optimization techniques have been developed to solve an SDP problem, they use too many binary variables to reformulate the problem for finding a globally optimal solution or can only derive a local or an approximate solution. This article proposes a global optimization method to solve an SDP problem by integrating an efficient linear expression of single variable discrete functions and convexification techniques. An SDP problem can be converted into a convex mixed-integer programming problem solvable to obtain a global optimum. Several illustrative examples are also presented to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method.																			0305-215X	1029-0273					2010	42	9					833	843	PII 923050149	10.1080/03052150903456485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03052150903456485													WOS:000281156900003

In this paper, we develop novel queuing network models to estimate the performance of both single-tier and multitier shuttle-based compact systems. Each tier is modeled as a multiclass semi-open queuing network, whereas the vertical transfer is modeled using an open queue. For a multitier system, the models corresponding to tiers and vertical transfer are linked together using the first and second moment information of the queue departure processes. The models can handle both specialized and generic shuttles and both continuous and discrete lifts. The accuracy of the models is validated through both simulation and a real case. Errors are acceptable for conceptualizing initial designs. Numerical studies provide new design insights. Results show that the best way to minimize expected throughput time in single-tier systems is to have a depth/width ratio around 1.25. Moreover, specialized shuttles are recommended for multitier systems because the higher cost of generic shuttles is not balanced by savings in reduced throughput time and equipment needs.

Different from the input delay approach used in some existing literature, the continuous-time system under consideration is first converted into a discrete-time stochastic system with system matrices subject to stochastic characteristic. In order to deal with the difficulties in the calculations of mathematical expectations of both matrix exponential and integral of matrix exponential function, the upper bound of successive packet losses and packet drop rate are assumed to be known and then the probabilities of the number of successive packet losses taking each value in a bounded set are calculated. Based on this, stability criteria are derived by recurring to the law of total expectation, which guarantee the exponential mean-square stability of resulting closed-loop discrete-time stochastic system with a prescribed H-infinity performance. Moreover, a controller design procedure is then proposed. Finally, to verify the analysis results and testify the effectiveness and applicability of the designed algorithm, a numerical simulation example is given.

To develop the solution method, an accelerated sample average approximation approach is combined with an accelerated Benders' decomposition algorithm. The accelerated sample average approximation approach improves the main structure of the original technique through the reduction in the number of mixed integer programming problems that need to be solved. Furthermore, the recently accelerated Benders' decomposition approach is utilized to expedite the solution time of the mixed integer programming problems. In order to examine the performance of the proposed solution method, the computational experiments are performed on developed stochastic supply chain network design problems. The computational results show that the accelerated solution method solves these problems efficiently. The synergy of the two accelerated approaches improves the computational procedure by an average factor of over 42%, and over 12% in comparison with the original and the recently modified methods, respectively. Moreover, the betterment of the computational process increases substantially with the size of the problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Multistable Discrete Memristor and Its Application to Discrete-Time FitzHugh-Nagumo Model	ELECTRONICS												This paper presents a multistable discrete memristor that is based on the discretization of a continuous-time model. It has been observed that the discrete memristor model is capable of preserving the characteristics of the continuous memristor model. Furthermore, a three-dimensional memristor discrete-time FitzHugh-Nagumo model is constructed by integrating the discrete memristor into a two-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN) neuron model. Subsequently, the dynamic behavior of the proposed neuron model is analyzed through Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, and bifurcation diagrams. The results show multiple kinds of coexisting hidden attractor behaviors generated by this neuron model.

The array of neural networks are coupled in a random fashion which is governed by Bernoulli random variable. The aim of this paper is to obtain the synchronization criteria, which is suitable for both exactly known and partly unknown transition probabilities such that the coupled neural network is synchronized with mixed time-delay. The considered impulsive effects can be synchronized at partly unknown transition probabilities. Besides, a multiple integral approach is also proposed to strengthen the Markovian jumping randomly coupled neural networks with partly unknown transition probabilities. By making use of Kronecker product and some useful integral inequalities, a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional was designed for handling the coupled neural network with mixed delay and then impulsive synchronization criteria are solvable in a set of linear matrix inequalities.

Graph representation learning has emerged as an effective strategy for analyzing such networks. However, the problem lies in the fact that many current techniques treat dynamic networks as static or discrete structures, while continuous-time approaches often lack the capabilities to effectively handle networks with low node repetition behavior. To alleviate these problems, we first treat dynamic networks as continuous-time interactions and then propose a novel method for the transductive interaction prediction task. Our approach incorporates two key aspects: 1) evolutionary expectation learning and 2) temporal dynamic learning. The former imparts guidance to the network's evolution and endows node embedding with a more profound wealth of information, while the latter provides detailed insight into the intricate process of network evolution. Together, these two components provide a comprehensive understanding of network behavior and can efficiently handle dynamic networks with low node repetition behavior. Specifically, we utilize an asynchronous training process, starting with the training of a multievent embedding module that captures information about the evolutionary expectation of dynamic networks. Based on this foundation, we train a temporal multievent embedding module to map the network's dynamic evolution onto node embedding representations. Furthermore, we design a temporal single-event module that effectively captures implicit long-term interaction dependencies of nodes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we evaluate its performance on four data sets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to the baselines.																			2379-8920	2379-8939				JUN	2024	16	3					840	849		10.1109/TCDS.2023.3305285	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2023.3305285													WOS:001247154200018

In this paper, we present our attempt to understand the impact and inevitable symptom of wormholes and develop distributed detection methods by making as few restrictions and assumptions as possible. We fundamentally analyze the wormhole problem using a topology methodology and propose an effective distributed approach, which relies solely on network connectivity information, without any requirements on special hardware devices or any rigorous assumptions on network properties.

This contribution puts forward an approach for user-optimal dynamic assignment in continuous time and space for analyzing for instance walking infrastructure in a two-dimensional space. Contrary to network-based approaches, the theory allows the traffic units to choose from an infinite non-countable set of paths through the considered space. The approach first determines the continuous paths using a path choice model. Then, origin-destination flows are assigned and traffic conditions are calculated. The approach to determine a user-optimal assignment is heuristic and consists of a sequence of all-or-nothing assignments. An application example is presented, showing dynamic user equilibrium traffic flows through a realistic transfer station. The example is aimed at illustrating the dynamic aspects of the modeling approach, such as anticipation on expected flow conditions, and predicted behavior upon catching or missing a connection.

Given path-based side constraint structures, we proposed two variational inequality (VI) formulations for modeling discrete and continuous RTAPs, where the former is finite-dimensional according to a discrete number of user classes and the latter is infinite-dimensional accounting for an infinite number of user classes. We reformulate the continuous RTAP into finite-dimensional by merging adjacent EV drivers into one group. A unified path-based solution framework is developed to solve the two RTAPs, built upon the gradient projection algorithm. We design column generation and dropping schemes to adaptively maintain compact path sets and an inner equilibration strategy to accelerate convergence. Finally, a small network is used to examine the correctness and effectiveness of proposed models, and a large Winnipeg network is adopted to evaluate the impacts of stochastic driving range on network flows and computation costs. Numerical results provide compelling evidence of the outstanding superiority of the proposed algorithm, and show that EV drivers with heightened sensitivity towards range anxiety may contribute to the emergence of critical links experiencing severe congestion.

J	Lee, S; Grossmann, IE				Lee, S; Grossmann, IE			Global optimization of nonlinear generalized disjunctive programming with bilinear equality constraints: applications to process networks	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												A global optimization method is proposed for the solution of nonconvex generalized disjunctive programming problems that have bilinear equality constraints in terms of flows, compositions and split fractions. Tight convex under/over estimators are introduced for the relaxation of nonconvex constraints to construct the lower bound problem. Discrete choices for process networks are expressed as disjunctions, which are relaxed by a convex hull formulation. The relaxed convex NLP problem is solved with a two-level branch and bound algorithm proposed by Lee and Grossmann (Comput. Chem. Eng. 25 (2001) 1675), which branches on the discrete variables at the first level and the continuous variables on the second level. This global optimization algorithm is guaranteed to find an F-optimal solution in a finite number of steps. Applications are presented in pooling problems, wastewater network problems, and water usage network problems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Modeling all alternative solutions for highly renewable energy systems	ENERGY												As the world is transitioning towards highly renewable energy systems, advanced tools are needed to analyze the complex energy networks. Energy system design is, however, challenged by real-world objective functions consisting of a blurry mix of technical and socioeconomic agendas, with limitations that cannot always be clearly stated. As a result, economically suboptimal solutions will likely be preferable. Here, a method capable of determining the continuum containing all economically near optimal solutions is presented, moving the field of energy system modeling from discrete solutions to a new era where continuous solution ranges are available. The proposed method is applied to study a range of technical and socioeconomic metrics on a model of the European electricity system. The near optimal region is found to be relatively flat allowing for solutions that are slightly more expensive than the optimum but better in terms of equality, land use, and implementation time.

Birgitta			Machine learning for continuous quantum error correction on superconducting qubits	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS												Continuous quantum error correction has been found to have certain advantages over discrete quantum error correction, such as a reduction in hardware resources and the elimination of error mechanisms introduced by having entangling gates and ancilla qubits. We propose a machine learning algorithm for continuous quantum error correction that is based on the use of a recurrent neural network to identify bit-flip errors from continuous noisy syndrome measurements. The algorithm is designed to operate on measurement signals deviating from the ideal behavior in which the mean value corresponds to a code syndrome value and the measurement has white noise. We analyze continuous measurements taken from a superconducting architecture using three transmon qubits to identify three significant practical examples of non-ideal behavior, namely auto-correlation at temporal short lags, transient syndrome dynamics after each bit-flip, and drift in the steady-state syndrome values over the course of many experiments. Based on these real-world imperfections, we generate synthetic measurement signals from which to train the recurrent neural network, and then test its proficiency when implementing active error correction, comparing this with a traditional double threshold scheme and a discrete Bayesian classifier. The results show that our machine learning protocol is able to outperform the double threshold protocol across all tests, achieving a final state fidelity comparable to the discrete Bayesian classifier.

The mixed delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays, and the nonlinearity under consideration is subject to sector-bounded condition. Both the the fuzzy-rule-dependent and fuzzy-rule-independent filters are considered. Based on discrete Jensen inequality and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach combined with the S-procedure, sufficient conditions for the existence of admissible filters are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which ensure the asymptotical mean-square stability as well as a prescribed H infinity performance.

J	Crudu, A; Debussche, A; Radulescu, O				Crudu, Alina; Debussche, Arnaud; Radulescu, Ovidiu			Hybrid stochastic simplifications for multiscale gene networks	BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY												Background: Stochastic simulation of gene networks by Markov processes has important applications in molecular biology. The complexity of exact simulation algorithms scales with the number of discrete jumps to be performed. Approximate schemes reduce the computational time by reducing the number of simulated discrete events. Also, answering important questions about the relation between network topology and intrinsic noise generation and propagation should be based on general mathematical results. These general results are difficult to obtain for exact models. Results: We propose a unified framework for hybrid simplifications of Markov models of multiscale stochastic gene networks dynamics. We discuss several possible hybrid simplifications, and provide algorithms to obtain them from pure jump processes. In hybrid simplifications, some components are discrete and evolve by jumps, while other components are continuous. Hybrid simplifications are obtained by partial Kramers-Moyal expansion [1-3] which is equivalent to the application of the central limit theorem to a sub-model. By averaging and variable aggregation we drastically reduce simulation time and eliminate non-critical reactions. Hybrid and averaged simplifications can be used for more effective simulation algorithms and for obtaining general design principles relating noise to topology and time scales. The simplified models reproduce with good accuracy the stochastic properties of the gene networks, including waiting times in intermittence phenomena, fluctuation amplitudes and stationary distributions. The methods are illustrated on several gene network examples. Conclusion: Hybrid simplifications can be used for onion-like (multi-layered) approaches to multiscale biochemical systems, in which various descriptions are used at various scales. Sets of discrete and continuous variables are treated with different methods and are coupled together in a physically justified approach.

It is assumed that the output information of the drive system is only available at discrete instants, and the dynamics of the response system are subject to external disturbance. To achieve H-infinity synchronization, an impulsive synchronization strategy is proposed which is based on feedback from the sampled-data of the drive and response dynamics. Novel time-dependent Lyapunov function/functional methods are developed for L-2-gain analysis of synchronization error systems, both for fast-varying delays and for slowly-varying delays. LMI-based optimization methods are suggested to design impulsive H-infinity synchronization controllers with minimized feedback gain.

Considering the NP-completeness of the clustering problem, numerous meta-heuristic algorithms are provided in the literature for the clustering of WSNs. Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) is an optimization algorithm employed to tackle continuous optimization problems. In this paper, a novel discrete version of the TLBO algorithm is being presented that employs the swap and mutation operators to deal with discrete solutions. Subsequently, the new-fangled algorithm was utilized to design a hierarchical energy-aware clustering scheme for the WSNs to minimize the energy usage of the sensor nodes. In addition, an energy-aware local search algorithm was provided to enhance the network lifetime by taking factors such as energy and distance into account. Extensive simulations are conducted to indicate the effectiveness of this scheme in reducing the power usage of the sensor nodes and improving the WSN lifetime.

This paper aims to find a fast-converging and high-precision method for solving time-varying equations. We combine two classes of feedback neural networks, i.e., gradient neural network (GNN) and Zhang neural network (ZNN), to construct a continuous gradient-Zhang neural network (GZNN) model. Our research shows that GZNN has the advantages of high convergence precision of ZNN and fast convergence speed of GNN in certain cases, i.e., all the eigenvalues of Jacobian matrix of the time-varying equations multiplied by its transpose are larger than 1. Furthermore, we conduct the different detailed mathematical proof and theoretical analysis to establish the stability and convergence of the GZNN model. Additionally, we discretize the GZNN model by utilizing time discretization formulas (i.e., Euler and Taylor-Zhang discretization formulas), to construct corresponding discrete GZNN algorithms for solving discrete time-varying problems. Different discretization formulas can construct discrete algorithms with varying precision. As the number of time sampling instants increases, the precision of discrete algorithms can be further improved. Furthermore, we improve the matrix inverse operation in the GZNN model and develop inverse-free GZNN algorithms to solve linear problems, effectively reducing their time complexity. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility of GZNN model and the corresponding discrete algorithms in solving time-varying equations, as well as the efficiency of the inverse-free method in solving linear equations.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-981-99-8078-9; 978-981-99-8079-6				2024	14447						277	291		10.1007/978-981-99-8079-6_22	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-8079-6_22													WOS:001148052300022

Discrete-time control systems can be further classified into two categories based on the sampling: (1) time-triggered control systems and (2) event-triggered control systems. Time-triggered systems sample states and calculate controls at every sampling instant in a periodic fashion, even in cases when states and calculated control do not change much. This indicates unnecessary and useless data transmission and computation efforts of a time-triggered system, thus inefficiency. For networked systems, the transmission of measurement and control signals, thus, cause unnecessary network traffic. Event-triggered systems, on the other hand, have potential to reduce the communication burden in addition to reducing the computation of control signals. This paper provides an up-to-date survey on the event-triggered methods for control systems and highlights the potential research directions.

J	Cordone, R; Redaelli, F				Cordone, Roberto; Redaelli, Francesco			Optimizing the demand captured by a railway system with a regular timetable	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												The railway systems in various European countries adopt regular timetables, in which the trains arrive and depart at constant intervals. In fact, their simple structure provides several advantages both to the passengers and to the management of the service. The design of such timetables has recently received a certain attention in the literature, but the standard model aims to optimize the service for a fixed demand. We relax this unrealistic assumption, taking into account the reciprocal influence between the quality of the timetable and the amount of transport demand captured by the railway. This results into a mixed-integer non linear model with a non-convex continuous relaxation. We solve it by a branch-and-bound algorithm based on a piecewise-linear overestimate of the objective function and a heuristic algorithm which iteratively applies the standard fixed-demand model and a demand-estimation model, feeding each one with data based on the solution obtained from the other one at the previous iteration. The computational results presented concern both random instances and a real-world regional network located in Northwestern Italy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The system is analysed using a discrete time interval approach, assuming an exponential decay in membrane permeability and perfect regeneration at cleaning. The scheduling problem was solved as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem using both (i) fixed network configurations and (ii) a flexible network superstructure. In the fixed network analysis, both the number of modules per unit in each stage and the optimal cleaning schedules were determined simultaneously. An initial investigation of linear networks found that a two-stage network was more attractive than single and three stage networks. Eleven two-stage network configurations were subsequently studied: 1:1, 2:2 and 2:1 networks gave the best performance. Further investigation indicated that a tapered-flow 2:1 network yielded a marginally better total cost. The scheduling and cost results were very sensitive to the form of the cost model used. In the flexible superstructure approach, the network configuration, number of units and operating schedule were all determined simultaneously. This approach identified the 1:1 configuration as the optimal design but the total cost calculated was 1.4% higher than that obtained in the fixed network analysis. This stimultaneous superstructure approach was found to consistently converge on networks with larger numbers of modules;md hence larger total costs.

The recently introduced Mixed Deep Gaussian Mixture Models (MDGMM) explicitly handle such different variable types. MDGMMs learn continuous and low dimensional representations of mixed datasets that capture the inter-variable dependence structure. We propose a model inversion that uses the learned latent representation and maps it with the observed parts of the signal. Latent areas of interest are identified for each missing value using an optimization method and synthetic imputation values are drawn.

Multi-commodity Multimodal Splittable Logistics Hub Location Problem with Stochastic Demands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING												This study presents a multimodal hub location problem which has the capability to split commodities by limited-capacity hubs and transportation systems, based on the assumption that demands are stochastic for multi-commodity network flows. In the real world cases, demands are random over the planning horizon and those which are partially fulfilled, are lost. Thus, the present study handles demands using a discrete chance constraint programming to make the model one step closer to the reality. On the other hand, commodity splitting makes it possible for the remaining portion of commodity flow to be transported by another hub or transportation system in such a way that demands are completely fulfilled as much as possible. The problem decides on the optimum location of hubs, allocates spokes to established hubs efficiently, adopts and combines transportation systems and then makes a right decision as to whether transportation infrastructure to be built at points lacking a suitable transportation infrastructure and having the potential for infrastructure establishment. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is formulated with the aim of cost minimization. Also, the proposed sensitivity analysis shows that, the discrete chance constraint programming is a good approximation of the continuous chance constraint programming when an uncertain parameter follows a normal distribution. The results indicate the higher accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model comparing with other models presented in the literature.

Because the starting and finishing times of batch water-using tasks are dependent on the production schedule as the inherent time dependence in batch processes, storage facilities are commonly equipped for the temporary storage of reusable water to partially bypass the time limitation. With a fixed production schedule, this paper presents a mathematical formulation for the synthesis of water-using networks in batch plants. Superstructures that incorporate all possible flow connections are built for modeling the batch water system, The proposed formulation is based on a continuous-time representation where different design objectives have been considered for an applicable network configuration. The design problems for the minimization of freshwater consumption, storage capacity, and the amount of connecting flows are formulated its nonlinear programs (NLPs), whereas the design problem for minimizing the number of connections will be a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Representative examples from literature are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed formulation. Furthermore, the application of a fictitious contaminant is also developed. to address the forbidden match between assigned water-using tasks.

Among various biological signals, the surface electromyogram (sEMG)-the signal of actions potential superimposed on the surface of the skin containing the temporal and spatial information-is one of the best signals with which to extract human motion intentions. However, most of the current sEMG control methods can only perform discrete motion estimation, and thus fail to meet the requirements of continuous motion estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel method that applies a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to sEMG-based continuous estimation. After analyzing the relationship between the convolutional kernel's size and the lengths of atomic segments (defined in this paper), we propose a large-scale temporal convolutional network (LS-TCN) to overcome the TCN's problem: that it is difficult to fully extract the sEMG's temporal features. When applying our proposed LS-TCN with a convolutional kernel size of 1 x 31 to continuously estimate the angles of the 10 main joints of fingers (based on the public dataset Ninapro), it can achieve a precision rate of 71.6%. Compared with TCN (kernel size of 1 x 3), LS-TCN (kernel size of 1 x 31) improves the precision rate by 6.6%.

For the sake of simplicity, a virtual neuron can be introduced to eliminate the influence of distributed delay, and a new equivalent system containing only one delay is obtained to study the bifurcation control problem of the initial neural network model with mixed delay. A PD controller is designed, and the leakage delay is used as the analysis variable. By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations, the conditions for the existence of Hopf bifurcation are derived. In addition, the critical value is changed by regulating the control variable of PD feedback controller to achieve the desired dynamic behavior. The theoretical analysis is verified by numerical examples, and it is proved that the method can control the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the system.

The panels considered are standardized to some extent but still there is a wide scope of discrete and continuous design variables that can be adjusted to increase performance or reduce structural weight. A NN is trained for every panel configuration using a backpropagation algorithm with data sets taken from finite element analyses spread randomly over the design space. The trained network is then used to predict the values of the constraint functions (strain and buckling multipliers). The approach is formulated in this manner to maintain maximum flexibility regarding the implementation of new variables or models and with the prospect of optimizing the assembly as a whole. Results show that in design problems with high dimensionality the approach becomes more attractive, especially when the optimization has to be run repeatedly for panels under different loading/sizing conditions. The optimization algorithm has proven to be robust though dependent on the smoothness of the network output function. A modified method that feeds back the found optima is proposed to improve accuracy of the NN and decrease preparation time.																					0-08-044046-0				2003							2359	2363																WOS:000184938200577

Unlike the continuous-time analysis, literature on discrete-time analysis and control of NCSs under packet delay and dropout shows a variety of different models. However, a systematic study of these models is absent in the literature. This article is a methodology for these models. Different factors involved in making this variety are discussed. The models are described and it is shown how they are different or related to each other. The models are from the existing literature. However, to complete the methodology some of the models are introduced by the authors. Furthermore, the concept of sequence matrix is introduced which helps to differentiate some models and should be considered when NCS is analysed as a switched linear system. This methodology can be used as a basis for selecting the suitable model in analysis and design of NCSs. Denial of service (DoS) attack and time delay switch (TDS) attack can be considered as packet dropout and packet delay respectively. Thus, this methodology can also be used in analysis and design of NCS under these cyber-physical attacks.

First, the robust controller of the original uncertain system is derived by adding a feedback gain to the optimal controller of the nominal system. It is also shown that this robust controller can achieve optimality under a specified cost function, which serves as the basic idea of the robust optimal control design. Then, a critic network is constructed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the nominal system, where an additional stabilizing term is introduced to verify the stability. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is also proved by using the Lyapunov approach. Moreover, the obtained results are extended to solve decentralized optimal control problem of continuous-time nonlinear interconnected large-scale systems. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the established control scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The upper and lower Frame Error Ratio (FER) performance bounds are derived for aiding our network coding design. The outage capacity of the D-DCMC channel is also calculated and used for computing the best-case performance bounds of both the corresponding single-link scheme and of the proposed NNCNM system. Moreover, a new technique referred to as the Pragmatic Algebraic Linear Equation Method (PALEM) was proposed for determining the exact number of information sources that may be recovered from the composite NNCNM stream, which constitutes a lower-complexity evaluation of the attainable FER performance of the NNCNM systems without resorting to high-complexity Monte-Carlo simulations. The NNCNM systems advocated are capable of operating within 0.3-0.5 dB from the corresponding D-DCMC capacity. A joint treatment of channel and network coding is considered in our system(2). The design principles presented in this contribution may be extended to a vast range of NNCNM based systems using arbitrary channel coding schemes.

Dynamic behavior of DCT and DDT formulations for the Sanger neural network	NEUROCOMPUTING					8th Biennial Meeting of the International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks	JUN 08-10, 2005	Vilanova, SPAIN	Univ Politecn Catalunya, Univ Granada, Univ Malaga, Spanish Minist Educ & Ciencia, City Council Vilanova				In this paper, the behavior of the Sanger hebbian artificial neural networks is analyzed. Hebbian networks are employed to implement principal component analysis (PCA), and several improvements over the original model due to Oja have been developed in the last two decades. Among them, Sanger model is designed to directly provide the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix. The behavior of these models has been traditionally considered on a deterministic continuous-time (DCT) formulation whose validity is justified under some hypotheses on the specific asymptotic behavior of the learning gain. In practical applications, these assumptions cannot be guaranteed. This paper addresses a comparative study with a deterministic discrete-time (DDT) formulation that characterizes the average evolution of the net, preserving the discrete-time form of the original network and gathering a more realistic behavior of the learning gain. The results thoroughly characterize the relationship between the learning gain and the eigenvalue structure of the correlation matrix. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The periodic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is constructed to decide whether the sampling data are delivered to controllers or not. Meanwhile, the controller is updated only when the event-triggered condition deviates from a prescribed threshold. Compared with traditional continuous ETMs, the proposed periodic ETM can guarantee a minimal lower bound of the inter-event intervals and avoid sampling calculation point-to-point, which means that the partial communication resources can be efficiently economized. The critic and actor neural networks (NNs), consisting of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), aim to approximate the unknown long-term performance index function and the ideal event-triggered controller, respectively. A rigorous stability analysis based on the Lyapunov difference method is provided to substantiate that the closed-loop system can be stabilized. All error signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) under the guidance of the proposed control scheme.

The mixed delays comprise both discrete time-varying delay and distributed delay. The stochastic nonlinearities in the form of statistical means cover several well-studied nonlinear functions. And the multiplicative disturbances are in the form of a scalar Gaussian white noise with unit variance. Furthermore, the failures of sensors are quantified by a variable varying in a given interval. A filter is designed to guarantee that the dynamics of the estimation error is asymptotically mean-square stable. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a filter are obtained by using a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and delay-partitioning method. Then a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach for designing such a reliable H-infinity filter is presented.

In this article, we propose a robust delay and energy constrained scheduling algorithm based on the exploitation of the mostly pre-known periodic data generation nature of sensor nodes in control systems. We first formulate the joint optimization of scheduling, power control and rate adaptation for discrete rate transmission model, in which only a finite set of transmission rates are supported, as a Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming problem and prove its NP-hardness. Next, we propose an optimal polynomial-time power control and rate adaptation algorithm for minimizing the transmission time of a node subset. We then design a novel polynomial-time heuristic scheduling algorithm based on first determining the concurrently transmitting node subsets and then distributing them uniformly over time by a modified Karmarkar-Karp algorithm. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheduling algorithm in terms of robustness, delay and runtime on the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN) simulation platform, which we developed in network simulator-3 (ns3).

The B-rep format is widely used in the design, simulation and manufacturing industries to enable sophisticated and precise CAD modeling operations. However, B-rep data presents some unique challenges when used with modern machine learning due to the complexity of the data structure and its support for both continuous non-Euclidean geometric entities and discrete topological entities. In this paper, we propose a unified representation for B-rep data that exploits the U and V parameter domain of curves and surfaces to model geometry, and an adjacency graph to explicitly model topology. This leads to a unique and efficient network architecture, UV-Net, that couples image and graph convolutional neural networks in a compute and memory-efficient manner. To aid in future research we present a synthetic labelled B-rep dataset, SolidLetters, derived from human designed fonts with variations in both geometry and topology. Finally we demonstrate that UV-Net can generalize to supervised and unsupervised tasks on five datasets, while outperforming alternate 3D shape representations such as point clouds, voxels, and meshes.

A new time-dependent Lyapunov functional is proposed for the synchronization error systems. The advantage of the constructed Lyapunov functional lies in the fact that it is positive definite at sampling times but not necessarily between sampling times, and makes full use of the available information about the actual sampling pattern. A local stability condition of the synchronization error systems is derived, based on which a sampled-data controller with respect to the actuator saturation is designed to ensure that the master neural networks and slave neural networks are locally asymptotically synchronous.

The design of DL algorithms is time-consuming process that requires expert-level knowledge. To overcome this problem, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is proposed, which automatically searches for the best neural network architecture for a given task. Indeed, evolutionary NAS has emerged as a widely studied research area, in which evolutionary algorithms are used to design neural networks. In this study, we proposed a novel encoding scheme to represent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures using continuous representation, which provides a larger search space and potentially finds better solutions compared to discrete representations. Moreover, it allows better exploitation of genetic operators, leading to a quick convergence of individuals. Furthermore, in order to reduce the computational time of the evaluation phase during the search process, surrogate models are used to provide an alternative objective function. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposal, experiments are performed on CIFAR-10 and multiple datasets from the MedMNIST benchmark. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to several existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

J	You, CS; Zheng, BX; Zhang, R				You, Changsheng; Zheng, Beixiong; Zhang, Rui			Channel Estimation and Passive Beamforming for Intelligent Reflecting Surface: Discrete Phase Shift and Progressive Refinement	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS												Prior studies on intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) have mostly assumed perfect channel state information (CSI) available for designing the IRS passive beamforming as well as the continuously adjustable phase shift at each of its reflecting elements, which, however, have simplified two challenging issues for implementing IRS in practice, namely, its channel estimation and passive beamforming designs both under the constraint of discrete phase shifts. To address them, we consider in this paper an IRS-aided single-user communication system and design the IRS training reflection matrix for channel estimation as well as the passive beamforming for data transmission, both subject to the new constraint of discrete phase shifts. We show that the training reflection matrix design with discrete phase shifts greatly differs from that with continuous phase shifts, and the corresponding passive beamforming design should take into account the correlated IRS channel estimation errors due to discrete phase shifts. Moreover, a novel hierarchical training reflection design is proposed to progressively estimate IRS elements' channels over multiple time blocks by exploiting the IRS-elements grouping and partition. Based on the resolved IRS channels in each block, we further design the progressive passive beamforming at the IRS with discrete phase shifts to improve the achievable rate for data transmission over the blocks. Extensive numerical results are presented, which demonstrate the significant performance improvement of proposed channel estimation and passive beamforming designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.

The information transmission among the systems can be directed and lagged, that is, the coupling matrices are not needed to be symmetrical and there exist interconnection delays. The dynamical behaviors of the networks can be both continuous and discrete. Specially, the timevarying delays are taken into consideration to describe the impulsive effects of the system. The control objective is that the trajectories of the salve system by designing suitable control schemes track the trajectories of the master system with impulsive effects. Consequently, sufficient criteria for guaranteeing the mean square exponential convergence of the two systems are obtained in view of Lyapunov stability theory, comparison principle, and mathematical induction. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented to show the verification of the main results in this article. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Chandrasekhar, A; Sridhara, S; Suresh, K				Chandrasekhar, Aaditya; Sridhara, Saketh; Suresh, Krishnan			Integrating material selection with design optimization via neural networks	ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS												The engineering design process often entails optimizing the underlying geometry while simultaneously selecting a suitable material. For a certain class of simple problems, the two are separable where, for example, one can first select an optimal material, and then optimize the geometry. However, in general, the two are not separable. Furthermore, the discrete nature of material selection is not compatible with gradient-based geometry optimization, making simultaneous optimization challenging. In this paper, we propose the use of variational autoencoders (VAE) for simultaneous optimization. First, a data-driven VAE is used to project the discrete material database onto a continuous and differentiable latent space. This is then coupled with a fully-connected neural network, embedded with a finite-element solver, to simultaneously optimize the material and geometry. The neural-network's built-in gradient optimizer and back-propagation are exploited during optimization. The proposed framework is demonstrated using trusses, where an optimal material needs to be chosen from a database, while simultaneously optimizing the cross-sectional areas of the truss members. Several numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The Python code used in these experiments is available at github.com/UVV-ERSL/MaTruss. [GRAPHICS] .

We propose a two-layer discretetime iterative cooperative (TDIC) framework for multiple dc MGs, in which a two-layer iterative voltage estimator is designed. Based on this, the TDIC strategy allows all slave-DGs' current outputs and estimated voltage to track that of their respective master-DGs, which are then guided to achieve consensus current output ratio and reference voltage synchronization. As long as the sampling period of the lower-cyber layer is less than that of the upper-cyber layer, all DGs' weighted average voltages can be regulated to the reference voltage, meanwhile the accurate current sharing can be realized within each MG and among multiple MGs. Compared with most continuous communication approaches, the designed control inputs, supported by intermittent communication across sparse two-layer cyber networks, are merely updated at the end of each round of discretetime iteration, which can significantly reduce the communication pressure as well as ensure a faster convergence speed.																			1553-572X		978-1-7281-5414-5				2020							3383	3388		10.1109/iecon43393.2020.9255379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iecon43393.2020.9255379													WOS:000637323703063

Existing methods, no matter based on reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms (EA), conduct architecture search in a discrete space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method to automatic neural architecture design based on continuous optimization. We call this new approach neural architecture optimization (NAO). There are three key components in our proposed approach: (1) An encoder embeds/maps neural network architectures into a continuous space. (2) A predictor takes the continuous representation of a network as input and predicts its accuracy. (3) A decoder maps a continuous representation of a network back to its architecture. The performance predictor and the encoder enable us to perform gradient based optimization in the continuous space to find the embedding of a new architecture with potentially better accuracy. Such a better embedding is then decoded to a network by the decoder. Experiments show that the architecture discovered by our method is very competitive for image classification task on CIFAR-10 and language modeling task on PTB, outperforming or on par with the best results of previous architecture search methods with a significantly reduction of computational resources. Specifically we obtain 2.11% test set error rate for CIFAR-10 image classification task and 56.0 test set perplexity of PTB language modeling task. The best discovered architectures on both tasks are successfully transferred to other tasks such as CIFAR-100 and WildText-2. Furthermore, combined with the recent proposed weight sharing mechanism, we discover powerful architecture on CIFAR-10 (with error rate 3.53%) and on PTB (with test set perplexity 56.6), with very limited computational resources (less than 10 GPU hours) for both tasks.

The ability of neural systems to provide nonlinear mappings between process features and desired outputs has been the major driving force behind implementations. One of the major issues limiting the widespread industrial uptake of neural systems is the lack of detailed understanding of their design, implementation and operation. In many cases, network topologies and training parameters are systematically varied until satisfactory convergence is achieved. There is little discussion of the rationale behind the adopted training methods. A review of research into the functions that can be readily represented by neural networks are presented in this paper. The application focus is the control and monitoring of a discrete manufacturing process that is part of the manufacturing cycle of mixed technology surface mount printed circuit boards. Detailed knowledge of the process operation and functionality that can be represented by simple network topologies have been combined to develop a structured, partially interconnected neural network that provides optimised convergence performance. A comparison of the designed solution with standard approaches to neural network implementation is given. It has been demonstrated that if there is sufficient confidence in the operation of the process, input feature interaction within the network can be constrained to produce a robust control and monitoring system.

The NCS has created a paradigm shift in control system technology. An NCS consists of control loops joined through communication networks in which both the control signal and the feedback signal are exchanged between the system and the controller. However, its materialization faces several challenges as it requires the integration of advanced control and communication techniques. This paper presents an extensive review of NCSs from the perspective of control system design. The evolution of NCSs is broadly divided in three phases, namely NCSs prior to 2000, NCSs during 2001-2010, and NCSs from 2011 onwards. This division corresponds to the initial status, intermediate status, and the recent status of the developments in the design of NCSs. The advancement of different control techniques during these phases has been discussed comprehensively. This paper also describes the transition of control systems form continuous domain to networked domain, which makes it better than the traditional control systems. Some important practical applications, which have been implemented using NCSs, have also been discussed. The thrust areas for future research on NCS have also been identified.

Process Structure Optimization Using a Hybrid Disjunctive-Genetic Programming Approach	10TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING	Computer Aided Chemical Engineering				10th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering	AUG 16-20, 2009	Salvador, BRAZIL					Discrete optimization problems, which give rise to the conditional modelling of equations through representations as logic based disjunctions, are very important and often appear in all scales of chemical engineering process network design and synthesis. Disjunctive-Genetic Programming (D-GP), based on the integration of Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the disjunctive formulations of the Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) for the optimization of process networks, has been proposed in this work. With the increase in the problem scale, dealing with such alternating routes becomes difficult due to increased computational load and possible entanglement of the results in sub-optimal solutions due to infeasibilities in the MILP space. In this work, the genetic algorithm (GA) has been used as a jumping operator to the different terms of the discrete search space and for the generation of different feasible fixed configurations. This proposed approach eliminates the need for the reformulation of the discrete/discontinuous optimization problems into direct MINLP problems, thus allowing for the solution of the original problem as a continuous optimization problem but only at each individual discrete and reduced search space.

This paper presents a review on the discrete-time teleoperation systems, including issues such as stability, passivity and time delays. Using discrete-time methods for a master-slave teleoperation system can simplify control implementation. Varieties of control schemes have been proposed for these systems and major concerns such as passivity, stability and transparency have been studied. Recently, unreliable communication networks affected by packet loss and variable transmission delays have been receivedmuch attention. Thus, it is worth considering discrete-time theories for bilateral teleoperation architectures, which are formulated on the same lines as the continuous-time systems. Despite the extensive amount of researches concerning continuous-time teleoperation systems, only a few papers have been published on the analysis and controller design for discrete bilateral forms. This paper takes into account the challenges for the discrete structure of bilateral teleoperation systems and notifies the recent contributions in this area. The effect of sampling time on the stability-transparency trade-off and the task performance is taken into consideration in this review. These studies can help to design guidelines to have better transparency and stable teleoperation systems.

Approximating electrical distribution networks via mixed-integer nonlinear programming	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS												Given urban data derived from a geographical information system (GIS), we consider the problem of constructing an estimate of the electrical distribution system of an urban area. We employ the image data to obtain an approximate electrical load distribution over a network of a prespecificed discretization. Together with partial information about existing substations, we determine the optimal placement of electrical substations to sustain such a load that minimizes the cost of capital and losses. This requires solving large-scale quadratic programs with discrete variables for which we present a novel penalization-smoothing scheme. The choice of locations allows one to determine the optimal flows in this network, as required by physical requirements which provide us with an approximation of the distribution network. Furthermore, the scheme allows for approximating systems in the presence of no-go areas, such as lakes and fields. We examine the performance of our algorithm on the solution of a set of location problems and observe that the scheme is capable of solving large-scale instances, well beyond the realm of existing mixed-integer nonlinear programming solvers. We conclude with a case study in which a stage-wise extension of this scheme is developed to reflect the temporal evolution of load. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hoogendoorn, SP; Bovy, PHL				Hoogendoorn, SP; Bovy, PHL			Dynamic user-optimal assignment in continuous time and space	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												To support planning, design, and management of pedestrian infrastructure, dynamic assignment models are useful tools. However, current models are network-based and presume that travelers can choose between a finite number of discrete route alternatives. For walking facilities, where pedestrians can choose their paths freely in two-dimensional space, applicability of these traditional network models is limited. This article puts forward an approach for user-optimal dynamic assignment in continuous time and space. Contrary to network-based approaches, the theory allows the traffic units to choose from an infinite non-countable set of paths through the considered space. The approach consists of three interrelated steps, that is: determining the continuous paths using a path choice model, assigning the origin-destination flows, and calculating the resulting traffic conditions. The approach to determine a user-optimal assignment is heuristic and consists of a sequence of all-or-nothing assignments in continuous time-space. The article presents the mathematical problem formulation, solution approaches, and application examples. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To improve their safety and reliability, non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are implemented to achieve efficient damage detection. In this paper, a novel stress-strain-based damage detection approach is proposed for composite structures by using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and selective kernel convolutional network (SKNet), which exhibit good robustness when dealing with the stress-strain signals collected from different positions of composite structures. First, a stress-strain-based measuring scheme is designed for vibration response monitoring of the composite structures. Second, the collected stress-strain signals are converted into two-dimensional time-frequency images by the CWT. Then, the SKNet is constructed to classify these images for damage detection. Finally, an experimental test is conducted on a composite capsule, data from which is employed to evaluate the proposed method. The comparison results of our proposed method and other state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate its superiority.

As opposed to the traditional qualitative conflict detection methodology, the proposed method gives a valid model to describe the multidisciplinary coupling relationship and analyze parameter uncertainties so as to predict the potential conflicts in parameter design. An iterative algorithm based on interval Newton factor is design to refine the intervals, which can deal with not only continuous parameters but discrete ones. The model uses the algorithm to verify the parameter design process to assist the designers in determining design variables to reduce the multidisciplinary iterations and predict conflicts. A method is also proposed to deal with differential equations in the model which describes dynamic relationship of design variables and specifications. An engineering project of the semi-active bogie design shows the validity of the method.																					7-5062-7841-3				2005							820	826																WOS:000234109200180
J	Li, ZK; Chen, J				Li, Zhongkui; Chen, Jie			Robust Consensus of Linear Feedback Protocols Over Uncertain Network Graphs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												In this paper, we study the robust consensus problem for a group of linear discrete-time or continuous-time agents to coordinate over an uncertain communication network, which is to achieve consensus against transmission errors and noises. We model the network by communication links subject to deterministic uncertainties, which can be additive perturbations described by either some unknown transfer functions or norm bounded matrices. We show that the robust consensus problem can generally be solved by solving a simultaneous H-infinity control problem for a set of low-dimensional subsystems. We also derive necessary conditions for the existence of a protocol achieving robust consensus. The results show that for discrete-time agents the uncertainty size must not exceed the inverse of the Mahler measure of the agents, while for continuous-time agents it must be less than the unity. Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are further presented to design the robust consensus protocols.																			0018-9286	1558-2523				AUG	2017	62	8					4251	4258		10.1109/TAC.2017.2685082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2017.2685082													WOS:000406395900059

The CDSs are more general systems with possible multiple vector fields and dynamics. The ETIC scheme is based on three key indices: threshold value, control-free index, and check period, and it is executed by designing three levels of events from which ETIC is triggered. Both ETIC and ETIC with time-delays (delayed ETIC) are studied, respectively, and the criteria for ISS are derived for CDSs under ETIC. Thus the stabilisation to ISS is achieved for CDSs by the designed ETIC with or without time delays. The data dropout of ETIC is also investigated, where the maximal allowable dropout rates are estimated, respectively. It shows that the proposed ETIC scheme has advantages over the reported event-triggered control and has robustness with respect to the network-induced time-delays although larger time-delays might lead to a slower convergence speed for the stabilisation to ISS. Finally, two examples with numerical simulations are given to illustrate the obtained results.

J	Zhou, YT; Wu, ZG; Yang, C				Zhou, Yitao; Wu, Zhigang; Yang, Chao			Intelligent feedforward gust alleviation based on neural network	CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS												This paper proposes a neural network-based intelligent feedforward gust alleviation framework, which includes a neural network identification model and a neural network controller. A neural network training dataset is formed by collecting flight data and the gust data encountered during the aircraft flight. A neural network identification model is first trained to accurately predict the aircraft's output. Then, based on the output of the identification model and the collected flight data, the parameters of the time-delay neural network controller are obtained through a learning process. The simulation results show that the designed intelligent controller has good gust alleviation effects for both continuous turbulence excitation and discrete gust excitation. For example, when the aircraft is 40000 kg and the flight speed is 0.81Ma, the controller achieves a 67.82% reduction in wingtip acceleration and a 35.90% reduction in center of mass acceleration under continuous turbulence excitation. When considering the measurement uncertainties, such as noise existing in the collected data, the trained controller can still achieve an acceptable gust alleviation effect. Finally, considering a flight in which the aircraft mass is constantly changing, the intelligent controller, which continuously learns from new flight data, maintains a good gust alleviation effect throughout the flight.

The considered reactors can be viewed as a class of MIMO systems with unknown functions and interconnections as well as the output constraints. These properties of the reactors will lead to a completed task for designing a stable control algorithm. To this end, several unknown functions are approximated based on the neural approximation, a novel recursive design method is used to remove the interconnection term, and Barrier Lyapunov function is introduced to avoid the violation of the output constraints. The stability of the proposed scheme is proved based on the Lyapunov analysis method. A simulation example for continuous stirred tank reactor is illustrated to verify the validity of the algorithm.

First, the concept of the Filippov solution is extended to functional differential equations with discontinuous right-hand sides via functional differential inclusions. Then, by constructing suitable Lyapunov-krasovskii functionals and employing some useful inequality techniques, several novel conditions ensuring the GDS of considered BAM neural networks are obtained through designing two different types of nonlinear controllers. The results we proposed in this paper are general since GDS have generalized the traditional asymptotical synchronization, exponential synchronization, polynomial synchronization and contained them as its special cases.

In the proposed algorithm, a continuous-discrete time observer is designed for the continuous estimation of both position and velocity from the discrete position information of the neighbors. These estimated states are then used for designing a continuous control law which solves the leader-following consensus problem. Moreover, the dynamics of the leader is not fixed and can be controlled through an external input. The stability analysis has been carried out by employing the Lyapunov approach which provides sufficient conditions to tune the parameters according to the maximum allowable sampling period. The developed algorithm has been simulated and then tested on an actual multi-robot system consisting of three differential drive wheeled robots. Both simulation and hardware results validate the effectiveness of the control algorithm. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective is to minimize the cost of superstructure particularly arches and hangers of network arch bridge by optimizing the geometric shape, rise to span ratio, cross section of arch, and the number, arrangement and cross sectional dimensions of hangers. Constraints for design are formulated as per AASHTO, AISC and ACI Specifications. The minimum cost design problem is characterized by having a combination of continuous, discrete, and integer sets of design variables and is subjected to highly nonlinear, implicit and discontinuous constraints. An optimization algorithm, evolutionary operation (EVOP), is used that is capable of locating directly with high probability the global minimum without requiring information on gradient or sub-gradient of the objective function. EVOP is interfaced with finite element analysis software, ANSYS for evaluation of structural response of the bridge to verify the constraints and also to evaluate objective function. Within the range of design constant parameters considered, it is observed that 38% to 40% of total cost can be saved for circular and parabolic arches respectively, if design is optimized. Results also show that parabolic arch with optimum design variables is more economic than the optimized arch bridges with circular arch geometry.

The proposed design strategy is implemented sequentially in three stages. First, an integer program (IF) is formulated for producing the optimal structure of state-task network (STN). A nonlinear program (NLP) is then developed to generate the corresponding material-balance constraints. In the final step, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model are constructed for stipulating the optimal short-term and cyclic schedules respectively. The conventional concept of event points is adopted to facilitate the continuous-time representation in these model formulations. The implementation procedure is illustrated with two example systems in this paper. Satisfactory process configurations and production schedules can both be produced in all the cases we have studied so far.

Design of Distributed Controllers and Communication Topologies Considering Link Failures	2013 EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)					European Control Conference (ECC)	JUL 17-19, 2013	ETH Zurich, Zurich, SWITZERLAND	European Control Assoc, IFAC, IEEE, CSS	ETH Zurich			This paper presents results on optimization based design of distributed control laws for linear discrete-time systems interconnected through states, inputs, and a cost function. In the proposed scheme the subsystems may communicate state information, resulting in a trade-off between good closed-loop performance and high communication costs as well as robustness issues if communication links are unreliable. Previous results on optimization based synthesis of a communication topology and associated distributed control laws are extended to the case that (i) some communication links are prone to failure and that (ii) a controller may reconfigure itself, if it is directly affected by a link failure. To include this scenario into the synthesis problem, a link failure is modeled as a change in the network topology and of the affected controllers. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer semi-definite problem (MISDP) which combines the discrete optimization of the network topology subject to communication constraints and link failures with subproblems for structured controller synthesis.																					978-3-033-03962-9				2013							3294	3300																WOS:000332509703114

It is more challenging and complex than region demand prediction since it needs to predict traffic demand for each pair of regions rather than a single region, which means $N<^>2$ time series need to be predicted given $N$ stations. Most existing works are mainly proposed for the region (or station) demand prediction. On the other hand, previous Origin-Destination demand prediction methods only follow a single discrete-time setting while the input data are continuous-time OD orders, which means these methods have not sufficiently leveraged the rich information for demand prediction. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel framework consisting of both continuous-time and discrete-time representation learning modules for Origin-Destination demand prediction. Firstly, we construct memorable representations of all nodes and design a continuous-time learning module to update the nodes' representations once a time-stamped OD transaction is observed. Then, a discrete-time representation learning module is proposed to generate discrete-time messages containing information across a fixed time interval from a macro perspective. Next, a co-updater module is designed to fuse messages from both continuous-time and discrete-time channels into node memory. Last, a graph attention module is developed, which generates final node embeddings using updated node memory and predicts the forthcoming OD demand matrix based on them. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method leads to significant and consistent improvements compared to other methods.

These studies include the development of a software tool for decision support, based on the application of fuzzy logic techniques, which can indicate water quality episodes from the behavior of variables measured at continuous automatic water control networks. Using a few physical-chemical variables recorded continuously, the expert system is able to obtain water quality phenomena indicators, which can be associated, with a high probability of cause effect relationship, with human pressure on the water environment, such as urban discharges or diffuse agricultural pollution. In this sense, at the proposed expert system, automatic water quality control networks complement manual sampling of official administrative networks and laboratory analysis, providing information related to specific events (discharges) or continuous processes (eutrophication, fish risk) which can hardly be detected by discrete sampling.

This particular procedure will transform continuous variables into discrete ones, when dealing with continuous inputs with probabilistic and uncertain nature. Based on the FBN, the fuzzy reasoning model for prediction and diagnosis can be designed. To validate our method, two models are built and used to classify the astrocytoma malignant degree, which can be modeled by probability quantitatively. The experiment results show that the model fusing both low-level image features and high-level semantics outperforms the one only using low-level image features with very promising results. This FBN model also provides knowledge expression in predicting astrocytoma malignant level. This study provides a novel objective method to quantitatively assess the astrocytoma malignancy level that can be used to assist doctors to diagnose the tumor.																					1-4244-0060-0				2006							3207	+																WOS:000241452304107

The main purpose of the addressed issue is to propose a state estimator design algorithm that ensures the error dynamics of the state estimation to be stochastically stable with a prespecified H-infinity disturbance attenuation index. We put forward certain switching functions to account for the discrete-time yet state-dependent characteristics of the memristive connection weights. By resorting to the robust analysis theory and the Lyapunov-functional analysis theory, we derive some sufficient conditions to guarantee the desired estimation performance. The derived sufficient conditions rely not only on the size of discrete time-delays and the probability distribution law of the distributed time-delays but also on the statistics information of the coefficients of the adopted Rice fading model. Based on the established existence conditions, the gain matrices of the desired estimator are obtained by means of the feasibility of a set of matrix inequalities that can be checked efficiently via available software packages.

When discrete decisions are involved in the follower's problem, the resulting lower-level mixed-integer program prohibits direct transformation of the bilevel program into a single-level mathematical program using the MKT conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a mixed-integer bilevel programming (MIBP) modeling framework and solution algorithm for optimal supply chain design and operations, where the follower is allowed to have discrete decisions, e.g. facility location, technology selection, and opening/shutting-down of production lines. A reformulation-and-decomposition algorithm is developed for global optimization of the MIBP problems. A case study on an integrated forestry and biofuel supply chain is presented to demonstrate the application, along with comparisons to conventional centralized modeling and optimization methods.

In this article, we develop a centralized cross-layer protocol that mitigates network interference and maximizes concurrent transmissions to reduce end-to-end delay. Instead of optimizing individual layers separately, we blend the traditional layered architecture and combine the physical layer, medium access control (MAC) layer, and network layer functions together. Specifically, we optimize the power control in the physical layer, link scheduling in the MAC layer, and routing in the network layer jointly to achieve a global optimization of end-to-end delay. First, the joint design problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is an NP-hard problem and hard to solve mathematically. Then, we propose a bio-inspired-algorithm-based solution, namely, the discrete improved artificial bee colony (DIABC) algorithm, aiming at finding an approximate optimal cross-layer scheduling scheme. To further reduce end-to-end delay, we optimize the uplink frame structure and routing metric in the centralized cross-layer framework. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves network performance improvement in terms of end-to-end delay, service rate, and energy consumption.

The model is based on a standard table to find similar entities in the physical model for consistency checking. The standard table entities and physical model entities contain both continuous attributes and discrete attributes. How to accurately calculate the similarity of these different attributes and fuse them into a unique similarity, which can be used to efficiently and accurately mine the entity pairs with the highest similarity, are problems to be solved. In order to solve the above problems and make this similarity calculation and fusion method scalable, this paper calculates the syntactic similarity of continuous attributes, semantic similarity, and discrete attribute similarity to the content of different attributes in the entity and introduces a NAS (Neural Architecture Search) based on these similarities Similarity Fusion Neural Network automatically designed a method to achieve the fusion of similarity, which will be called SFNAS (Similarity Fusion NAS). The neural network fusion similarity calculated using SFNAS is better than the traditional linear weighted average similarity in terms of entity pair matching hit rate. This paper can provide useful references for subsequent research on SG-CIM models.

We consider decision trees, bayesian network, neural network and support vector approaches The Modified Bayesian Network (MBN), as designed by us offers significant advantages over other approaches. The application of bayesian network has generally been restricted to domains having discrete variable values (such as binary), or to the domain with continuous variable values which approximate to Gaussian distribution. However, MBN can form sound representation of non-Gaussian Multimodal continuous distribution, as is the case with feature space in multimedia indexing. This can be accomplished by intelligent partitioning and data clique association. The structure of MBN and its functionality on real video is also presented in the paper. MBN can perform optimal classification even with partially specified queries given by the user. The strategy automatically gives more weightage to the relevant features amongst hundreds of features present in multimedia indexing system. The inference mechanism is based on iteratively comparing the posterior probability of one class with all other classes. In the comparison of one class with another class, each feature takes different importance measure corresponding to the discerning capacity of the feature. A label is assigned to the multimedia data corresponding to the winning class. The comparison with other classification tools shows that MBN classification performance is consistently better than that of the other tools.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	0-8194-3993-2				2001	4315						107	117		10.1117/12.410919	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.410919													WOS:000168020500011

This is a very complex mixed binary nonlinear programming problem. A constructive heuristic algorithm (CHA) aimed at obtaining an excellent quality solution for this problem is presented. In each step of the CHA, a sensitivity index is used to add a circuit or a substation to the distribution network. This sensitivity index is obtained solving the DNP problem considering the numbers of circuits and substations to be added as continuous variables (relaxed problem). The relaxed problem is a large and complex nonlinear programming and was solved through an efficient nonlinear optimization solver. A local improvement phase and a branching technique were implemented in the CHA. Results of two tests using a distribution network are presented in the paper in order to show the ability of the proposed algorithm.

Firstly, based on both the continuous-time state information of each agent and the discrete-time communication information with time-varying sampling interval of its neighboring agents, a hybrid discrete/continuous consensus protocol is designed. Secondly, hybrid consensus problems are transformed into simultaneous stabilization problems of multiple sampled control subsystems with low dimensions by the state space decomposition approach. Thirdly, by using the time delay approach and linear matrix inequality (LMI) theory, sufficient conditions for hybrid consensus and consensualization are presented, where four LMI constraints are only included. It should be pointed out that the hybrid consensus for high-order swarm systems depends on the gain matrices, the spectra property of the Laplacian matrix, and the maximum sampling interval. Moreover, the consensus function is determined when swarm systems achieve hybrid consensus. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.																					978-1-4799-2538-4				2014							375	380																WOS:000393427700055

Not only discrete but also continuous-time Markov chains are allowed to be computed. By employing chemical reaction networks as a programmable language, molecular concentrations serve to denote both input and output values. One reaction network is elaborately designed for each chain. The evolution of species' concentrations over time well matches the transient solutions of the target continuous-time Markov chain, while equilibrium concentrations can indicate the steady state probabilities. Additionally, second-order Markov chains are considered for implementation, with bimolecular reactions rather than unary ones. An original scheme is put forward to compile unimolecular systems to DNA strand displacement reactions for the sake of future physical implementations. Deterministic, stochastic and DNA simulations are provided to enhance correctness, validity and feasibility.

The objective of this study is to investigate and reconstruct the hydraulic properties and the geometry of the induced fracture network to improve the insights and validate the conceptual model of the induced fracture network due to the stress redistribution during tunnel excavations. Within the presented study, the cross-hole responses of the pneumatic tests were analyzed in the first step with an equivalent porous media-3D travel time-based tomographic approach. In the next step selected 2D profiles of the 3D model domain were inverted using a discrete fracture network inversion approach. The database of the tomographic analysis is based on 18 gas injection tests and 151 pressure interferences, which were recorded between nine closely spaced boreholes. The travel time-based inversion approach allowed for the reconstruction of the 3D gas diffusivity distribution between nine boreholes with high-resolution. The applied discrete fracture network inversion approach is based on a transdimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology and it operates with reversible model updates (jumps) that change the problem dimensions, that is, the number, length and position of fractures within the model domain after each iteration step. The synthesis of the results between the reconstructed 3D diffusivity tomogram and the 2D fracture tomograms improved the insights into the spatial geometry of the induced fracture network around galleries.

This paper proposed an improved dynamic kernel clustering algorithm for mixed numeric and categorical network communication data. First, centroid prototype based on the mean and distribution centroid was put forward to represent the cluster center. Then by using Gaussian kernel function, the paper introduced a new dissimilarity measure between the data object and the centroid prototype in combination with the significance of different categorical values. On this basis, the objective function was defined, which took into account both the compact degree in a cluster and the discrete degree among the clusters. After that an improved kernel clustering algorithm was designed. In the process of clustering, centroid prototype and the value of the clustering parameter dynamically updated for a better description of the characteristics of clusters' change. Finally, in order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm, the paper further applied it to network forensics, and the experimental results showed that the method could mine the intrusion behavior more accurately.																			1738-9976	2207-9629				JAN	2016	10	1					343	354		10.14257/ijsia.2016.10.1.31	http://dx.doi.org/10.14257/ijsia.2016.10.1.31													WOS:000376639500031

Both the process noise and the measurement noise are unknown but bounded. The nonlinear function is assumed to satisfy the sector bounded condition and the incomplete measurement is model by a diagonal matrix. The main purpose of this paper is to design a set-membership filtering method in order to provide the certain regions, which include the real states. Accordingly, the filtering errors at each time can be limited to the ellipsoid sets for the considered nonlinear delayed complex networks in the simultaneous presence of unknown but bounded noise, mixed time-delays and incomplete measurements. Moreover, a convex optimization method is presented to obtain the minimum ellipsoid domain. In addition, the filter gain matrix can be obtained by solving a series of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed set-membership filtering method.																				2164-2583				JAN 1	2020	8	1					265	276		10.1080/21642583.2020.1746210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21642583.2020.1746210													WOS:000522350700001

This paper presents a novel method for Bayesian network structure learning using a discrete Harris hawks optimization algorithm, named BNC-HHO. It uses the max-min parents and children algorithm, V-structure & log-likelihood function, and neighborhood structures to limit the search space during the initialization phase. Then, the Harris hawk optimization algorithm is extended from the continuous to the discrete domain by redefining the movement strategies of hawks using genetic operators in genetic algorithm. The crossover and mutation operations in the proposed method are controlled by an adaptive crossover and mutation rate based on the X-conditional cloud. To balance the exploration and exploitation phases, a nonlinear escaping energy curve is also designed. Finally, the quality of the solution is further improved using a local optimizer. Experiments on various standard networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can quickly get higher structure scores and better convergence accuracy in most cases compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. It indicates that the proposed algorithm can be used as an effective and feasible method for learning Bayesian network structures.

Most existing countermeasures either require specialized hardware devices or make strong assumptions on the network in order to capture the specific (partial) symptom induced by wormholes. Those requirements and assumptions limit the applicability of previous approaches. In this work, we present our attempt to understand the impact and inevitable symptom of wormholes and develop distributed detection methods by making as few restrictions and assumptions as possible. We fundamentally analyze the wormhole problem using a topology methodology, and propose an effective distributed approach, which relies solely on network connectivity information, without any requirements on special hardware devices or any rigorous assumptions on network properties. We rigorously prove the correctness of this design in continuous geometric domains and extend it into discrete domains. We evaluate its performance through extensive simulations.

A hybrid system has both continuous variables and discrete events. A NHS consists of a set of subsystems that are coupled together. Both continuous dynamics and coupling among subsystems change as events occur. When an event occurs stochastically, the continuous state variables may jump from one value to another. Using the stochastic Lyapunov functional approach, sufficient conditions on the existence of an H-infinity state-feedback controller that ensures stochastic stability and H-infinity disturbance attenuation for NHS with and without time delays are obtained. The derived conditions are expressed in terms of solutions of appropriate algebraic inequalities. A new approach to the design of such a controller is then presented. An illustrative example of a unified chaotic network with randomly jumping parameters is used to demonstrate the satisfactory control performance.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				OCT	2011	5	15					1698	1708		10.1049/iet-cta.2010.0499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2010.0499													WOS:000295623200003

Stochastic biochemical reaction networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for realistic mathematical models of cellular phenomena. While classical control algorithm like PI and PID controllers have been recently proposed as controllers in living cells, methods for designing more advanced optimal controllers remain elusive. Here we formulate the H-infinity control problem for linear stochastic reaction networks and provide an approach for its solution using Dynamic Programming-one that gives rise to a nonstandard Riccati differential equation. We next address the H-infinity sampled-data control problem for stochastic networks, and present a solution based on Hybrid Dynamic Programming that requires the solution of coupled Riccati differential and difference equations.																			0743-1546	2576-2370	978-1-6654-6761-2				2022							1924	1929		10.1109/CDC51059.2022.9992946	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC51059.2022.9992946													WOS:000948128101101

To cope with the effect caused by inertial (second-order) term, most of the previous literature use the variable translation to reduce the order. Different from that, by directly designing a Lyapunov functional and feedback controller, a novel non-reduced order method is proposed in this paper to solve the finite-time (fixed-time) stabilization problem of inertial memristive Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Two kinds of time delays are considered in our network model, novel criteria are then derived for both cases.

Our model has a local learning rule, such that the synaptic weight updates depend only on the information directly accessible by the synapse. By exploiting asymmetry in the connections between binary neurons, we show that MPN can be trained to robustly memorize multiple spatiotemporal patterns of binary vectors, generalizing the ability of the symmetric Hopfield network to memorize static spatial patterns. In addition, we demonstrate that the model can efficiently learn sequences of binary pictures as well as generative models for experimental neural spike-train data. Our learning rule is consistent with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), thus providing a theoretical ground for the systematic design of biologically inspired networks with large and robust long-range sequence storage capacity.					wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; Liu, Zuozhu/IUN-8338-2023; Chotibut, Thiparat/GSD-3973-2022; Yan, Jun/IXD-7801-2023; Chotibut, Thiparat/AAG-9699-2020	Chotibut, Thiparat/0000-0002-8936-1413													2159-5399	2374-3468	978-1-57735-835-0				2020	34						1316	1323																WOS:000667722801048

It is shown that the consensus seeking process can be viewed as an iterative learning process for agents under directed networks to improve their performances from time to time in order to achieve consensus. If a desired consensus state is specified, then the multi-agent system can be guaranteed to reach consensus through reducing the tracking error between each agent's state and the desired consensus state monotonically to zero with respect to the increasing of time. If there is no desired consensus state, then the agents can achieve consensus through reducing their states monotonically to the minimum quantity with increasing time.

Recent observations in multiple cancers have unraveled the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in driving metastasis and therapy recalcitrance. However, the origins of such phenotypic heterogeneity are poorly understood in most cancers. Here, we investigate a regulatory network underlying phenotypic heterogeneity in small cell lung cancer, a devastating disease with no molecular targeted therapy. Discrete and continuous dynamical simulations of this network reveal its multistable behavior that can explain coexistence of four experimentally observed phenotypes. Analysis of the network topology uncovers that multistability emerges from two teams of players that mutually inhibit each other, but members of a team activate one another, forming a 'toggle switch' between the two teams. Deciphering these topological signatures in cancer-related regulatory networks can unravel their 'latent' design principles and offer a rational approach to characterize phenotypic heterogeneity in a tumor.

Motivated by this, we propose a novel Q-learning-based decision making scheme in sensor networks to support the environment adaptive reconfiguration decision. In this scheme, we introduce the rule-based reasoning to predict the trend of environmental change and make reconfiguration decision adaptively. In particular, we apply a real-time reinforcement learning algorithm, called Q-learning, to evaluate the certainty value of the rules in this decision mechanism. Moreover, we map the continuous state space of environment condition into a discrete and finite state space to design a certainty function. The simulation results show that the Q-learning-based decision mechanism can not only learn the change of environment, but also effectively make the reconfiguration decision in sensor networks.																					978-1-4244-0962-4				2007							1122	+																WOS:000250405600199

The sampling errors and transmission delays are described by an independent and identically distributed sequence of continuous random variables and the transmission delays are assumed to be smaller than the noisy sampling intervals. First, a closed-loop discrete-time stochastic framework for networked system that allows investigating noisy sampling intervals, random transmission delays, and packet dropouts simultaneously is established. To render the discrete-time stochastic system suitable for stability analysis and synthesis, an equivalent yet tractable stochastic augmented model is then reformulated with the help of matrix exponential computation. Based on this augmented model, a stability condition involving the expectation of a nonlinear and random coupling matrix is derived. By recurring to the law of total expectation and Kronecker product operation, the expectation operation of the coupling matrix subject to high nonlinearity and multiple randomness is decoupled. Subsequently, a controller algorithm is designed such that the exponential mean-square stability of the original discrete-time stochastic system with a prescribed $H_\infty$ performance is guaranteed. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the controller design algorithm.

Most existing work in the related literature focuses on improving these two parameters, assuming generally unicast communications, which are neither realistic nor efficient given the wireless nature of these networks. Instead, broadcast communications allow a greater instantaneous exchange of information between the network nodes, accelerating the consensus and saving energy in communications. In this work, we propose two methods that optimize the network topology to simultaneously improve the total power consumption per iteration, the maximum power consumption per node and the convergence time in a broadcast scenario. The first method is applied to continuous systems, while the second one is more suitable for discrete systems. Numerical results are presented to show the validity and efficiency of the proposed methods.

To reduce yield loss during the manufacturing process, tool abnormalities should be detected as early as possible during process monitoring. In this paper, we propose a novel fault prognostic method based on Bayesian networks. The network is designed such that it can process both discrete and continuous variables, to represent the correlations between critical deviations and to process quality control data based on divide-and-conquer strategy. Such a network enables us to perform high-precision multi-step prognostic on the status of the fabrication process given the current state of the sensory info. Additionally, we introduce a layer-wise approach for efficient learning of the Bayesian-network parameters.

To achieve this, we propose a framework based on deep reinforcement learning that enables the dynamic orchestration of these three activities for the MEC network. The framework can implicitly predict user future requests using deep networks and push or cache the appropriate content to enhance performance. To address the curse of dimensionality resulting from considering three activities collectively, we adopt the soft actor-critic reinforcement learning in continuous space and design the action quantization and correction specifically to fit the discrete optimization problem. We conduct simulations in a single-user single-server MEC network setting and demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively decreases both transmission load and computing cost under various configurations of cache size and tolerable service delay.																			2334-0983	2576-6813	979-8-3503-1090-0				2023							1675	1680		10.1109/GLOBECOM54140.2023.10437459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM54140.2023.10437459													WOS:001178562002038

This paper investigates the study of the adaptive discrete-time neural network (NN) steering tracking control of the SbW system based on angular velocity observer. First, the continuous second-order SbW system is discretized by the Euler approximation approach. Before the control design, an adaptive discrete-time angular velocity observer is constructed to estimate the value of angular velocity signal. Then, an adaptive discrete-time control via a backstepping scheme is proposed to achieve the exact steering tracking performance, where the unknown nonlinear function, as well as the control coefficient, are incorporated into the lumped uncertainty and approximated by one NN. The main advantages of the proposed control scheme can be concluded that: (1) without using the exact prior knowledge of system uncertainty and angular position signal, the discrete-time tracking control is achieved and (2) the noncausal problem is overcome without transforming the original system into a predictor form. Finally, the Lyapunov stability theory shows that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero. Simulations and experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed adaptive discrete-time NN control.

According to the stochastic properties of transportation network flows, we first discuss the functional relations between the arcs and the nodes for modeling the transportation network systems. Then a new frequency-domain spanning graph model to analyze the network stochastic maximum flow and the stochastic minimum flow problem is presented. A corresponding algorithm is designed to resolve the model. In our solution, through the mutual transformations of probability functions between time-domain and frequency-domain in our model, the dynamic process of origin-destination flows is analyzed qualitatively; hence the minimum flow and maximum flow are derived quantitatively. An advantage of our approach is that it can handle uniformly both the continuous probability distribution case and the discrete probability distribution case. Numerical experiment results illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.																					978-988-98847-3-4				2008							31	+																WOS:000263624400004

In previous analytical studies on DQDB, the independent Bernoulli process of occupied slots has been assumed, which greatly diverges from the real behavior. To capture the temporal correlation of occupied dots, we model each DQDB station as a discrete-time polling system with the switched Bernoulli service process and a mixed service policy, where data segments receive 1-limited service, while requests receive gated service. We derive a set of equations, by which the first and higher moments of segment delay can be iteratively calculated. The present analysis exhibits good accuracy in numerical examples.																			0926-5473		0-444-81791-3				1993	39						149	160																WOS:A1993BZ97F00013

The expectation maximization algorithm is used to obtain the optimal estimation of the model's parameters, and the Viterbi algorithm is used to predict the CA delay in the current sampling period. Thus, the predicted CA delay and the measured sensor-to-controller (SC) delay in the current sampling period are used to design an optimal controller. Under this controller, the exponentially mean square stability of the NCS is guaranteed, and the SC and CA delays are compensated. Finally, the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper is demonstrated by a simulation example. Moreover, a comparative example is also given to illustrate the superiority of the SCHMM-based optimal controller over the discrete hidden Markov model (DHMM)-based optimal controller.

J	Liu, XZ; Zhang, KX				Liu, Xinzhi; Zhang, Kexue			Synchronization of linear dynamical networks on time scales: Pinning control via delayed impulses	AUTOMATICA												This paper studies the synchronization problem of complex dynamical networks (CDNs) on time scales. A pinning impulsive control scheme that takes into account of time-delay effects is designed to achieve synchronization of CDNs on time scales with the state of an isolated node. Based on the theory of time scales and the direct Lyapunov method, a synchronization criterion is established for linear CDNs on general time scales. Our result shows that, by impulsive control a small portion of nodes, the consensus of CDNs on time scales can be achieved. According to our pinning impulsive control scheme, different numbers of nodes will be selected at each impulsive instant and time delay is considered in the pinning impulses. The modeling framework developed in this paper is a unification and generalization of many existing continuous-time and discrete-time CDN models, while the pinning impulsive control scheme is an extension of the existing control scheme for synchronization of continuous-time CDNs. Moreover, the idea of studying dynamical systems on time scales provide a unified approach to investigate continuous time system and its discrete-time counterpart simultaneously. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In many network optimization problems presence of obstacles prohibits feasibility of a regular network design.

We focus on this application since fast and efficient allocation of suppliers to demand nodes is a critical process that impacts the results of the containment strategy.

Deep learning arc fault detection method requires a large number of experimental data to meet the diagnostic performance, and part of the experimental data is difficult to obtain, which increases the difficulty of model training. This paper presents an adaptive arc fault diagnosis model which provides data enhancement. In the data processing stage, the continuous time series can be discretely divided according to the half-period length, and the adaptive matrix transformation of the discrete sequence is carried out according to the convolution operation. At the same time, the generative adversarial network is used to enhance the original coding data of the carbonized path arc fault. In the training stage, an adaptive asymmetric convolution kernel is designed according to the data distribution characteristics of the coding matrix, which can effectively mine the continuous time information and correlation information in the time domain. Compared with the traditional convolutional neural network, the generative adversarial network can effectively enhance the data of carbonized path arc fault and improve the robustness of the diagnosis model. The adaptive asymmetric convolutional neural network improves the feature extraction of arc faults by convolutional layer and the ability of arc fault diagnosis.						, Charon1224/0000-0002-3469-283X													1530-437X	1558-1748				SEP 15	2021	21	18					20665	20673		10.1109/JSEN.2021.3099638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3099638													WOS:000703056000106

Such control systems typically arise in the computer control of continuous processes, for example, in manufacturing and chemical processes, in transporation systems,and in communication networks. A functional architecture of hybrid control systems consisting of a continuous plant, a discrete-event controller, and an interface is used to introduce and describe analysis and synthesis concepts and approaches. Our approach highlights the interaction between the continous and discrete dynamics, which is the cornerstone of any hybrid system study. Discrete abstractions are used to approximate the continous plant. Properties of the discrete abstractions to be appropriate representations of the continous plant are presented, and important concepts such as determinism and controllability are discussed.

In this paper, we investigate the offloading decision and resource allocation problem in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems based on RL methods. Different from existing literature, our research focuses on improving mobile operators' revenue by maximizing the amount of the offloaded tasks while decreasing the energy expenditure and time-delays. Considering the dynamic characteristics of wireless environment, the above problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Since the action space of the MDP is multidimensional continuous variables mixed with discrete variables, traditional RL algorithms are powerless. Therefore, an actor-critic (AC) with eligibility traces algorithm is proposed to resolve the problem. The actor part introduces the parameterized normal distribution to generate the probabilities of continuous stochastic actions, and the critic part employs a linear approximator to estimate the value of states, based on which the actor part updates policy parameters in the direction of performance improvement. Furthermore, an advantage function is designed to reduce the variance of the learning process. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can find the best strategy to maximize the amount of the tasks executed by the MEC server while decreasing the energy consumption and time-delays.

On-demand last-mile distribution network design with omnichannel inventory	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW												E-commerce delivery deadlines are getting increasingly tight, driven by a growing 'I-want it-now' instant gratification mindset of consumers and the desire of online and omnichannel retailers to capitalize on the growth of on-demand e-commerce. On-demand deliveries with delivery deadlines as tight as one or two hours force companies to rethink their last-mile distribution network, since tight delivery deadlines require decentralization of order picking and inventory holding to ensure close proximity to consumers. This fundamentally changes the strategic design process of last-mile distribution networks. We study the impact of incorporating inventory order-up-to level decisions into the strategic design process of last-mile distribution networks with tight delivery deadlines. We develop an approximate inventory model by including an estimate of the cost of late delivery and additional transportation due to local stock-outs in a newsvendor formulation. Such local stock-outs require an order to be delivered from a more distant facility, which may lead to late delivery and additional transportation cost. We integrate our approximate inventory model and a location-allocation mixed-integer program that determines optimal facility locations, associated order-up-to inventory levels, and fleet composition, into a metamodel simulation-based optimization approach. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that pooling the additional online inventory with brick-and-mortar (B&M) inventories leads to cannibalization by the B&M network and higher B&M service levels. However, the pooling benefits to the online network outweigh the cost of inventory cannibalization. Furthermore, we show under which circumstances omnichannel retailers may have an incentive to consolidate online inventory in specific B&M facilities.

Modeling the airline hub location and optimal market problems with continuous approximation techniques	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY												This paper presents continuous approximation techniques for the airline hub location and optimal market problems, and illustrates the usefulness of continuous approximation modeling in airline operations and network design with example applications. The continuous approximation models are developed for airline operations in restricted and unrestricted single-hub systems. The models can support strategic planning of many-to-many airline distribution systems. Using the proposed models, the effects of changing domestic air travel demand in the United States over the years on optimal hub location are evaluated. Different levels of indifference areas of the optimal hub location are also analyzed in order to investigate the sensitivity of the studied logistic problem to the hub location. It is found that none of the existing major airline hubs fall within the 5% indifference area. However, the 10% indifference areas include Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas, homes to United, Delta, and American Airlines, respectively. The impact of a competitive airline network structure with regard to the hub location is also studied. This study addresses a gap in the airline service planning literature on modeling the optimal market for an airline in a competitive structure with multiple airlines and already located hubs. Results from the continuous model can also provide guidelines for constructing solutions to the more detailed, but computationally heavy discrete design models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The networked control system is modeled based on a modified event-triggered scheme. In addition to the time interval between triggers, the characteristics of network communication are also considered. The time delay and packet loss are two important phenomena and are inevitable in networked control systems. A time delay model is presented to collect all types of delay and packet loss in the event-triggered networked control system. Also, dynamic delays between subsystems are considered. Based on this model, some new sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the stability and the H-infinity performance, based on LKF and integral estimation. The mixed Wirtinger-Jensen inequality is proposed to derive less conservative synthesis conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities. A decentralized event-triggered dynamic output feedback controller is designed based on the required stability conditions. Simulation results of a two coupled inverted pendulum and continuous stirred-tank reactors show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which guarantees the asymptotical stability with less number of data packets and the more maximum allowable time interval between packet releases, in comparison with the common networked control schemes.						ghaderi, reza/0000-0002-1499-6465													2195-268X	2195-2698				MAR	2021	9	1					149	159		10.1007/s40435-020-00649-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40435-020-00649-4													WOS:001054388500012

These are pulse shaping networks allowing transmission with minimum intersymbol interference in the time domain, while providing high amplitude selectivity and a close approximation to a constant group delay over the band of interest in the frequency domain. The technique gives the denominator of the filter transfer function in analytic closed form, while its numerator is determined by solving a set of linear algebraic equations. This results in a very powerful, yet simple and straightforward design method, in contrast to existing techniques which usually require the solution of nonlinear equations. Furthermore, all the frequency- and time-domain requirements appear simultaneously in the design without any need for subsequent corrections or equalization.																			1057-7122					JUL	1993	40	7					449	460		10.1109/81.257300	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/81.257300													WOS:A1993ME31600003

An event-triggered approach to distributed <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> state estimation for state-saturated systems with randomly occurring mixed delays	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												In this paper, the event-triggered distributed H-infinity state estimation problem is investigated for a class of state-saturated systems with randomly occurring mixed delays over sensor networks. The mixed delays, which comprise both discrete and distributed delays, are allowed to occur in a random manner governed by two mutually independent Bernoulli distributed random variables. In order to alleviate the communi-cation burden, an event-triggered mechanism is utilized for each sensor node to decide whether or not its current information should be broadcasted to its neighbors. The aim of this paper is to design event-triggered state estimators such that the error dynamics of state estimation is exponentially mean-square stable with a prescribed H-infinity performance index. By resorting to intensive stochastic analysis, sufficient conditions are first derived to guarantee the existence of the desired estimators, and the parameters of the desired distributed estimators are then obtained in light of the feasibility of a certain set of matrix inequalities. A numerical example is employed to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed distributed estimation algorithm. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This article demonstrates the single-to-multiple wavelength conversion via multiple four-wave mixings between a 10-Gbit/s return-to-zero signal and several continuous waves co-propagating in a dispersion-flattened highly non-linear photonic crystal fiber. For single-to-single channel wavelength conversion, a wide conversion range of 31 nm is achieved with the optimal conversion efficiency of -21.4 dB. By employing several continuous-wave probe lights, tunable single-to-dual and single-to-triple channel wavelength conversions are experimentally demonstrated, respectively. Moreover, the dynamic characteristics of the designed wavelength converter are studied under the conditions of variable input powers, polarization mismatch, and different lengths of the highly non-linear-photonic crystal fiber. The system is transparent to both bit rate and modulation format. This is very useful for engineering design and applications of optical-fiber-based wavelength converters in future ultra-high-speed photonic networks.																			0146-8030	1096-4681					2012	31	3					147	163		10.1080/01468030.2012.680001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01468030.2012.680001													WOS:000304836200001

Our optimization algorithm works over general strongly connected dynamic networks under switching topologies, e.g., in mobile multi-agent systems and volatile networks due to link failures. Compared to many existing lines of work, there is no need for bi-stochastic weight designs on the links. The existing literature mostly needs the link weights to be stochastic using specific weight-design algorithms needed both at the initialization and at all times when the topology of the network changes. This paper eliminates the need for such algorithms and paves the way for distributed optimization over time-varying digraphs. We derive the bound on the gradient-tracking step-size and discrete time-step for convergence and prove dynamic stability using arguments from consensus algorithms, matrix perturbation theory, and Lyapunov theory. This work, particularly, is an improvement over existing stochastic-weight undirected networks in case of link removal or packet drops. This is because the existing literature may need to rerun time-consuming and computationally complex algorithms for stochastic design, while the proposed strategy works as long as the underlying network is weight-symmetric and balanced. The proposed optimization framework finds applications to distributed classification and learning. Note to Practitioners-Inspired by recent advances in cloud-computing and distributed and parallel processing along with embedded low-cost CPUs and wireless communications, this paper considers distributed algorithms for optimization and machine learning over wireless-connected autonomous multi-agent systems (MASs). In contrast to the classical centralized learning methods, which are prone to single-point-of-failure and centralized processing, in cooperative optimization the learning is distributed among a group of data-processing agents (e.g. robots) with communication units. This article provides an efficient algorithm to enable MASs to collaboratively optimize a cost function, e.g., for binary classification and distributed support vector machine (D-SVM). Sampled data systems related to MASs and robotic networks, due to digital communications and discretized control models, use discrete-time algorithms that need to account for intermittent communications and dynamic networking. This requires discretized algorithms over dynamic digraphs, practical in the presence of packet drops (or lost communication channels). Most existing distributed algorithms either are susceptible to change in the communication network or impose computationally inefficient stochastic design. These algorithms need to be rerun, for example, whenever the mobile robotic network changes due to limited communication range. This makes most existing algorithms infeasible in real-time applications. Our proposed method outperforms similar algorithms over dynamic robotic networks and in the presence of link removal (packet drops). We show this efficiency of our distributed optimization method by simulation.

By the event-triggering strategies, only necessary samplings of feedback signals are determined to be released. The advantages are that redundant transmissions and updates can be reduced. By the adopted switching law, each sub-system will work for a minimum dwell time, and then a state-dependent switching starts to work. Specifically, by using discrete event-triggering strategies and considering the effects of transmission delays, a time-delay closed-loop switched system is first established. Then, by utilising multiple Lyapunov functions method, sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the stability of the closed-loop switched system with a certain performance level. In particular, since the switching instants and the event-triggered instants may be coupled, typical cases are discussed in detail. Moreover, the co-design conditions for state-feedback sub-controller gains and event-triggering parameters are developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations.

Unlike earlier studies to make use of analytical model for piezoelectric energy harvesting design, this work proposes an experimental method to design a piezoelectric energy harvesting skin using operating deflection shapes of a target mechanical system. This method is more practical in the sense that actual vibration of a target mechanical system can be characterized far better for the piezoelectric energy harvesting design. The key idea is to extract continuous in-plane normal strain values from discrete out-of-plane deformations of a target mechanical system. From multiple strain inflection lines, piezoelectric energy harvesting skin segments are designed to maximize a total power output. It is demonstrated that four piezoelectric energy harvesting skin segments designed by the proposed idea can generate sufficient power from the outdoor condensing unit of an air conditioning for self-powered operation of a wireless sensor network.

Instead of the continuous measurement, the sampled measurement is used to estimate the neuron states, and a sampled-data estimator is constructed. By converting the sampling period into a bounded time-varying delay, the error dynamics of the considered neural network is derived in terms of a dynamic system with two different time-delays. Subsequently, by choosing an appropriate Lyapunov functional and using the Jensen's inequality, a sufficient condition depending on the sampling period is obtained under which the resulting error system is exponentially stable. Then a sampled-data estimator is designed in terms of the solution to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be solved by using available software. Finally, a numerical example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampled-data estimation approach.																			0924-090X					JUL	2012	69	1-2					555	564		10.1007/s11071-011-0286-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-011-0286-x													WOS:000304651400043

Designing robust coverage networks to hedge against worst-case facility losses	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												In order to design a coverage-type service network that is robust to the worst instances of long-term facility loss, we develop a facility location-interdiction model that maximizes a combination of initial coverage by p facilities and the minimum coverage level following the loss of the most critical r facilities. The problem is formulated both as a mixed-integer program and as a bilevel mixed-integer program. To solve the bilevel program optimally, a decomposition algorithm is presented, whereby the original bilevel program is decoupled into an upper level master problem and a lower level subproblem. After sequentially solving these problems, supervalid inequalities can be generated and appended to the upper level master in an attempt to force it away from clearly dominated solutions. Computational results show that when solved to optimality, the bilevel decomposition algorithm is up to several orders of magnitude faster than performing branch and bound on the mixed-integer program.

Robust Optimization of Storage Investment on Transmission Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS												This paper discusses the need for the integration of storage systems on transmission networks having renewable sources, and presents a tool for energy storage planning. The tool employs robust optimization to minimize the investment in storage units that guarantee a feasible system operation, without load or renewable power curtailment, for all scenarios in the convex hull of a discrete uncertainty set; it is termed ROSION-Robust Optimization of Storage Investment On Networks. The computational engine in ROSION is a specific tailored implementation of a column-and-constraint generation algorithm for two-stage robust optimization problems, where a lower and an upper bound on the optimal objective function value are successively calculated until convergence. The lower bound is computed using mixed-integer linear programming and the upper bound via linear programming applied to a sequence of similar problems.

A network communication channel is assumed to be existing between the plant and the fault detection filter, and three types of incomplete measurements which typically appear in a network environment are simultaneously addressed, including measurement quantisation effect, signal transmission delay and data packet dropout. A mathematical model is presented to account for those issues in a unified form. Based on that, a full-order fault detection filter is designed such that the residual system is asymptotically stable and preserves a guaranteed performance. A sufficient condition of the existence of the fault detection filter is obtained and all the results are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities, which can be readily solved via standard numerical software. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the usefulness of the developed theoretical results.

In a hybrid multi-agent system, continuous-time and discrete-time agents concurrently exist and communicate through local interaction. We introduce the notion of heterogeneous robustness to capture the topological structure and facilitate convergence analysis of hybrid agents over multiple subnetworks, where the exact number and identities of malicious agents are not known. A hybrid resilient strategy is first designed to ensure group consensus of the heterogeneously robust network admitting completely distributed implementation. We then develop a scaled consensus protocol which allows different clusters within each subnetwork, providing further flexibility over the resilient control tasks. Finally, some numerical examples are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.																			0170-4214	1099-1476				JAN 30	2021	44	2					1456	1469		10.1002/mma.6844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mma.6844		SEP 2020											WOS:000565390400001

Applications include performance evaluation in communication networks, production systems, supply chains, and the implementation of sequence controllers. Timed Continuous Petri Net (TCPN) systems are continuous-state models that can approximate the dynamical behavior of discrete Markovian Petri nets (MPN). Based on this, an estimator-based control structure is introduced here for applying a control law designed for a TCPN into the original discrete system. The result is a control policy for driving a MPN system in such a way that the mean value of its marking will reach a desired value, by applying additional delays to the controllable transitions. A stock level control of a Kanban-based automotive assembly line is synthesized as an application example.

A software package in PASCAL and LISP to implement these algorithms is developed. In addition, a simple z-domain inversion algorithm used in the computer implementation of bilinear s-z tranSformation is also included in the software package. These algorithms play an important role in the analysis and synthesis of complex electrical networks and control systems. Especially, the s-domain expansion and inversion algorithms have potential applications in model simplification and system order reductions. The paper also shows that the package, as such, serves as a comprehensive computer-aided analysis and design (CAD) toolkit for both continuous and discrete systems. The software is interactive and runs on computers equipped with a PASCAL or LISP compiler. It is noted that the iterative implementation of these methods using the new continued fraction algorithms saves considerable memory space and processing time.

In this paper, broadcast beamforming design with antenna selection is considered for cognitive radio networks. In the presence of primary users, it is usually difficult to satisfy quality of service (QoS) constraints of the all secondary users while keeping the interference towards the primary users below a certain threshold. User selection is a good method in order to make the problem feasible. In this paper, discrete phase-only beamforming is considered due to its simplicity and certain advantages. The joint problem is converted into linear form and solved optimally by using mixed integer linear programming. Simulation results show that significant power saving is possible compared to fixed antenna systems.

In this paper, a digital receding horizon learning controller is proposed for continuous-time nonlinear systems with control constraints. The main idea is to develop a digital design for RL with actor-critic design (ACD) in the framework of MPC, to realize near-optimal control of continuous-time nonlinear systems. Different from classic RL for continuous-time systems, the actor adopted is learned in discrete-time steps, while the critic evaluates the learned control policy continuously in the time domain Moreover, we use soft barrier functions to deal with control constraints and the robustness of the actor-critic network is proven. A simulation example is considered to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The networked filtering system with packet losses is described as a discrete-time linear switched system. A sufficient condition for the filtering error system to be exponentially stable and to ensure a prescribed H (a) performance is derived by using a piecewise continuous Lyapunov function approach and the average dwell time method. The obtained condition establishes a quantitative relation between the packet loss rate and the H (a) filtering performance.

J	Lin, DT; Liu, Y				Lin, Dongting; Liu, Yuan			Discrete phase shifts control and beam selection in RIS-aided MISO system via deep reinforcement learning	CHINA COMMUNICATIONS												Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for wireless networks have drawn lots of attention in both academic and industry communities. RIS can dynamically control the phases of the reflection elements to send the signal in the desired direction, thus it provides supplementary links for wireless networks. Most of prior works on RIS-aided wireless communication systems consider continuous phase shifts, but phase shifts of RIS are discrete in practical hardware. Thus we focus on the actual discrete phase shifts on RIS in this paper. Using the advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming matrix from the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook at the base station (BS) and the discrete phase shifts at the RIS to maximize the received signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR). Unlike the traditional schemes usually using alternate optimization methods to solve the transmit beamforming and phase shifts, the DRL algorithm proposed in the paper can jointly design the transmit beamforming and phase shifts as the output of the DRL neural network. Numerical results indicate that the DRL proposed can dispose the complicated optimization problem with low computational complexity.																			1673-5447					AUG	2023	20	8					198	208		10.23919/JCC.fa.2022-0128.202308	http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/JCC.fa.2022-0128.202308													WOS:001060514100015

In general, there exist a plethora of Pareto-optimal policies that embody different patterns of compromises between objectives, and it is technically challenging to obtain them exhaustively using deep neural networks. In this work, we propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm that trains a single neural network via policy gradient to approximately obtain the entire Pareto set in a single run of training, without relying on linear scalarization of objectives. The proposed method works in both continuous and discrete action spaces with no design change of the policy network. Numerical experiments demonstrate the practicality and efficacy of our approach in comparison to standard MORL baselines.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-031-44222-3; 978-3-031-44223-0				2023	14259						63	76		10.1007/978-3-031-44223-0_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-44223-0_6													WOS:001156951000006

We consider a superstructure consisting of water sources, regenerators, and sinks that leads to a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP) for a fixed-flowrate total water network synthesis problem. Uncertainty in the problem is accounted for via a recourse-based two-stage stochastic programming formulation with discrete scenarios that gives rise to a multiscenario MIQCQP comprising network design in the first stage and its operation in the second stage acting as recourse. In addition, we extend the model to address risk management using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) metric. Because a large number of scenarios is often required to capture the underlying uncertainty of the problem, causing the model to suffer from the curse of dimensionality, we propose a stepwise solution strategy to reduce the computational load. We illustrate this methodology on a case study inspired from the water network of a petroleum refinery in Malaysia. The presence of nonconvex bilinear terms necessitates the use of global optimization techniques for which we employ a new global MIQCQP solver, GAMS/GloMIQO and verify the solutions with BARON. Our computational results show that total water network synthesis under uncertainty with risk management problems can be solved to global optimality in reasonable time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is assumed in this problem that measurement output is only available at sampling instants, and the value of the control input only updates at those sampling instants. To solve this problem, a sampled-data output feedback control based on distributed continuous-discrete observer is proposed. This new algorithm has the performance that the sampling period can be freely chosen. We then show the asymptotic stability of the equivalent discrete-time system transformed from sampled-data closed-loop system.

A sampled-data observer is presented by using the sampled and delayed measured outputs. The observer has continuous variables and discrete variables. The network-induced delay, which may be larger or less than the sampling period, is also taken into consideration in the observer design. Therefore, the observer is hybrid in nature. It is proven that the observer errors are globally and exponentially convergent. The sampled-data observer design method is also extended to nonlinear systems with lower triangular form.

In this problem, a set of warehouses must be selected within a set of potential locations to serve several customers or demand zones, additionally involving the selection of the suppliers for fulfilling incoming orders from the located warehouses. The optimal solution must be determined while minimizing total system costs including supplier selection, transportation (i.e., suppliers-warehouses and warehouses-customers), inventory (i.e., cycle and safety stock), and warehouse location costs. A key element of the problem is the consideration of variable lead-times for the warehouses, which are dependent on the selection of the supplier that serve them, thus increasing model complexity. Accordingly, an efficient algorithm based on the Generalized Benders Decomposition is developed and implemented to solve the proposed Mixed Integer, Nonlinear, Nonconvex, Programming Model. The proposed solution approach relies on a convenient model formulation and decomposition that yields a Mixed Integer Linear master problem and a continuous, convex subproblem. A wide set of medium-sized synthetic instances are optimally solved in affordable times, denoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model along with the proposed solution approach. Significant scientific and managerial insights are provided and discussed.

The proposed framework exhibits a structured information exchange leading to an efficient search procedure. The utility of the method is demonstrated by applying it to the design of an unsplit heat exchanger network. We also extend the basic idea of genetic algorithms to develop a new method, called the extended genetic search (EGS), for optimization in continuous spaces. The performance of the extended genetic search for several test cases of nonlinear unconstrained and constrained optimization problems is also presented. We also compare the performance of this technique with others, including simulated annealing. The proposed framework turns out to be quite robust and is able to locate global optimum solutions for problems where gradient-based algorithms fail. The results obtained were comparable to the ones obtained with simulated annealing. The implementational simplicity of the EGS framework makes it particularly useful as a tool for problems where approximate solutions are needed quickly.																			0098-1354					APR	1991	15	4					217	228		10.1016/0098-1354(91)85009-J	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0098-1354(91)85009-J													WOS:A1991FN42500002

Cole			Decomposition Algorithms for the Design of a Nonsimultaneous Capacitated Evacuation Tree Network	NETWORKS												In this article, we examine the design of an evacuation tree, in which evacuation is subject to capacity restrictions on arcs. The cost of evacuating people in the network is determined by the sum of penalties incurred on arcs on which they travel, where penalties are determined according to a nondecreasing function of time. Given a discrete set of disaster scenarios affecting network population, arc capacities, transit times, and penalty functions, we seek to establish an optimal a priori evacuation tree that minimizes the expected evacuation penalty. The solution strategy is based on Benders decomposition, in which the master problem is a mixed-integer program and each subproblem is a time-expanded network flow problem. We provide efficient methods for obtaining primal and dual subproblem solutions, and analyze techniques for improving the strength of the master problem formulation, thus reducing the number of master problem solutions required for the algorithm's convergence. We provide computational results to compare the efficiency of our methods on a set of randomly generated test instances. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

There is distinct treatment for delays longer than one sampling period, since these are decomposed to a term which is integer multiple of the sampling period and a residual which can be time-varying.

J	Aghababa, MP				Aghababa, Mohammad Pourmahmood			Fractional-Neuro-Optimizer: A Neural-Network-Based Optimization Method	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS												Up to now, there have been many attempts in the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for solving optimization problems and some types of ANNs, such as Hopfield network and Boltzmann machine, have been applied for combinatorial optimization problems. However, there are some restrictions in the use of ANNs as optimizers. For example: (1) ANNs cannot optimize continuous variable problems; (2) discrete problems should be mapped into the neural networks' architecture; and (3) most of the existing neural networks are applicable only for a class of smooth optimization problems and global convexity conditions on the objective functions and constraints are required. In this paper, we introduce a new procedure for stochastic optimization by a recurrent ANN. The concept of fractional calculus is adopted to propose a novel weight updating rule. The introduced method is called fractional-neuro-optimizer (FNO). This method starts with an initial solution and adjusts the network's weights by a new heuristic and unsupervised rule to reach a good solution.

J	El-Farra, NH; Gani, A; Christofides, PD				El-Farra, NH; Gani, A; Christofides, PD			Analysis of mode transitions in biological networks	AICHE JOURNAL												This work presents a methodology for the analysis of mode transitions in biological networks. The proposed approach is predicated on the notion of orchestrating switching between the domains of attraction of the steady states of the constituent modes. Initially, the overall network is modeled as a switched nonlinear system that consists of multiple modes, each governed by a set of continuous-time differential equations. The transitions between the continuous modes are triggered by discrete events (changes in model parameters that correspond to alterations in physiological conditions). Then, following the characterization of the steady-state behavior of each mode, Lyapunov techniques are used to characterize the domains of attraction of the steady states. Finally, by analyzing how the domains of attraction of the various modes overlap with one other, a switching rule is derived to determine when, and if a given mode transition at a given time results in the desired steady-state behavior. The proposed method is demonstrated using models of biological networks that arise in cell cycle regulation and the bacteriophage A-switch system.

Conventionally, the key generation and the key consumption were considered separately, thus potentially leading to a possible mismatch between them and significantly degrading the network efficiency. A few studies considered these two parts jointly but assumed the worst noise condition, which may lead to an over-supply of quantum keys. In this paper, we propose a noise-aware resource allocation (NARA) scheme and design a framework to balance the generation and the consumption of quantum keys for CV-QKD over WDM networks. We formulate the NARA problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. An efficient heuristic algorithm with three allocation schemes, including threshold-based noise loading (TNL), stress-based noise loading (SNL), and noise margin reservation (NMR), has been designed. Simulation results show that NARA with the NMR scheme can significantly reduce the total number of wavelengths used and the total network cost under all system parameters by more than 10% and 20%, respectively, compared to the other two schemes.

Correspondingly, some novel numerical methods have been proposed to analyze the security of these protocols against collective attacks, which promotes key rates over one hundred kilometers of fiber distance. However, numerical methods are limited by their calculation time and resource consumption, for which they cannot play more roles on mobile platforms in quantum networks. To improve this issue, a neural network model predicting key rates in nearly real time has been proposed previously. Here, we go further and show a neural network model combined with Bayesian optimization. This model automatically designs the best architecture of neural network computing key rates in real time. We demonstrate our model with two variants of CV QKD protocols with quaternary modulation. The results show high reliability with secure probability as high as 99.15% - 99.59%, considerable tightness and high efficiency with speedup of approximately 10(7) in both cases. This inspiring model enables the real-time computation of unstructured quantum key distribution protocols' key rate more automatically and efficiently, which has met the growing needs of implementing QKD protocols on moving platforms.

The average impulsive interval technique and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) method are employed to derive sufficient conditions for the effect of the time delay in the leakage term on FTB in presence of destabilizing impulses. These conditions are in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be numerically checked. Moreover, a state delay-free feedback control is designed to ensure the FTB-stabilization for impulsive HONNNs.

Such hybrid systems arise in varied contexts in manufacturing, communication networks, auto pilot design, automotive engine control, computer synchronization, traffic control, and chemical processes, among others. Hybrid systems have a central role in embedded control systems that interact with the physical world.

The UAV is assumed to operate at a fixed altitude and is responsible for the wireless communication to a ground deployed user within a given operation duration. We characterize out the achieved throughput by taking the discrete code rate selections into account and formulate a throughput maximization problem optimizing the continuous UAV trajectory. To deal with the discrete features resulting from the practically finite rate selections, we adopt a mechanical equivalence based strategy for the trajectory design. In particular, via problem reformulation, we completely represent the trajectory design problem by a mechanical rope problem minimizing the overall potential energy of the rope. As a result, alternatively optimizing the rope shape in equilibrium state will be capable of equivalently addressing the trajectory design. Based on the discrete features in artificial potential field (APF) and the resulting impulse force field, we analyze out all the possible rope solutions in equilibrium state, while respectively assuming the rope in loose and tight statuses. As a result, the optimal rope solution, as well as the equivalent optimal UAV trajectory, can be eventually obtained. Finally, via simulations, we validated our obtained optimal solution under discrete code rates, while the impacts of different discrete code rate set on the optimal solution are also illustrated.																			2164-7038		979-8-3503-3307-7				2023							1660	1665		10.1109/ICCWORKSHOPS57953.2023.10283514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCWORKSHOPS57953.2023.10283514													WOS:001094861300273

Network modeling of multiple-port, multiple-vibration-mode transducers and resonators	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL												A modeling procedure is presented for multiple-port, multiple-vibration-mode transducers. Unique features of the procedure include the use of modal coordinates to describe deformations of the mechanical structure, the use of a network analog for each vibration mode of the structure, and the selection of modal velocity, rather than a particular physical velocity on the structure, as the mechanical flow variable in each modal network. Finite element analysis is used only to compute a discrete set of salient circuit parameters, with all other analysis and design computations performed using the networks. The approach is computationally efficient and assists with providing insights into the design of actuators and micromechanical resonators, where the generation and suppression of particular vibration modes may be important. A micromachined, multiple-port piezoelectric microphone with in-plane directivity is presented as a case study to demonstrate application of the procedure. Model verification is performed by comparing simulated and measured port-to-port transfer functions over a frequency range spanning several vibration modes of the device. The modeling procedure can address multiple-port sensor response to distributed loadings, selective excitation and suppression of modes in actuator applications, and mixed sensing and actuator applications such as the demonstrated port-to-port measurements.

Unlike the existing designs relying on continuous-time information exchanges, a novel sampled-data networking strategy is introduced, which is more reliable and practical in realistic communication networks. Specifically, we focus on the analysis of continuous-time rigid body dynamics with non-uniform discrete-time information exchanges in the communication network. In particular, the sampling period is assumed to be time-varying and governed by a Markov chain. Furthermore, the relative angular velocity information between neighbouring rigid bodies is not required, such that the communication network burden can be further reduced. Another important and distinct feature of our synchronization scheme is that the communication energy consumption can be effectively decreased, since the communication network is utilized more efficiently. Based on model transformation and stochastic stability analysis, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the synchronization can be achieved. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness and benefits of our proposed results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, at this stage, manual trial and error is needed to construct the CNN. Moreover, the model is designed for specific datasets, which will cause domain bias when applied to a new dataset. Therefore, a novel differentiable neural architecture search method is proposed to automatically construct a GIS PD pattern recognition model. First, a factorized hierarchical search space is used to design the CNN architecture. Then, a discrete search space is relaxed into a continuous search space through a search strategy based on Gumbel-softmax.

J	Lou, YY; Zhang, LH				Lou, Yingyan; Zhang, Lihui			Defending Transportation Networks Against Random and Targeted Attacks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												This paper explores several reliability and vulnerability measures for transportation networks and proposes three models for optimal resource allocation for transportation network design or defense to minimize the disruption caused by both random and targeted attacks. The common day to-day disturbances with less severe consequences are referred to as ran tom attacks, but targeted attacks include both coordinated terrorist strikes and large-scale natural disasters. For random attacks, the major concern would be the reliability of the total system travel time. A robust discrete network design problem is formulated to take into account random attacks in the planning stage. The transport capacity or the unsatisfied demand would be critical in case of emergency evacuation, and law enforcement forces could be deployed to prevent malicious attacks in the first place or to ensure a smooth evacuation operation. The proposed models feature an intrinsic trilevel game structure of the network users, the attacker, and the defender (planner). By exploring the unique properties of the proposed measures and reformulating the problems, the trilevel structure models are reduced to mixed-integer semi-infinite optimization programs. This paper further applies an active-set algorithm, combined with a cutting-plane scheme to solve the proposed models. Numerical examples indicate that the proposed formulations are valid and that the solution algorithm can solve the problems effectively and efficiently. The models for targeted attacks provide practical implications on identifying critical infrastructures for evacuation.																			0361-1981	2169-4052					2011		2234					31	40		10.3141/2234-04	http://dx.doi.org/10.3141/2234-04													WOS:000299798500005

Continuous Petri nets can be seen as a relaxation of discrete models allowing more efficient (in some cases polynomial time) analysis and synthesis algorithms. Nevertheless computational costs can be reduced at the expense of the analyzability of some properties. Even more, some net systems do not allow any kind of continuization. The present work first considers these aspects and some of the alternative formalisms usable for continuous relaxations of discrete systems. Particular emphasis is done later on the presentation of some results concerning performance evaluation, parametric design and marking (i.e., state) observation and control.

The drive-response set is discussed. A novel controller is designed such that the response (slave) system can be controlled to synchronize with the drive (master) system. Through a nonlinear transformation, we get an alternative system from the considered memristor-based Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. By investigating the global exponential synchronization of the alternative system, we obtain the corresponding synchronization criteria of the considered memristor-based Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Moreover, the conditions established in this paper are easy to be verified and improve the conditions derived in most of existing papers concerning stability and synchronization for memristor-based neural networks.

A Continuous Petri Net Approach for Model Predictive Control of Traffic Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS												Traffic systems are often highly populated discrete event systems that exhibit several modes of behavior such as free flow traffic, traffic jams, stop-and-go waves, etc. An appropriate closed loop control of the congested system is crucial in order to avoid undesirable behavior. This paper proposes a macroscopic model based on continuous Petri nets as a tool for designing control laws that improve the behavior of traffic systems. The main reason to use a continuous model is to avoid the state explosion problem inherent to large discrete event systems. The obtained model captures the different operation modes of a traffic system and is highly compositional. In order to handle the variability of the traffic conditions, a model predictive control strategy is proposed and validated.					/B-4216-2019	/0000-0002-7093-228X													1083-4427	1558-2426				JUL	2010	40	4					686	697		10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2041448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2041448													WOS:000278814100004

Transportat Res Board				Automated people movers (APMs) have become an attractive solution to mobility problems associated with large airport terminals. A hybrid computer simulation model (called APMSIM) that has been developed to simplify the operational analysis of airport APM systems is presented. Given an airport passenger demand function, along with various APM vehicle technology and airport terminal characteristics, the model estimates time-varying level-of-service characteristics of the terminal including queues and processing times. The model simulates the movement of individual passengers and APM vehicles in the system network. APMSIM constitutes a design tool for airport planners and designers for determination of the sensitivity of system performance for a range of APM design parameters, examination of the flexibility of an APM system under given operational policy and network configurations, and estimation of APM vehicle energy consumption on the basis of network constraints and system characteristics. The model is a hybrid discrete-event and continuous simulation model developed in EXTEND, a general-purpose simulation software.																			0361-1981		0-309-06684-0				2000		1703					45	57																WOS:000176780600007

Reliable mixed H<sub>∞</sub>/passive control for T-S fuzzy delayed systems based on a semi-Markov jump model approach	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS												This paper investigates the problem of the reliable mixed H-infinity/passive control for Takagi Sugeno (T S) fuzzy delayed systems based on a semi-Markov jump model (SMJM) approach. The focus is to design a fuzzy fault-tolerant controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is stochastically stable with a prescribed mixed H-infinity/passive performance level even if the actuator failures appear. A semi-Markov process is employed to describe the encountered failures of the actuator. By applying the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, in combination with some novel inequalities, some conditions on the performance analysis are established, where some negative quadratic terms are fully considered to reduce the conservatism. Based on the conditions, an explicit expression for the desired controller is given. Three numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness and reduced conservatism of the proposed method.

The on-chip event bus of the proposed chip was designed with newly designed hardware for the event tracer for delayed-data propagation and the floating-point synchronizer for continuous time operation of the discrete-event system concept. This technique replaces the global bus network with the event bus and the local tracer bus, which enables a reduction of the dynamic current by preventing the propagation of the global bus transition. Using the on-chip event bus, the traditional on-chip debugger (OCD) blocks can be removed except the event-matching block, and most of the comparator logics for OCD can be moved off the target chip. We designed a USB-to-event converter dongle to replace the on-chip debugger hardware with the off-chip system and software on the host PC side for the interoperation of the DEVS simulator and OCD. With the proposed event bus and event OCD block, the logic gates needed for the large OCD block are reduced. The DEVS simulator on a host PC is virtually connected via the USB-to-event converter dongle to the event-driven OCD implemented in the target chip. The implemented chip uses less than about 25% of the operating current used by experimental chip based on the traditional on-chip bus network. The experimental chip was implemented with 18,000 logic gates and a 4Kbyte SRAM buffer for the experimental target chip.																			0735-9276		978-1-61839-786-7				2012	44	4					239	246																WOS:000398882100033

With the continuous development of deep learning technology, network traffic classification technology starts to use supervised learning paradigm to automate traffic identification by extracting some features. However, due to the continuous emergence of new private protocols, network services and access devices, the overall distribution of network traffic data is constantly changing. The training of network traffic classification models usually relies on the labeled data collected by academic organizations, institutions and companies. These data are usually generated in a fixed network environment, and the types of labels collected are limited. Models trained in this way are difficult to adapt to the open and complex network environment. Furthermore, the unevenly distributed computing resources affect the model training efficiency because the collected traffic data is usually concentrated in the end system but the computing power is generally concentrated in the edge computing nodes and cloud centers. Federated learning technology can coordinate data holders to train globally adapted models from discrete data. At the same time, split learning technology can realize more efficient model separation training. In this paper, we designed a new three-tier algorithm Hier-SFL combining and improving these two learning frameworks according to the common client-edge-cloud structure. Hier-SFL algorithm allocated the training task of neural network to each level network device with different computing resources. Also, it took the advantage of federated learning to periodically aggregate network parameters. Thus, we significantly improved the training efficiency of the deep learning model of traffic classification.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main problem of the NCSs is that data are transmitted via a communication channel which has a constraint of capacity by converting a continuous signal into a discrete signal by using quantizer to compress the amount of information. Therefore, the discrete signal has a margin of error called quantization error. In the quantized feedback control systems, we use an observer to estimate a state if the state is not available, and use the estimated state in feedback control. In such cases, the system may be unstable and degraded the performance since the states estimation is not performed properly due to the quantization error. Hence, an state estimator must be designed with taking into account the effect of quantization error. In this paper, we propose a designing state estimator method in discrete-time systems with the quantized output. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated with experiments.

NON-FRAGILE EXTENDED DISSIPATIVITY CONTROL DESIGN FOR GENERALIZED NEURAL NETWORKS WITH INTERVAL TIME-DELAY SIGNALS	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												The problem of non-fragile extended dissipative control design for a class of generalized neural networks (GNNs) with interval time-delay signals is investigated in this paper. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with double and triple integral terms, and estimating their derivative by using the Wirtinger single integral inequality (WSII) and Wirtinger double integral inequality (WDII) technique respectively, and that is mixed with the reciprocally convex combination (RCC) approach. A new delay-dependent non-fragile extended dissipative control design for GNNs are expressed in terms of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, the desired non-fragile extended dissipative controller can be obtained by solving the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, a non-fragile state feedback controller is designed for GNNs such that the closed-loop system is extended dissiptive. Thus, the non-fragile extended dissipative controller can be adopted to deal with the non-fragile L-2-L-infinity performance, non-fragile H-infinity performance, non-fragile passive performance, non-fragile mixed H-infinity and passivity performance, and non-fragile dissipative performance for GNNs by selecting the weighting matrices. Finally, simulation studies are demonstrated for showing the feasibility of the proposed method. Among them, one example was supported by the real-life application of the quadruple tank process system.

J	Kaznessis, YN				Kaznessis, YN			Multi-scale models for gene network engineering	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												With current advances in biological knowledge, the potential exists for engineering novel gene regulatory networks, which allow the timely control of protein expression. Genome projects identify the components of gene networks in biological organisms, gene after gene, and DNA microarray experiments discover the network connections. Yet, the static pictures these experiments give cannot provide insight on the dynamic behavior of gene networks. The large number of components and interactions involved in dynamic gene regulation warrants a quantitative, computational perspective for investigating the dynamic behavior. The challenge lies with the fact that the timescales of phenomena involved in transcription/translation span multiple orders of magnitude. In this paper, multi-scale simulation methods developed to model gene regulatory networks are discussed. Details are provided for modeling biomolecular systems away from the thermodynamic limit and a hybrid algorithm is presented for simulating stochastic systems that contain both discrete and continuous representations. These simulations can provide useful insight for rationally engineering the components and the connections of novel gene network modules. Two examples, the bistable switch and the oscillator, are discussed. These examples demonstrate that ensembles of stochastic trajectories can provide insight into the dynamics of biomolecular interaction networks. This insight can guide the changes needed for the network to exhibit the desired dynamic behavior. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In artificial neural networks, symmetry has been a central design principle to efficiently capture regularities in the world, but the role of symmetry breaking is not well understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to study the geometry of learning dynamics in neural networks, and reveal a key mechanism of explicit symmetry breaking behind the efficiency and stability of modern neural networks. To build this understanding, we model the discrete learning dynamics of gradient descent using a continuous-time Lagrangian formulation, in which the learning rule corresponds to the kinetic energy and the loss function corresponds to the potential energy. Then, we identify kinetic symmetry breaking (KSB), the condition when the kinetic energy explicitly breaks the symmetry of the potential function. We generalize Noether's theorem known in physics to take into account KSB and derive the resulting motion of the Noether charge: Noether's Learning Dynamics (NLD). Finally, we apply NLD to neural networks with normalization layers and reveal how KSB introduces a mechanism of implicit adaptive optimization, establishing an analogy between learning dynamics induced by normalization layers and RMSProp. Overall, through the lens of Lagrangian mechanics, we have established a theoretical foundation to discover geometric design principles for the learning dynamics of neural networks.																			1049-5258						2021	34																							WOS:000922928400012

J	Nahm, YE; Ishikawa, H				Nahm, YE; Ishikawa, H			A hybrid multi-agent system architecture for enterprise integration using computer networks	ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING												The manufacturing industries are now experiencing fierce pressure of competition from every corner on this planet. In addition, the advancement in computer networks and information technologies has been gradually reshaping the manufacturing companies by shifting from the industrial age to the information era. Due to these elevated competitiveness and advanced computer technology, a number of new manufacturing and management strategies (e.g., CE or CIM) have emerged for the innovation of manufacturing enterprises. Although they have different definitions and scopes, there are several common issues: inter-enterprise functions integration; inter-enterprise resources integration; and collaboration. This paper proposes a new multi-agent system (MAS) architecture to support the inter-enterprise functions/resources integration and collaboration over the networked environment, including the hybrid agent architecture and hybrid network architecture. In contrast to the existing agent architectures, the proposed agent architecture enables agents to exhibit the hybrid (continuous and discrete) behavior and interactions. In addition, our network architecture is more suitable for building the large-scale distributed manufacturing systems that are prone to dynamic random changes of their environment. Based on the proposed MAS architecture, a collaborative product development environment is implemented as a starting point, and a multidisciplinary team-oriented design problem is illustrated to provide the vision of the proposed MAS architecture.

The objective is to design a scheme that achieves high throughput and low delay simultaneously. We propose a scheduling scheme that - for networks operating tinder primary interference constraints - guarantees a per-flow end-to-end packet delay bound of 5d(j)/1-rho(j), at a factor 5 loss of throughput, where d(j) is the path length (number of hops) of How j and rho(j) is the effective loading along the route of flow j. Clearly, d(j) is a universal lower bound on end-to-end packet delay for flow j. Thus, our result is essentially optimal. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first one to show that it is possible to achieve a per-flow end-to-end delay bound of O(# of hops) in a constrained network. Designing such a scheme comprises two related subproblems: Global Scheduling and Local Scheduling. Global Scheduling involves determining the set of links that will be simutaneously active, without violating the scheduling constraints. While local scheduling involves determining the packets that will be transferred across active edges. We design a local scheduling scheme by adapting the Preemptive Last-In-First-Out, (PL) scheme, applied for quasi-reversible continuous time networks, to an unconstrained discrete-time network. A global scheduling scheme will be obtained by using stable marriage algorithms to emulate the unconstrained network with the constrained wireless network. Our scheme can be easily extended to a network operating tinder general scheduling constraints, such as secondary interference constraints, with the same delay bound and a loss of throughput that depends on scheduling constraints through an intriguing "sub-graph covering" property.

While the importance of robustness in engineering design is well accepted, it is less clear how to verify and design discrete systems for robustness. We present a theory of input-output robustness for discrete systems inspired by existing notions of input-output stability (IO-stability) in continuous control theory. We show that IO-stability captures two intuitive goals of robustness: bounded disturbances lead to bounded deviations from nominal behavior, and the effect of a sporadic disturbance disappears in finitely many steps. We show that existing notions of robustness for discrete systems do not have these two properties. For systems modeled as finite-state transducers, we show that IO-stability can be verified and the synthesis problem can be solved in polynomial time. We illustrate our theory using a reference broadcast synchronization protocol for wireless networks.

Due to this popularity, there has been a tremendous increase in use of these services and as a result, leakages of both location and query contents is common. In a case where users are constrained by road network, an attacker can follow users' trajectory with ease. Most of the current privacy preserving solutions focus on temporal and spatial cloaking based methods to protect users' location privacy. However, these solutions are vulnerable when subjected to continuous query environments. In this paper, we offer our solution to the problem of preserving privacy of users' trajectory for continuous LBS queries in road networks. We propose a centralized architecture in form of honest-but-curious model to provide anonymity for users as they use LBS services. To achieve this, we employ mix zone approach and design two algorithms namely; Optimal Mixing Load Sub-graph (OMLS) Algorithm that finds an optimal placement of mix zones and creates three levels of security, and Semantically Based Graph Abstraction (SBGA) Algorithm that uses the three layers of security to achieve greater anonymity strength. We analyze the capability of our algorithms to withstand attacks prone to mix zones and carry out experiments to verify this. The experiments results show that our Algorithms preserves privacy for users based on their privacy condition.					memon, Imran/K-1647-2017	memon, Imran/0000-0002-8202-6604													2155-1456		978-1-4799-3985-5				2013							352	+																WOS:000349842800087

A hierarchical approach is developed. First, a formulation is developed to account for the anticipated schedules and heat integration during the design phase. Because of the complexity of the formulation for heat integration with varying flows and temperatures, a new targeting approach has been introduced. A linearization approach is adopted by discretizing the searched space for temperatures. Then, integer cuts are added to select the optimal temperatures. This results in a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the targeting of minimum heating and cooling utilities for the various schedules. In order to synthesize a flexible configuration of the heat integration network, a multiperiod formulation is developed to account for the variations associated with the anticipated schedules.

However, CZNN is not friendly to digital devices and hardware implementation. Although discrete ZNN (DZNN) has been investigated in other tasks, all the existing DZNNs are designed with fixed time steps, which cannot meet the needs of different tasks. This motivates us to develop a generic DZNN model with variable number of time steps and apply it to continuum robot control. In this article, we present a data-driven scheme based on CZNNs to learn the unknown kinematics of continuum robots and solve the kinematic control problem. Furthermore, a unified m-step forward discretization formula is derived to discretize the CZNN-based scheme into DZNN-based control algorithms. Finally, we take the 1-step and the 3-step algorithms as examples to show the discretization process, and verify their efficacy by simulations and experiments.

Despite the limited sensing capability and range of the individual sensors, the surveillance network can track targets over a large region based on transferring the target tracking task. The challenge for such large scale networked systems is to design an efficient and scalable modeling and analysis tool and devise stable control algorithms for accomplishing the surveillance task. Mutational analysis and shape based control have been proposed to overcome the limitations of current feature (point) based visual servoing techniques, however, they fail to capture the discrete switching nature of the surveillance task of tracking the target using multiple sensors. This paper presents a mutational hybrid model for such pervasive surveillance networks which retains the advantages of using mutational equations while also being able to model the discrete switching between various sensors. We also present an example pervasive surveillance scenario modeled using the proposed method and experimental results verifying the proposed approach.

We consider the discrete placement problem, where the possible locations of the sensors are selected from a discrete set.

The phenomena of time-delays and state-saturations are introduced to better describe insightful engineering. During local measurements transmission between sensors over a resource-limited sensor network, to prevent data collisions and resource-consumption, a newly dynamic event-triggering strategy (DETS) is designed to dispatch the local measurements transmission for each sensor to its neighbors. Compared with the most existing static ETSs, this DETs can mitigate the total number of triggering times and enlarge interval time between consecutive triggering instants. Then, some novel adequate criteria for designing the desired event-based SM estimators are derived such that the plant's true state always resides in each sensor's ellipsoidal region regardless of the simultaneous presence of bounded noises, mixed time delays and state-saturations. Subsequently, a recursive optimization algorithm is formulated such that the minimal ellipsoids, the estimators gains and event-triggering weighted matrices are acquired simultaneously. A verification simulation is presented to illustrate the advantages of the design approach of the developed state estimator. (c) 2021 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

First, a sufficient condition is proposed which indicates that the global optimal effect can be achieved by the fuzzily combined local optimal controllers. Based on this sufficient condition, we derive a local concept approach to designing the optimal fuzzy controller by applying traditional linear optimal control theory, The stability of the entire closed-loop continuous fuzzy system can be ensured by the designed optimal fuzzy controller. The optimal feedback continuous fuzzy system can not only be guaranteed to be exponentially stable, but also be stabilized to any desired degree. Also, the total energy of system output is absolutely finite. Moreover, the resultant feedback continuous fuzzy system possesses an infinite gain margin; that is, its stability is guaranteed no matter how large the feedback gain becomes, Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed optimal fuzzy controller design approach and to demonstrate the proved stability properties.

The current developed model consists of a two-stage approach, and is dedicated to the special case where there are more continuous than batch units. In the first stage, all batch units are treated as continuous units by using auxiliary water storage tanks, and a continuously operated IPWN is synthesized to minimize the fresh water consumption. Subject to the determined IPWN flow rates, the water storage policy for the batch units is determined in the second stage to minimize the total storage capacity. Alternatively, the formulations of both stages can be combined and solved simultaneously to minimize the IPWN cost. Two modified literature examples are used to illustrate the proposed approach.

These reactors can effectively operate with a wide range of biomass mixtures. Therefore, it is imperative to carefully design the gas distributor plate and solid tube inlet to ensure stable fluidization and uniform distribution of fluidizing gas and solid particles within the reactor. This study investigated the impact of gas-solid feeder design in bubbling fluidized bed gasifier for biomass mixtures on system hydrodynamics, employing a computational fluid dynamics-artificial neural network (CFD-ANN) coupling model to achieve more realistic simulations. A 2(k) factorial experimental design was adopted to inquire the impact of gas and solid feeding systems. The responses under investigation included the gas-solid mixing index and the solid residence time, both of which hold pivotal roles in specific chemical processes related to biomass utilization in fluidized bed technology. All cases were successfully simulated, and the results uncovered that the position and length of the solid inlet tube wielded a significant influence on reactor performance, particularly concerning solid residence time. Furthermore, the designs of the gas distributor were identified as critical factors capable of enhancing system turbulence and mixing. In summary, the results showed the potential for enhancing reactor performance through the optimization of gas-solid feeding systems and underscored the efficacy of the ANN drag model in simulating continuous biomass gasification systems.																			0008-4034	1939-019X				2024 MAR 18	2024										10.1002/cjce.25243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cjce.25243		MAR 2024											WOS:001186707000001
J	Sun, YL; El-Farra, NH				Sun, Yulei; El-Farra, Nael H.			Resource aware quasi-decentralized control of networked process systems over wireless sensor networks	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												This paper develops an integrated model-based networked control and scheduling framework for plants with interconnected units and distributed control systems that exchange information using a resource-constrained wireless sensor network (WSN). The framework aims to enforce closed-loop stability while simultaneously minimizing the rate at which each node in the WSN must collect and transmit measurements. Initially, the exchange of information between the local control systems is reduced by embedding, within each control system, dynamic models that provide forecasts of the evolution of the plant units when measurements are not transmitted through the WSN, and updating the state of each model when communication is re-established at discrete time instances. To further reduce WSN utilization, only a subset of the deployed sensor suites are allowed to transmit their data at any given time to provide updates to their target models according to a certain scheduling strategy. By formulating the networked closed-loop plant as a combined discrete-continuous system, explicit characterizations of both the stability and performance properties of the networked closed-loop system under state and output feedback control are obtained in terms of the communication rate, the sensor transmission schedule, the accuracy of the models, as well as the controller and observer design parameters. The results are illustrated using a chemical plant example where it is shown that by judicious management of the interplays between the control, communication and scheduling design parameters, it is possible to enhance the savings in WSN resource utilization beyond what is possible with concurrent transmission configurations.

J	Yang, X; He, HB				Yang, Xiong; He, Haibo			Adaptive Critic Designs for Event-Triggered Robust Control of Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Dynamics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS												This paper develops a novel event-triggered robust control strategy for continuous-time nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics. To begin with, the event-triggered robust nonlinear control problem is transformed into an event-triggered nonlinear optimal control problem by introducing an infinite-horizon integral cost for the nominal system. Then, a recurrent neural network (RNN) and adaptive critic designs (ACDs) arc employed to solve the derived event-triggered nonlinear optimal control problem. The RNN is applied to reconstruct the system dynamics based on collected system data. After acquiring the knowledge of system dynamics, a unique critic network is proposed to obtain the approximate solution of the event-triggered Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation within the framework of ACDs. The critic network is updated by using simultaneously historical and instantaneous state data. An advantage of the present critic network update law is that it can relax the persistence of excitation condition. Meanwhile, under a newly developed event-triggering condition, the proposed critic network tuning rule not only guarantees the critic network weights to converge to optimums but also ensures nominal system states to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, by using Lyapunov method, it is proved that the derived optimal event-triggered control (ETC) guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all the signals in the original system. Finally, a nonlinear oscillator and an unstable power system are provided to validate the developed robust ETC scheme.

The geometrical information on the traffic network is characterized by a hybrid Petri net (HPN). Then, the algebraic behavior of the traffic flow is transformed into a mixed logical dynamical system (MLDS) form to introduce an,optimization technique. These expressions involve both a continuous evolution of the traffic flow and an event-driven behavior of the traffic light. The HPN allows us to easily formulate the problem for a complicated and large-scale traffic network due to its graphical understanding. The MLDS enables us to optimize the control,policy for a traffic light by means of its algebraic manipulability and use of the model predictive control framework. Since the behavior represented by the HPN can be directly transformed into the corresponding MLDS form, the seamless incorporation of two different modeling schemes provides a systematic design scenario for traffic flow control.																			1083-4427	1558-2426				MAR	2008	38	2					346	357		10.1109/TSMCA.2007.914779	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2007.914779													WOS:000253601900008

A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an exponential stabilizing transition probability matrix is derived by means of a mode-dependent parametric approach. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is established for the above-mentioned hybrid design with a specified lower bound on the decay rate. The proposed design approaches can be applied to solve two kinds of control design problems with practical constraints imposed on the hybrid design. Besides, an estimation approach is proposed on the decay rate and decay coefficient of the jump systems. Also, two optimization problems are formulated to obtain the hybrid control strategy. Finally, two numerical examples and a network-on-chip based application are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

Philip			Neural Approximation-Based Adaptive Control for a Class of Nonlinear Nonstrict Feedback Discrete-Time Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												In this paper, an adaptive control approach-based neural approximation is developed for a class of uncertain nonlinear discrete-time (DT) systems. The main characteristic of the considered systems is that they can be viewed as a class of multi-input multioutput systems in the nonstrict feedback structure. The similar control problem of this class of systems has been addressed in the past, but it focused on the continuous-time systems. Due to the complicacies of the system structure, it will become more difficult for the controller design and the stability analysis. To stabilize this class of systems, a new recursive procedure is developed, and the effect caused by the noncausal problem in the nonstrict feedback DT structure can be solved using a semirecurrent neural approximation. Based on the Lyapunov difference approach, it is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobal, ultimately uniformly bounded, and a good tracking performance can be guaranteed. The feasibility of the proposed controllers can be validated by setting a simulation example.					Li, Shu/AAT-1778-2021; Liu, Yan-Jun/H-6371-2011; 刘, 严君/GZL-5764-2022; Chen, C. L.

J	Uykan, Z				Uykan, Zekeriya			On the Working Principle of the Hopfield Neural Networks and its Equivalence to the GADIA in Optimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												Hopfield neural networks (HNNs) are one of the most well-known and widely used kinds of neural networks in optimization. In this article, the author focuses on building a deeper understanding of the working principle of the HNN during an optimization process. Our investigations yield several novel results giving some important insights into the working principle of both continuous and discrete HNNs. This article shows that what the traditional HNN actually does as energy function decreases is to divide the neurons into two classes in such a way that the sum of biased class volumes is minimized (or maximized) regardless of the types of the optimization problems. Introducing neuron-specific class labels, the author concludes that the traditional discrete HNN is actually a special case of the greedy asynchronous distributed interference avoidance algorithm (GADIA) [17] of Babadi and Tarokh for the 2-class optimization problems. The computer results confirm the findings.

Firstly, a fractional integral sliding surface which is suitable for the considered FO error system is proposed. Secondly, in terms of the established sliding surface, combining a novel reaching law, a new adaptive sliding mode control law is introduced, which can force the closed-loop dynamic error system trajectories to reach the sliding surface. Then, a continuous frequency distributed model of the FO dynamic networks is given, via the application of FO system stability theory and robust control, the projective synchronization conditions are addressed in terms of linear matrix inequality techniques. Based on the conditions, a desired controller which can guarantee the robust stability of the closed-loop system and also ensure a mixed /passive performance level is designed.

J	Huo, ZY; Zhao, L; Yin, HC; Ye, JX				Huo Zhaoyi; Zhao Liang; Yin Hongchao; Ye Jianxiong			Simultaneous synthesis of structural-constrained heat exchanger networks with and without stream splits	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This paper presents a comprehensive simultaneous synthesis approach based on stage-wise superstructure to design cost-optimal heat exchanger network (HEN). It is well known that the simultaneous synthesis model has very complicated mixed integer nonlinear programming formulations, which are non-convex, non-continuous and have many local optima. Up till now, it cannot be expected that an algorithm can find, in polynomial time, the global solution to the simultaneous synthesis problem of HEN. In order to reduce computational complexity, some simplified assumptions for structures, such as no stream splits, stream splits with isothermal mixing, no stream split flowing through more than one exchanger, etc, are adopted to prune the search space at the expense of neglecting certain important alternatives in the network configuration. In this work, a flexible stage-wise superstructure is proposed to control the solution performance and search space efficiently. At each stage of the superstructure, with or without stream splits is determined at random or by the experience of designers. In this way, various candidate series and split network designs featuring the lowest annual cost can be found. Moreover, an efficient two-level optimisation algorithm is employed for solving the presented model utilising genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimisation algorithm. Three case studies are presented to show the applicability of the proposed methodology. In addition, the results show that the new approach is able to find more economical networks than those generated by other methods.

Intelligent algorithms in the design and optimization of metamaterial aremuch more efficient than manual design when the massive trial and error are inevitable. In recent years, the bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm has attracted much attention because of its good performance on expensive electromagnetic simulation problems. Since BO is limit to continuous problems, we propose the compression mapping method to transform the discrete problem into a continuous problem and successfully apply the BO to the design of the topological structure of the metamaterial unit. We design a double-layer structure topology configuration frequency selection surface(FSS) to verify the effectiveness of the proposedmethod. Compared with some other intelligent algorithms, such as heuristic algorithm and neural network algorithm, BO aims to obtain a better result through less electromagnetic simulation times, which greatly shortens the time cost. Consequently, for the application of intelligent algorithms to design metamaterials, we provide a new idea and method to find an metamaterial structure in a relatively short period of time.																					978-1-7281-7247-7				2021							1768	1775																WOS:000795902300292

First, we consider the discrete event-triggered (ET) scheme to make efficient utilisation of bandwidth. Under this ET-scheme, sensor releases the data only when our sampled-data plant violates the specific event-triggered condition. Second, the T-S fuzzy system is used to model the non-linear NCSs. Another purpose of this paper is to design filters involving delays. Such filters have a more general form than the delay-free filters that have been mostly considered in the traditional studies. By using the time-delay system, co-design of event-triggered scheme and H filter for the delayed NCSs is presented in a unified frame work. To choose the latest data packet and discard the dis-ordered packet logic, zero-order hold is inserted between the fuzzy filter and event generator. Then, by using the novel fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii function approach with free-weighting matrix technique, H filter design of event-triggered delay NCSs is proposed. Finally, to show the effective result of our co-design method, a tunnel-diode example is given.

The continuous bounded inequality is converted into equality by introducing a time-variant nonnegative vector. A continuous zeroing neural network (CZNN) model is proposed for solving the corresponding continuous DLLEBI by utilizing the ZNN method. Adams-Bashforth (AB) methods are combined with the CZNN model to improve the computational precision. Hence, AB discrete ZNN (AB-DZNN) models are proposed to solve future DLLEBI. Specifically, a four-step AB-DZNN model with high precision is proposed. Three-, two-, and one-step AB-DZNN models are also developed for comparative analyses. Theoretical analyses and numerical results substantiate the validity and superiority of the proposed four-step AB-DZNN model for solving future DLLEBI. In addition, motion control problems of three-link, mobile, and physical Kinova JACO2 robot arms are formulated as three specific future DLLEBI problems. These problems can be solved by the four proposed AB-DZNN models. Comparative numerical results provide further evidence that the proposed four-step AB-DZNN model has the most superior computational performance among the four AB-DZNN models.

Optimal mix of solar and wind distributed generations considering performance improvement of electrical distribution network	RENEWABLE ENERGY												Renewable energy sources are gaining more and more interest because they are nonpolluting and sustainable. Recently, a notable number of renewable distributed generations (DGs) having intermittent generation patterns are being interconnected with the distribution network to meet growing load demand and nullify environmental threats. Appropriate integration of renewable DGs in distribution networks is crucial to guarantee the qualitative network operational benefits. In this paper a simple but efficient approach has been proposed for optimal placement and sizing of solar and wind DGs in distribution territory by considering electrical network power loss minimization, voltage stability and network security improvement. The stochastic nature of solar irradiance and wind speed are accounted using suitable probabilistic models. Weighted aggregation particle swarm optimization technique is employed to optimize the objective functions considering bus voltage limit, line loading capacity, discrete size limit and penetration constraints of DGs. Strategic weight selection technique has been adopted to assess the well trade-off solution by persuasion of multiple objectives regarding the performance of distribution network. The proposed method has been applied to a typical Indian rural distribution network, and the satisfactory results are obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the finite-time stability theory, Lyapunov stability theory, the concept of Filippov solution and the differential inclusion theory, some useful finite-/fixed-time synchronization sufficient conditions for the considered Cohen-Grossberg neural networks are established by designing two kinds of novel periodically switching controllers. Instead of using uninterrupted high control strength, the periodically switching controller in each period is used with high strength control in one stage and weak strength in the other. It can overcome the effects caused by the uncertainties of Filippov solution induced by discontinuous neuron activation functions and reduce the control cost. Besides, the period switching control rate is closely related to the settling time T.

The environmental impact is evaluated via benchmarking. By using benchmarking, the decision maker could obtain insight not only into the environmental impact of a certain design belonging to the Pareto optimal solutions, but also into the competitiveness of the design within a particular production sector. The economic criterion used is the total cost of the water network and involves the freshwater cost, annual investment costs of the storage tank, piping and local treatment unit installation, and wastewater treatment cost. This approach uses a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that enables water re-use and regeneration re-use in batch and semi-continuous processes. The Pareto front is generated using the Normal-Boundary Intersection (NBI) method.

How to evaluate an image comprehensively has become the focus of recent researches. The traditional image aesthetic assessment methods often adopt single numerical overall assessment scores, which has certain subjectivity and can no longer meet the higher aesthetic requirements. In this article, we construct an new image attribute dataset called aesthetic mixed dataset with attributes (AMD-A) and design external attribute features for fusion. Besides, we propose an efficient method for image aesthetic attribute assessment on mixed multi-attribute dataset and construct a multitasking network architecture by using the EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone network. Our model can achieve aesthetic classification, overall scoring, and attribute scoring. In each sub-network, we improve the feature extraction through ECA channel attention module. As for the final overall scoring, we adopt the idea of the teacher-student network and use the classification sub-network to guide the aesthetic overall fine-grain regression. Experimental results, using the MindSpore, show that our proposed method can effectively improve the performance of the aesthetic overall and attribute assessment.					lou, hao/JKI-8455-2023; Jin, Xin/S-9172-2017; Singh, Amit Kumar/D-1300-2015	Singh, Amit Kumar/0000-0001-7359-2068													1551-6857	1551-6865				OCT	2022	18	3		S	SI				138	10.1145/3547144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3547144													WOS:000951829800008

This continuous growth and the increasing demand in the provision of high transmission rate, delay sensitive and spectrum efficient cellular networks have made the development of fifth generation (5G) networks a reality. The design of the end-to-end 5G networks anticipated the need for terrestrial radio access networks to be complemented by its satellite counterpart in order to ensure that 5G services are provided seamlessly. These 5G services include IoT communications. This has necessitated the need for 5G satellite radio access networks to provide access to IoT devices that are located in remote and rural areas. This type of IoT devices are termed Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) devices. While this remain an appealing solution, many radio resource management issues including packet scheduling for IoRT communications in 5G satellite networks remains undefined. Hence, this paper aims to propose a new dynamic packet scheduling algorithm that will be appropriate for mixed traffic type IoRT communications in 5G satellite networks. The performance evaluation of the proposed packet scheduler is conducted through simulations, using delay, spectral efficiency, throughput and fairness index as the performance indices.																					978-1-7281-6362-8				2020										10.1109/icacce49060.2020.9154993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icacce49060.2020.9154993													WOS:000621388100013

This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder, and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations of molecules allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of drug-like molecules and also in a set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms.

J	Dai, H; Li, YC; Shen, GX				Dai, Hua; Li, Yongcheng; Shen, Gangxiang			Explore Maximal Potential Capacity of WDM Optical Networks Using Time Domain Hybrid Modulation Technique	JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY												The recent emerging time domain hybrid modulation (TDHM) technique is considered promising because it can realize continuous adaptation between spectral efficiency and transparent reach through appropriately allocating the time slot occupancy ratios of different modulation formats in a time-division multiplexing (TDM) frame. This technique is expected to achieve more efficient spectrum utilization or higher transmission capacity than the traditional transmission technique based on discrete modulation formats. For the point-to-point transmission system, the benefit of the TDHM technique has been experimentally verified. However, its benefit from the whole network perspective has not been explored yet. In this paper, we apply the TDHM technique to the optical network to maximize its transmission capacity. To evaluate the benefit of this technique, we consider the routing and wavelength assignment problem for the TDHM-based WDM network, for which we develop an integer linear programming model and a waveplane-based heuristic algorithm to maximize the total network transmission capacity for the cases with and without network protection. For the protection case, the shared backup path protection technique is employed owing to its efficiency of spare capacity sharing and simplicity in network operation. The simulation study shows that compared to the design with discrete modulation formats, the TDHM-based approach can significantly increase the network transmission capacity.

The radon monitor consists of a customised discrete automatic sampler which produces a gas flux circuit, and an economical a-scintillation cell, coupled with a reliable electronics-photomultiplier assemblage. A convenient calibration system together with a temporised control system have been set up. The overall "mean efficiency" of the system was calculated to be 7.79 +/- 0.13 counts per minute (cpm) for each Bq/L. Taking into consideration the present and future requirements of a geochemical surveillance network to assess natural hazards, the prototype design evolved from the study of existing systems devoted to monitor radon concentration levels, which are critically reviewed within this paper. In response to the main prerequisite of a remote station: maximum remote sensor versatility preserving shared software and hardware for the network as a whole, this radon monitoring system was conceived as part of a multi-parametric Geochemical Monitoring System (GMS II) prototype, designed and realised as a test-stand for sensors (chemical, hydrological, geophysical, organic chemistry devoted, etc.) in continuous evolution throughout the international market.

However, their discrete nature prevents them from representing continuous and fine geometry, posing a major issue for learning-based shape generation. In this work, we turn the discrete point sets into smooth surfaces by introducing the well-known implicit moving least-squares (IMLS) surface formulation, which naturally defines locally implicit functions on point sets. We incorporate IMLS surface generation into deep neural networks for inheriting both the flexibility of point sets and the high quality of implicit surfaces. Our IMLSNet predicts an octree structure as a scaffold for generating MLS points where needed and characterizes shape geometry with learned local priors. Furthermore, our implicit function evaluation is independent of the neural network once the MLS points are predicted, thus enabling fast runtime evaluation. Our experiments on 3D object reconstruction demonstrate that IMLSNets outperform state-of-the-art learning-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. Extensive ablation tests also validate our network design and loss functions.

These vehicles were primarily meant to facilitate human transportation in places like large universities. The idea was to design economical networks using the already existing infrastructure, when delays can be tolerated. The salient feature of these networks is that the wireless server does not stop, rather provides the service to the users while on the move and as long as the contact is available. Thus the service of various users waiting on such networks is interlinked. One cannot model this system with existing continuous/discrete polling models, as the later assume the server to stop and serve before resuming with its journey. We obtain the conditions for stability and then the workload analysis. We also discuss optimal scheduling policies.

This paper focuses on reducing the long-term energy consumption of a cell-free network in the downlink integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) for achieving energy sustainability. The resultant design includes both the AP classification on a large time-scale and the beamforming of the APs on a small time-scale in order to simultaneously satisfy the IDET requirements of data users and energy users. For dealing with binary integer actions (AP classification) and continuous actions (beamforming) together, we innovatively propose a stable double parameterized deep-Q-network (DP-DQN), which can be enhanced by a digital twin (DT) running in the intelligent core processor (ICP) so as to achieve faster and more stable convergence. Therefore, the cell-free network may avoid suffering from performance fluctuation during the training process. The simulation results demonstrate that our DP-DQN exceeds in convergence compared to other benchmarks while guaranteeing an optimal solution.

In IIoT deployments, wireless links are increasingly used in improving the operational connectivity for industrial data services, such as collecting massive process data, communicating with industrial robots, and tracking machines/parts/products on the factory floor and beyond. Wireless system design for IIoT applications is inherently a joint effort among operational technology (OT) engineers, information technology (IT) system architects, and wireless network planners. In this paper, we propose a new reference framework for wireless system design in IIoT use cases. The framework presents a generic design process and identifies the key questions and tools of individual procedures. Specifically, we extract impact factors from distinct domains including industrial operations and environments, data service dynamics, and the IT infrastructure. We then map these factors into function clusters and discuss their respective impact on performance metrics and resource utilization strategies. Finally, discussions take place in four exemplary IIoT applications where we use the framework to identify wireless network issues and deployment features in the continuous process monitoring, discrete system control, mobile applications, and spectrum harmonization, respectively. The goals of this paper are twofold: 1) to assist OT engineers to better recognize wireless communication demands and challenges in their plants and 2) to help industrial IT specialists to come up with operative and efficient end-to-end wireless solutions to meet demanding needs in factory environments.

J	Tymoshchuk, P				Tymoshchuk, Pavlo			Neural network optimal control for discrete-time nonlinear systems with known internal dynamics	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS												A neural network (NN) optimal control for discrete-time nonlinear dynamic systems with known internal dynamics is designed. The control is described by an algebraic equation with a variable structure. This algebraic equation is derived analytically. A functional block diagram of the controlled system is given and analyzed. Software and hardware implementation aspects of the controller are discussed. The controller does not need any training and has moderate complexity. The discrete-time state variable trajectories of the controlled system are shown to be globally asymptotically stable and convergent to unique steady states. It is proved that these trajectories converge to steady-state neighborhood in a finite number of steps. Sliding mode analysis of controller operation is fulfilled. A correctness of controller operation in the case of disturbances of its nonlinearities is analyzed. Using the controller for a special case of optimal tracking control is discussed. Results of presented computer simulations of optimal control of discrete-time two-dimensional and three-dimensional affine nonlinear systems and optimal tracking control of permanent-magnet motor of linear type applied for accurate positioning and nonlinear cooling continuous stirred tank reactor confirm theoretical statements of the paper and illustrate a performance of the controller.

J	Song, PT; Yang, QY; Wen, GR; Zhang, ZF				Song, Pengtao; Yang, Qingyu; Wen, Guangrui; Zhang, Zhifen			Observer-based output feedback control for networked systems with dual-channel event-triggered sampling and quantization	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												This paper investigates the problem of observer-based output feedback control for linear networked systems with dual-channel event-triggered mechanisms and quantization. Both continuous-time and discrete-time event detection cases are discussed. In the continuous-time case, the stability of observer error dynamics and closed-loop system are analyzed respectively, and it is proved that Zeno behavior would not occur. In order to approach engineering practice, in the discrete-time case, two types of network attacks including denial-of-service (DoS) and fault data injection (FDI) attacks are considered, whose nature property is characterized by Bernoulli variables. By combining these factors and transmission delay, a novel augmented system model is proposed, and some sufficient conditions are derived based on Lyapunov functional approach and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Compared with the existing results, this framework is more comprehensive and practical, and the global uniform ultimate boundedness of closed-loop systems can be guaranteed. Finally, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hajibabai, L; Saha, D				Hajibabai, Leila; Saha, Debashis			Patrol Route Planning for Incident Response Vehicles under Dispatching Station Scenarios	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING												Traffic incidents often contribute to major safety concerns, impose additional congestion in the neighboring transportation networks, and induce indirect costs to economy. As roughly a third of traffic crashes are secondary accidents, effective incident management activities are critical, especially on roadways with high traffic volume, to detect, respond to, and clean up incidents in a timely fashion, which supports safety constraints and restores traffic capacity in the transportation network. Hence, it is beneficial to simultaneously plan for first respondents' dispatching station location and patrol route design to mitigate congestion. This article presents an optimal route planning for patrolling vehicles to facilitate quick response to potential accidents. A mixed-integer nonlinear program is proposed that minimizes the respondents' patrolling travel cost based on the expected maximum response time from each arbitrary location to all incident locations (a.k.a. hotspots) with various incident occurrence probabilities. We have developed a column generation-based solution technique to solve the route optimization model under different station design scenarios. To investigate the impact of dispatching station design on the routing cost, an integrated genetic algorithm framework with embedded continuous approximation approach is developed that reduces the complexity of the hybrid location design and route planning problem. Numerical experiments on hypothetical networks of various sizes are conducted to indicate the performance of the proposed algorithm and to draw managerial insights. The models and solution techniques, developed in this article, are applicable to a number of network problems that simultaneously involve routing and facility location choices.

Integrated process design, scheduling, and model predictive control of batch processes with closed-loop implementation	AICHE JOURNAL												Simultaneous evaluation of multiple time scale decisions has been regarded as a promising avenue to increase the process efficiency and profitability through leveraging their synergistic interactions. Feasibility of such an integral approach is essential to establish a guarantee for operability of the derived decisions. In this study, we present a modeling methodology to integrate process design, scheduling, and advanced control decisions with a single mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) formulation while providing certificates of operability for the closed-loop implementation. We use multi-parametric programming to derive explicit expressions for the model predictive control strategy, which is embedded into the MIDO using the base-2 numeral system that enhances the computational tractability of the integrated problem by exponentially reducing the required number of binary variables. Moreover, we apply the State Equipment Network representation within the MIDO to systematically evaluate the scheduling decisions. The proposed framework is illustrated with two batch processes with different complexities.

This study introduces a novel approach utilizing a Graph Neural Network-based Simulator (GNS) integrated with an inverse design for optimizing Discrete Element Method (DEM) parameters in granular flow simulations. The GNS model, trained on data sets generated from high-fidelity DEM simulations, exhibits enhanced predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities across various materials and granular collapse scenarios. Methodologically, the study contrasts the GNS approach with conventional Design of Experiment (DoE) methods, highlighting its enhanced computational efficiency and dynamic optimization capacity for complex parameter interactions in granular flows.

The CLSCN design problem is becoming more and more prominent under the context of Sustainable Development and Circular Economy. Parameters associated with a CLSCN including customer demands, transportation costs, or disposal rates are usually subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, natural or man-made disruptions may cause part of the CLSCN to malfunction. We herein propose a hybrid stochastic and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach to hedge against discrete disruption scenarios and uncertain customer demands. We also tailor a Benders decomposition-based algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting large-scale mixed integer linear programming reformulations. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can outperform commercial solvers such as CPLEX, and the DRO approach can produce solutions with low average costs and low variance in out-of-sample tests.

In particular, convergence speed and communication cost are two of the critical concerns for the design of the seeking algorithms. To achieve fast convergence while saving communication resources, this paper investigates the appointed-time distributed NE seeking problem for networked games under a discrete-time communication scenario. By utilizing the idea of motion planning, a new continuous-time distributed NE seeking algorithm, which ensures convergence to NE at the prescribed time, is proposed based on sampled-data information exchange. Compared with the existing related works, the established algorithm has advantages on both the communication cost and convergence speed (i.e., appointed-time convergence).

However, such initial structures are prone to missing necessary design alternatives and may require simplifying assumptions to ease the computational burden of optimization algorithms. This paper presents a non-structural model (NSM) for synthesis of HEN considering stream splitting and non-isothermal merging of branch streams. The model exhibits randomness in stream matching, generation and elimination by which potential matches are realized. Random walk algorithm with compulsive evolution is used for optimization of both integer variables (number of heat units) and continuous variables (heat duties and split fractions). The effectiveness of the approach is tested for small- and medium-size literature cases. The method demonstrates results comparable to or better than those reported in literature.

The EENet exploits the spatial information in hyperspectral image by a "many to one" strategy, i.e., the abundance of a pixel is combined by the abundances of its adjacent pixels. The idea is based on the assumption: once an endmember is mixed in a pixel, it is mixed in the surrounding pixels with high probability. The strategy promotes a continuous and smooth spatial distribution of abundances, and it is more effective than the other methods for endmember extraction. Besides, to make full use of the rich spectral information and obtain more accurate abundances, we design an AENet, which applies the deep convolutional neural network to estimate the abundances with the endmembers acquired from the EENet. The experiments are conducted on two real datasets, which show the SSAE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

The upper-level subprogram is to maximize the toll revenue collected while explicitly accounting for the toll booth setting up and operating cost, given certain toll level constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a traditional user equilibrium problem with elastic demand.

Then, mixed passive / H-infinity observers are presented to ensure that the actuator bias failure is well estimated.

The development tendency will be towards large-diameter, high-pressure and long-distance for natural gas-pipelines. Correspondingly, the life cycle cost of natural gas-pipeline networks is increasing gradually. The mainline system is a vital part of natural gas network systems. The investment required for the mainline system is enormous, usually accounting for 80% of the total investment for this system. In general, the investment required for a gas-pipeline depends on its operating parameters. Therefore, based on the characteristics of gas networks, optimization for investment becomes indispensable to gas networks design. A comprehensive and optimal mathematic model of a gas networks system is established in this paper which considers all the factors influencing the total investment of a gas networks system (e.g. pipe diameter, thickness. pressure, length, compression ratio, etc). From the standpoint of the characteristics of a model comprising both continuous and discrete variables, a new methodology, rank-optimization, is presented. On the basis of this model, a simple and visual high-pressure networks optimization program has been compiled. Furthermore, the developed optimization program has been applied to a practical project and the effects of operating parameters on the total investment have been analyzed. The simulation model in this paper is shown to be an effective method to solve optimization on mainline system in high-pressure gas networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Robert			Networks of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions modulate the complex folding free energy surface of a designed βα protein	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The successful de novo design of proteins can provide insights into the physical chemical basis of stability, the role of evolution in constraining amino acid sequences, and the production of customizable platforms for engineering applications. Previous guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl; an ionic denaturant) experiments of a designed, naturally occurring beta alpha fold, Di-III_14, revealed a cooperative, two-state unfolding transition and a modest stability. Continuous-flow mixing experiments in our laboratory revealed a simple two-state reaction in the microsecond to millisecond time range and consistent with the thermodynamic results. In striking contrast, the protein remains folded up to 9.25 M in urea, a neutral denaturant, and hydrogen exchange (HDX) NMR analysis in water revealed the presence of numerous high-energy states that inter-convert on a time scale greater than seconds. The complex protection pattern for HDX corresponds closely with a pair of electrostatic networks on the surface and an extensive network of hydrophobic side chains in the interior of the protein. Mutational analysis showed that electrostatic and hydrophobic networks contribute to the resistance to urea denaturation for the WT protein; remarkably, single charge reversals on the protein surface restore the expected urea sensitivity. The roughness of the energy surface reflects the densely packed hydrophobic core; the removal of only two methyl groups eliminates the high-energy states and creates a smooth surface. The design of a very stable beta alpha fold containing electrostatic and hydrophobic networks has created a complex energy surface rarely observed in natural proteins.

The neural networks are designed to adapt on-line to changing system structures, parameter values and sampling periods. To achieve this objective, the network weighting coefficients are determined during an off-line training phase. In this training phase, the optimal values of the FROH parameter are obtained by applying the classical generalized root locus procedure.

Quantum evolutionary computing is a relatively recent spot-lighted concept which takes advantage from both the evolutionary and quantum computing laws. In general, QIEAs have been proven to be really powerful for optimising complex engineering tasks. The fascinating trait of observation operator in QIEA enables us to transform the quantum bits to both the binary and continuous spaces. Here, the authors present a mix continuous/binary version of QIEA, to find out whether it is suited for designing regularised EELMs. Indeed, the design process of EELM is conducted at two different levels, i.e. hyper and low levels. At the low level, some novel criteria are presented in the form of penalty functions to enable the optimiser searching for parsimonious, compact and accurate regularised extreme learning machines, as individual components of the ensemble. At the hyper-level, the non-negative least square error optimisation technique is utilised to deterministically find the most eligible components for designing the ensemble. Through extensive numerical experiments, the authors demonstrate that the proposed method is really efficient for the automated design of EELM identifiers.

However, current 3D printing methods cannot produce continuous gradients from multiple materials. Here, low-loss graded dielectrics via active mixing of nanocomposite inks composed of block copolymers and oxide nanoparticles are designed and printed. By simultaneously tailoring their rheological, printing, and their local filler particle-to-polymer ratio using an active mixing printhead, a conductive microstrip-graded substrate matching network with a gradually changing dielectric response, is created. In these printed devices, the impedance of the RF signal is controlled by the graded substrate rather than by varying the conductive microstrip geometry, enabling the fabrication of smaller RF devices. This approach enables the rapid design and fabrication of high-performance RF devices with locally tunable dielectric properties.

This allows the storage of contextual information, without a substantial increase in network complexity. We introduce the concept of a complete memory. We then prove mathematically that a network with a complete memory temporal encoding stage followed by a sufficiently powerful feedforward network is capable of approximating arbitrarily well any continuous, causal, time-invariant discrete-time system with a uniformly bounded input domain, The memory mechanisms of the habituation based networks are complete memories, and involve nonlinear transformations of the input signal, In networks such as the time delay neural network (TDNN) [35] and focused gamma networks [8], nonlinearities are present in the feedforward stage only. This distinction is made important by recent theoretical results concerning the limitations of structures with linear temporal encoding stages, Results are reported on classification of high dimensional feature vectors obtained from Banzhaf sonograms.																			0925-2312					JUN	1997	15	3-4					273	307		10.1016/S0925-2312(97)00010-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0925-2312(97)00010-6													WOS:A1997XF18800005

Single-domain networks may contain noisy edges and they may lack some important information. Thus, some authors have proposed to consider the multiple relationships that connect the nodes of a network, thus obtaining multi-domain networks. However, most community detection approaches are limited to multi-layer networks, i.e. networks generated from the superposition of several single-domain networks (called layers) that are regarded as independent of each other. In addition to being computationally expensive, multi-layer approaches might yield inaccurate results because they ignore potential dependencies between layers. This paper proposes a multi-domain discrete-time quantum walks (MDQW) model for multi-domain networks. First, the walking space of network nodes in multi-domain network is constructed. Second, the quantum permutation circuit of the coin state is designed based on the coded particle state. Then, using different coin states, the shift operator performs several quantum walks on the particles. Finally, the corresponding update rule is selected to move the node according to the measurement result of the quantum state. With continuous update iteration, the shift operator automatically optimizes the discovered community structure. We experimentally compared our MDQW method with four state-of-the-art competitors on five real datasets. We used the normalized mutual information (NMI) to compare clustering quality, and we report an increase in NMI of up to 3.51 of our MDQW method in comparison with the second-best performing competitor. The MDQW method is much faster than its competitors, allowing us to conclude that MDQW is a useful tool in the analysis of large real-life multi-domain networks. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of our approach on two real-world case studies.

The designed continuous and discrete mode LQG-based WADC is robust enough to deal with the problem of imperfect communication medium. The imperfect communication medium includes process noise, measurement noise, packet drop-out and signal latency in the remote control signal. The appropriate control input and the controller location are selected using the modal residue method. The imperfections in the communication network are modelled using Pade approximations for time delay and by inserting Gaussian random noise. Using two typical test power systems, the performance of robust LQG-based WADC as a power system stability agent is assessed in the frequency domain and via time-domain simulation of the non-linear model on MATLAB/Simulink and DIgSILENT software platform. Finally, a real-time implementation of the designed WADC is demonstrated on the Opal RT-Lab real-time digital simulator.					senroy, nilanjan/E-2076-2013; Bhadu, Mahendra/AAU-6536-2020; Kar, Indra Narayan/L-1645-2017	Bhadu, Mahendra/0000-0003-3300-4123; Senroy, Nilanjan/0000-0001-7816-3369; Kar, Indra Narayan/0000-0003-0277-1725													1751-8687	1751-8695				APR 21	2016	10	6			SI		1470	1478		10.1049/iet-gtd.2015.1113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-gtd.2015.1113													WOS:000376010800018

Continuous interagent communication is eliminated by communicating information only during events. At the event times, an observer communicates with the neighboring agents to obtain update information. During the interevent intervals, an open-loop estimate is used as a substitute for local feedback. The advantages of our novel approach are that: 1) the amount of communication required can be reduced and determining the event times requires no interagent communication, with the event-triggered condition designed using stability analysis so that bounded consensus is guaranteed; 2) bounded state consensus can be achieved without receiving full-state information from the followers; and 3) the switching sequence of the time-varying network topologies can be arbitrary, since a switching controller is developed based on the common-Lyapunov-function approach to ensure state consensus. Intermittent feedback is present and the dynamics of the time-varying network topologies are discrete, which together prove that Zeno behavior never occurs. The stability of the closed loop is analyzed to guarantee bounded convergence for the designed control methodologies. The results of simulations are presented that demonstrate the efficacy of our novel controllers.

First, the linearization method using the infinite series expansion theorem is given. And the tracking control design problem is solved by appropriate state augment. Secondly, the zero sum differential game strategy is introduced to address the control design problem of uncertain systems with eventtriggered inputs. The actor-critic-disturbance networks framework is used to approximate the optimization of event- triggered controller strategy, optimization costs, and the disturbance strategy, respectively. Due to the consideration of discrete time and continuous time dynamics, we put the impulsive system method to use and choose appropriate Lyapunov functions to prove stability and boundedness, at the same time, there will be no infinite triggering situation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by an example of a practical tractor system with n trailers through simulation compared with another typical design method.																			0925-2312	1872-8286				AUG 28	2024	595								127898	10.1016/j.neucom.2024.127898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2024.127898													WOS:001247516800001

However, the femtocells deployed inside a macrocell coverage are potentially suffered from excessive interference. This paper proposes a novel radio resource optimization in closed access femtocell networks based on bat algorithm. Bat algorithm is inspired by the behavior of bats in their echolocation process. While the original bat algorithm is designed to solve the complex optimization problem in continuous search space, the proposed modified bat algorithm extends the search optimization in a discrete search space which is suitable for radio resource allocation problem. The simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed optimization scheme to the global optimal solution and reveal that the proposed scheme based on modified bat algorithm facilitates the improvement of the femtocell network capacity.

NMSD is a rational behavior adjustment process with stationary link flow pattern being theWardrop user equilibrium. NMSD is able to prevent two behavioral deficiencies suffered by the existing min-cost-oriented models and keep solution invariance. NMSD relaxes the homogeneous user assumption, and the continuous-time NMSD (CNMSD) and discrete-time NMSD (DNMSD) share the same revision protocol. Moreover, CNMSD is Lyapunov-stable. Two numerical examples are conducted. The first one is designed to characterize the NMSD conducted network traffic evolution and test the stability of day-to-day NMSD. The second one aims to explore the impacts of network scale on the stability of route-swaps conducted by pairwise and min-cost-pursed swapping behaviors.

It is considered from the view of energy consensus in this paper. Algebraic graph theory is used to describe topology structure of the wireless sensor networks(WSN). The energy consumption of nodes is analyzed and modeled. A hybrid model is built to describe the process of updating continuous energy state and the process of dynamic, discrete topology of WSN. Considering surplus energy information coupled with control message from base station, consensus algorithm for energy consumption is proposed. Integration analysis of the hybrid system reveals that the surplus energy state of each node converges to energy consumption balance. We evaluate the system with the simulation experience and performance data. The results can be a guideline to design and develop collaborative WSN with energy aware.

The logarithmic quantization scheme is employed in the network-based information communication, and a reset state observer is introduced which is based on the standard one to suppress sensor quantization effects. A Bernoulli processing approach is presented to reset the value of the observer with a random way in continuous-time domain. The resulting reset error system is a class of hybrid system which contains both discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic error dynamics. By the stochastic Lyapunov method, it is derived that the error system under the proposed reset technique is asymptotically stable in the sense of each discrete "reset" time instant, and mean-square stable in the continuous-time domain except those "reset" time instants. The observer and controller gains of the closed-loop systems are obtained via solving linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.																			0278-0046	1557-9948				SEP	2014	61	9					4838	4846		10.1109/TIE.2013.2289870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2289870													WOS:000333467900040

General framework	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING					18th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE-18)	JUN 01-04, 2008	Lyon, FRANCE					In the first part of this series of papers we presented a new network-based continuous-time representation for the short-term scheduling of batch processes, which overcomes numerous shortcomings of existing approaches. In this second part, we discuss how this representation can be extended to address aspects such as: (i) preventive maintenance activities on unary resources (e.g., processing and storage units) that were planned ahead of time; (it) resource-constrained changeover activities on processing and shared storage units; (iii) non-instantaneous resource-constrained material transfer activities; (iv) intermediate deliveries of raw materials and shipments of finished products at predefined times: and (v) scenarios where part of the schedule is fixed because it has been programmed in the previous scheduling horizon. The proposed integrated framework can be used to address a wide variety of process scheduling problems, many of which are intractable with existing tools. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We consider an attacker that may inject recurring signals on both the physical dynamics of the agents and the discrete interactions. We model these attacks as additive unknown inputs with appropriate input signatures and timing characteristics. Using hybrid systems modeling tools, we design a novel hybrid attack monitor and, under reasonable assumptions, show that it is able to detect the considered class of recurrent attacks. Finally, we illustrate the general hybrid attack monitor using a specific finite time convergent observer and show its effectiveness on a simplified model of a cloud-connected network of autonomous vehicles.

A Hybrid Fault Detection and Isolation Strategy for a Network of Unmanned Vehicles in Presence of Large Environmental Disturbances	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY												In this brief, the problem of designing and developing a hybrid fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme for a network of unmanned vehicles (NUVs) that is subject to large environmental disturbances is investigated. The proposed FDI algorithm is a hybrid architecture that is composed of a bank of continuous-time residual generators and a discrete-event system (DES) fault diagnoser. A novel set of residuals is generated so that the DES fault diagnoser empowered by incorporating appropriate combinations of the residuals and their sequential features will robustly detect and isolate faults in the NUVs. Our proposed hybrid FDI algorithm is then applied to actuator fault detection and isolation in a network of quad-rotors. Simulation results demonstrate and validate the performance capabilities of our proposed hybrid FDI algorithm.

The scheduling framework is based on the Resource-Task Network, with the objective function that represents the profit taking into account the net income from production and water-related costs. Because of the bilinear terms appearing in the mass balance equations, the overall formulation is a mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is generally more difficult to solve than a mixed-integer linear program or a nonlinear program. A solution strategy that involves relaxation linearization is therefore developed to facilitate the computation. Two literature examples are used to illustrate the proposed approach.

J	Xu, X; Hou, ZS; Lian, CQ; He, HB				Xu, Xin; Hou, Zhongsheng; Lian, Chuanqiang; He, Haibo			Online Learning Control Using Adaptive Critic Designs With Sparse Kernel Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												In the past decade, adaptive critic designs (ACDs), including heuristic dynamic programming (HDP), dual heuristic programming (DHP), and their action-dependent ones, have been widely studied to realize online learning control of dynamical systems. However, because neural networks with manually designed features are commonly used to deal with continuous state and action spaces, the generalization capability and learning efficiency of previous ACDs still need to be improved. In this paper, a novel framework of ACDs with sparse kernel machines is presented by integrating kernel methods into the critic of ACDs. To improve the generalization capability as well as the computational efficiency of kernel machines, a sparsification method based on the approximately linear dependence analysis is used. Using the sparse kernel machines, two kernel-based ACD algorithms, that is, kernel HDP (KHDP) and kernel DHP (KDHP), are proposed and their performance is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. Because of the representation learning and generalization capability of sparse kernel machines, KHDP and KDHP can obtain much better performance than previous HDP and DHP with manually designed neural networks. Simulation and experimental results of two nonlinear control problems, that is, a continuous-action inverted pendulum problem and a ball and plate control problem, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed kernel ACD methods.

Inverse design of self-oscillatory gels through deep learning	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS												We develop a deep learning architecture for inverse design of a self-oscillating sheet propelled by an embedded chemical reaction. The dynamics of our problems are nonlinear and exhibit chaotic behavior, a challenging setting for existing deep-learning-based inverse design approaches. The aim is to explore data-driven design of soft robots using a novel locomotion mechanism. We train the architecture using a forward model of the locomotion mechanism developed recently by Alben et al. (J Comput Phys 399:108952, 2019). The architecture is shown to successfully map a snapshot of target motions of the gel into geometric and reaction parameters. The final architecture consists of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier for discrete parameters, followed by a stacked MLP regressor (SMLPR) for continuous parameters. Our inverse design setting is unique in that it considers both discrete and continuous outputs, requiring an architecture capable of classification and regression. We are able to recover parameters within 2.87% accuracy. We also compare the simulated motion of the sheets at the recovered parameters. Because the motion has a chaotic quality, our demonstration is able to show quantitative agreement for a small time horizon and qualitative agreement over longer time horizons. We also demonstrate agreement of Lyapunov exponents up to 6.78% accuracy for suitable motions.

Firstly, two novel dynamic output event-triggered control strategies(DOETCS) are proposed for continuous-time PMJSs as well as discrete-time PMJSs, which can reduce the event-triggered frequency and save network resources. Then, by constructing multiple linear copositive Lyapunov functions, two sufficient conditions about positivity and stochastic stability with l(1)-gain performance are presented for the continuous-time closed-loop PMJSs and the discrete-time closed-loop PMJSs. Simultaneously, two desired output feedback l(1) controllers and two DOETCS are also co-designed to stabilize the PMJSs in continuous and discrete cases, respectively. All the conditions obtained in this paper are in the form of linear programming(LP). Further more, the influence of parameters in the novel DOETCS on the event-triggered frequency is investigated in detail in the section of numerical simulation.

In the first application, the monolayers are deposited onto solid supports and the magnetic properties of the networks are evaluated, as the transferred films evolve from a monolayer to a bilayer to multilayers. In the second application, the network monolayers are used to derivatize a surface, providing a seed layer for the subsequent deposition of solid-state metal cyanide molecule-based magnets.

Recently, network studies have attempted to relate individual risks to position in the wider network. Goal: To assess the importance of local and global network structures in assessing the risk of acquiring and transmitting infection. Study Design: An individual-based simulation model was used to construct a variety of potential network structures and track the transmission of infection over time. Logistic and Poisson regression were used to identify which measures of network position influence a person's risk for acquiring and transmitting infection, Results: Measures of local centrality were more important to risk of acquisition, whereas global centrality mattered more to transmission.

The geometrical information on the traffic network is characterized by a Hybrid Petri Net (HPN). Then, the algebraic behavior of traffic flow is transformed into a Mixed Logical Dynamical System (MLDS) in order to introduce an optimization technique. These expressions involve both continuous evolution of traffic flow and event driven behavior of traffic light. HPN allows us to formulate the problem easily for complicated and large-scale traffic network due to its graphical understanding. MLDS enables us to optimize the control policy for traffic light by means of its algebraic manipulability and use of model predictive control framework. Since the behavior represented by HPN can be directly transformed into corresponding MLDS, the seamless incorporation of two different modeling schemes provide a systematic design for traffic flow control.																			1553-572X		978-1-4244-0135-2				2006							1791	+																WOS:000245905003051
J	Cho, H; Easwaran, A				Cho, Hyeonjoong; Easwaran, Arvind			Flow Network Models for Online Scheduling Real-Time Tasks on Multiprocessors	IEEE ACCESS												We consider the flow network model to solve the multiprocessor real-time task scheduling problems. Using the flow network model or its generic form, linear programming (LP) formulation, for the problems is not new. However, the previous works have limitations, for example, that they are classified as offline scheduling techniques since they establish a flow network model or an LP problem considering a very long time interval. In this study, we propose how to construct the flow network model for online scheduling periodic real-time tasks on multiprocessors. Our key idea is to construct the flow network only for the active instances of tasks at the current scheduling time, while guaranteeing the existence of an optimal schedule for the future instances of the tasks. The optimal scheduling is here defined to ensure that all real-time tasks meet their deadlines when the total utilization demand of the given tasks does not exceed the total processing capacity. We then propose the flow network model-based polynomial-time scheduling algorithms. Advantageously, the flow network model allows the task workload to be collected unfairly within a certain time interval without losing the optimality. It thus leads us to designing three unfair-but-optimal scheduling algorithms on both continuous and discrete-time models. Especially, our unfair-but-optimal scheduling algorithm on a discrete-time model is, to the best of our knowledge, the first in the problem domain. We experimentally demonstrate that it significantly alleviates the scheduling overheads, i.e., the reduced number of preemptions with the comparable number of task migrations across processors, in comparison with an existing algorithm on the discrete-time model.

The network systems have a finite number of modes, and the modes may jump from one state to another according to a Markov chain. We are devoted to design a state estimator to estimate the neuron states, through available output measurements, such that the dynamics of the estimation error is globally asymptotically stable in the mean square. From the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, we establish sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of the state estimators. Furthermore, it is shown that the traditional stability analysis issue for delayed neural networks with Markovian chains can be included as a special case of our main results. A simulation shows the usefulness of the derived LMI-based stability conditions.

The ISO operates a market, where generators bid prices at which they are willing to provide power. The ISO makes power generation assignments with the goal of solving the economic dispatch problem and regulating the network frequency. We propose a multirate hybrid algorithm for bidding and market clearing that combines the discrete nature of iterative bidding with the continuous nature of the frequency evolution in the power network. We establish sufficient upper bounds on the interevent times that guarantee that the proposed algorithm asymptotically converges to an equilibrium corresponding to an efficient Nash equilibrium and zero frequency deviation. Our technical analysis builds on the characterization of the robustness properties of the continuous-time version of the bidding update process interconnected with the power network dynamics via the identification of a novel local input-to-state Lyapunov function.

Synchronization of coupled neural networks with infinite-time distributed delays via quantized intermittent pinning control	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS												How to deal with the effect of infinite-time delay and maximize rest width is the main difficulty for intermittent control techniques. This paper considers asymptotic synchronization of coupled neural networks (CNNs) with bounded time-varying discrete delay and infinite-time distributed delay (mixed delays). A quantized intermittent pinning control scheme is designed to save both channel resources and control cost and reduce both the amount of transmitted information and channel blocking. Two weighted integral inequalities are first established to deal with the infinite-time distributed delay. Based on weighted double-integral inequalities, novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals with negative terms are designed, which can reduce the conservativeness of the results. Some sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities are obtained to ensure that the CNNs asymptotically synchronize to an isolated system. Moreover, the relationships between the control width, rest width, and convergence rate are explicitly given. Furthermore, an optimal algorithm is provided to increase the rest width as large as possible. As special cases, the synchronization of the CNNs with quantized pinning control and quantized intermittent control are also considered, respectively. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.

In this paper, we propose a framework to solve the problem of load balancing in DNA. Particularly, the user association in DNAs is optimized to minimize the number of active APs and the network cost in terms of tradeoff between power and load, while ensuring users' quality of service (QoS). In general, such a problem is a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear program in the sense that its continuous relaxation is a non-convex problem. To solve this optimization, we use the standard continuous relaxation method and approximate the relaxed problem by a series of second order cone programs with the aid of successive convex approximation (SCA) framework. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm converges within a few iterations and jointly minimizes the network cost and the number of APs in the network.

The discrete-time nonlinear plant considered in this paper is modeled as a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system with plant rules. The data missing phenomenon is considered in both measurement and performance output signals due to the unreliable nature of communication links. Further, to reduce the network bandwidth utilization, the measurement quantization is also employed for both the outputs before transmitting through the communication channel. Also, additive filter gain fluctuation is taken into account to reflect the imprecision in filter implementation. Stochastic variables obeying the Bernoulli distribution are incorporated in the model description to characterize the random occurrence of parameter uncertainties and data packet dropouts. A set of sufficient conditions assuring the stochastic stability of the filtering error system with mixed H infinity$$ {H}_{\infty } $$ and passivity performance is derived according to Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, three numerical examples including mass-spring-damper and tunnel diode circuit model are established to establish the validity of the developed filter design algorithm.

We are interested in flow in discrete fracture networks, which explicitly represent flow in fracture surfaces, but ignore the impact of the surrounding host rock. Fracture networks, generated from observations or stochastic simulations, will contain intersections of arbitrary length, and intersection lines can further cross, forming a highly complex geometry. As the flow exchange between fractures, thus in the network, takes place in these intersections, an adequate representation of the geometry is critical for simulation accuracy. In practice, the intersection dynamics must be handled by a combination of the simulation grid, which may or may not resolve the intersection lines, and the numerical methods applied on the grid. In this work, we review different classes of numerical approaches proposed in recent years, covering both methods that conform to the grid, and non-matching cases. Specific methods considered herein include finite elements, mixed and virtual elements and control volume methods. We expose our methods to an extensive set of test cases, ranging from artificial geometries designed to test difficult configurations, to a network extruded from a real fracture outcrop. The main outcome is guidances for choice of simulation models and numerical discretization with a trade off on the computational cost and solution accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, two recurrent neural dynamics (RND) methods in a continuous-time manner (termed as CTRND) and a discrete-time manner (termed as DTRND) are proposed for handling the continuous-form time-variant ASLS (CF-TV-ASLS) and discrete-form time-variant ASLS (DF-TV-ASLS), respectively. Specifically, first of all, aided with the Kronecker product and vectorization techniques, the CF-TV-ASLS is finally transformed into a continuous-form time-variant matrix-vector equation (CF-TV-MVE) by introducing an additional time-variant nonnegative variable. Analogously, the corresponding DF-TV-ASLS is transformed into a discrete-form time-variant matrix-vector equation (DF-TV-MVE). Whereafter, by exploiting the RND design formula, the CTRND method and DTRND method are proposed and investigated for solving obtained CF-TV-MVE and DF-TV-MVE, respectively. In addition, theoretical analyses about the convergence of CTRND method and DTRND method are presented. Finally, the instructive experiments, including a continuous-time example and a corresponding discrete-time one, substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed CTRND method and DTRND method.

The fault existing in the system is assumed to be characterized by an external system, which incorporates the fault's prior knowledge to the considered systems. The fault estimator is designed by using the multiple Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and average dwell-time approach. Sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are developed to ensure the resulting error system is exponentially stable with an optimized H disturbance attenuation level. The gain matrices of the estimator can be easily determined by using the standard optimization toolboxes.

In prior art, design and analysis of observer based current controllers has been performed either in z-domain taking a discrete approximation of the LCL filter or in continuous-time but with the observer discretized for digital implementation; both methods introduce significant modelling error in the high frequency range. We use a continuous-time equivalent of the discrete observer and develop a comprehensive model of the VSC including the effects of discretization, controller delay, and PWM process. Leveraging the model, we propose a dual-loop current controller with an inner admittance shaping loop that achieves internal stability of the VSC by damping the LCL resonance without the need for additional sensors; moreover, passive converter admittance is achieved almost up to the Nyquist frequency which provides sufficient condition for stability for any uncertain network impedance that may lead to harmonic resonance within that frequency range. The resonance damping capability of the proposed controller is validated through hardware experiments.

A distributed detection framework is managed for different energy, accuracy and time requirements. The design variables include sensor thresholds, fusion rule, sensor selection and sensor mode selection. Different sensors are associated with different transaction times. Hence, varying sensor modes can affect the accuracy and energy consumption. Once the sensors and their modes are selected, the accuracy achieved by this subset of sensors is maximized by managing the thresholds and the fusion rule. Risk, time and energy are the three objectives that the system attempts to minimize. The three objectives are tied into a single objective function by weighting them. A hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm is design the system. The algorithm is a hybrid of continuous, discrete and binary particle swarm. The continuous particle swarm is used to manage the thresholds. The binary particle swarm is used to manage the fusion rule. The discrete particle swarm is used to select the sensors and the sensor mode. The system is adapted for different threat levels that depend on the a priori of imposter in the network. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting the system to different requirements under different threat situations.																			1932-8184	1937-9234				DEC	2009	3	4					389	397		10.1109/JSYST.2009.2039096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2009.2039096													WOS:000274019100002

The mixed delays include time-varying transmission delay, bounded time-varying distributed delay, and discrete constant delay in the leakage term. By using the contraction mapping theorem, we obtain a sufficient condition to guarantee the global existence and uniqueness of the solution for the addressed neural networks. In addition, a delay-independent sufficient condition for existence of an equilibrium point and some delay-dependent sufficient conditions for stability are derived, respectively, by using topological degree theory and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method. The presented results require neither the boundedness, monotonicity, and differentiability of the activation functions nor the differentiability (even differential boundedness) of time-varying delays. Moreover, the proposed stability criteria are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI), which can be conveniently checked by the MATLAB toolbox.

J	Chen, P; Nie, Y				Chen, Peng (Will); Nie, Yu (Marco)			Connecting e-hailing to mass transit platform: Analysis of relative spatial position	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												This paper analyzes and compares two different relative spatial position (RSP) designs in an integrated e-hailingifixed-route transit system: a zone-based design that operates e-hailing vehicles within a zone, and a line-based design that operates e-hailing vehicles along a fixed-route transit line and with a stable headway. To conduct a meaningful comparison, the optimal design problems for both systems are formulated using a same analytical framework based on the continuous approximation approach. A comprehensive numerical experiment is performed to compare various cost components corresponding to the optimal designs, and a discrete-event simulation model is developed to validate the analysis. The analytical and simulation results agree with each other well, with a discrepancy in the total system cost less than 5% in most test scenarios. These results also suggest that the line-based system consistently outperforms the zone-based system in terms of both agency and user costs, for all scenarios tested. Compared to the zone-based design, the line-based design features a sparser fixed-route network (resulting in larger stop spacing) but a higher dispatching frequency. It is concluded that the higher efficiency of the line-based design is likely derived from the strategy of operating e-hailing vehicles with a more regular route/headway structure and allowing ride-sharing.

The continuous-time ZD (CTZD) model based on an exponent-type design formula can be guaranteed to exponentially converge to the time-varying solution set of the problem in an error-free manner. For potential hardware implementation on digital circuits, the corresponding discrete-time ZD (DTZD) model is generated through the well-known Euler forward difference rule. Newton-type algorithm is also developed for comparison purposes. In addition, the simplified CTZD (S-CTZD) and DTZD (S-DTZD) models are developed for solving static scalar-valued nonlinear inequalities. Numerical simulative examples further demonstrate and verify the efficacy of the ZD models for solving time-varying and static scalar-valued nonlinear inequalities. Besides, the DTZD model possesses the lower complexity and higher accuracy, as compared with the Newton-type algorithm.

Two forms of malicious attacks (i.e. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack and bias injection attack) are taken into account to describe the adversary's attempt to destroy/deteriorate the system performance via communication network. It is the aim of the investigated issue to propose a set-membership state estimator ensuring the required estimation performance despite the existence of both the external mixed attacks and internal time delays. By resorting to the feasibility of a series of matrix inequalities, sufficient conditions are provided for the solvability of the addressed state estimator design problem. Furthermore, an optimisation strategy is developed with the purpose of seeking the local optimal estimator parameters. At last, a numerical simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical algorithm.

Firstly, based on the T-S fuzzy model, two form of nonfragile state feedback controllers are designed to stabilize the T-S fuzzy system, that is to say, nonfragile state feedback controllers minimize the H(2 )and H-infinity performance simultaneously. Then, by applying T-S fuzzy approach, the multiobjective H-2/H-infinity nonfragile fuzzy control problem is transformed into linear matrix inequality (LMI)-constrained multiobjective problem (MOP). In addition, we efficiently solve Pareto optimal solutions for the MOP by employing LMI-based multiobjective evolution algorithm (MOEA). Finally, the validity of this approach is illustrated by a realistic design example.

Most of the existing works focus on the resource allocation that considered the unequal and continuous time allocation for both source-relay and relay-destination links. However, the continuous time allocation may be infeasible since in practice, the time allocation shall be carried out in integral multiple of the subframe duration unit. In this article, we study a discrete time scheme from the perspective of frame structure, where one transmission block is divided into two phases and the linear mapping is employed as a re-encoding method to determine the number of subframes for both phases and the power allocation for each subframe in a relay-enabled BC system. Based on this, we derive an accurate system-throughput expression and formulate a mixed-integral non-convex optimization problem to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the power reflection coefficient (PRC) of the IoT node, the power allocation of the hybrid access point (HAP) and the linear mapping matrix, and solve it via a three-step approach. First, we derive the optimal eigenvalues of the linear mapping matrix via introducing auxiliary variables and exploiting Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Second, we employ the time-sharing technology to convert the discrete optimization problem to a continuous non-convex problem and solve it by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA) and monotonicity or bisection method. Finally, an integer conversion strategy is designed to find a suboptimal number of subframes for both phases, based on which the continuous variables are further optimized. According to the above approaches, we propose a low complexity iterative algorithm to obtain the throughput maximization-based resource allocation solution. Numerical results analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm, verify the superiority of our proposed scheme, and evaluate the impacts of network parameters on the system throughput.

Integration method for considering scheduling in design of heat exchange networks	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING												The objective of this work is to introduce a systematic procedure for incorporating heat integration and process scheduling into the design phase. A hierarchical approach is developed. First, a formulation is developed to account for the anticipated schedules and heat integration during the design phase. Because of the complexity of the formulation for heat integration with varying flows and temperatures, a new targeting approach has been introduced. A linearization approach is adopted by discretizing the searched space for temperatures. Then, integer cuts are added to select the optimal temperatures. This results in a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the targeting of minimum heating and cooling utilities for the various schedules. In order to synthesize a flexible configuration of the heat integration network, a multiperiod formulation is developed to account for the variations associated with the anticipated schedules. A case study of design and scheduling of a fluid catalytic cracking is solved to demonstrate the merits of the new approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The IRS designs under both the ideal IRS with continuous phase shifting and the non-ideal IRS with discrete phase shifting are considered. For both cases, by leveraging the isotropic random vector and the Laguerre series, we derive insightful results and closed-form expressions on performance measures including the average required transmit power, the outage probability, and the diversity order. Our analytical results show that the transmit power scales down linearly with the BS antenna number and quadratically with the IRS element number. The diversity order equals the smaller of the BS antenna number and the IRS element number with a scaling coefficient. Our results also reveal the effect of the phase quantization resolution to the system performance when non-ideal IRS is used. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of our analysis and the non-ideal IRS with four or more bits for quantization is shown to achieve nearly the same performance as the ideal IRS.

Cooperative Localization in Mobile Wireless Networks With Asynchronous Measurements and Communications	IEEE ACCESS												This paper studies the cooperative localization problem for mobile nodes. Different from the previous work which highly relies on the synchronized time-slotted systems, the cooperative localization framework we establish does not need any synchronization for the communication links and measurement processes in the entire wireless network. More specifically, the mobility of nodes is modeled by the stochastic differential equation, which allows the modeling of each node utilizing the asynchronously received messages and measurements in the continuous-time domain. To solve the cooperative localization problem, first we propose the centralized localization algorithm based on the global information. Then, we rigorously prove under what condition a localization estimation with partial information has a small performance gap from the one with global information. Finally, by applying this result at each node, the distributed prior-cut algorithm is designed to solve this asynchronous localization problem. Two cooperative localization examples are presented to corroborate the effectiveness of the distributed prior-cut algorithm in dealing with asynchronous communications and measurements.

J	Tan, X; Zhou, Y; Ding, ZH; Liu, Y				Tan, Xiao; Zhou, Yuan; Ding, Zuohua; Liu, Yang			Selecting Correct Methods to Extract Fuzzy Rules from Artificial Neural Network	MATHEMATICS												Artificial neural network (ANN) inherently cannot explain in a comprehensible form how a given decision or output is generated, which limits its extensive use. Fuzzy rules are an intuitive and reasonable representation to be used for explanation, model checking, and system integration. However, different methods may extract different rules from the same ANN. Which one can deliver good quality such that the ANN can be accurately described by the extracted fuzzy rules? In this paper, we perform an empirical study on three different rule extraction methods. The first method extracts fuzzy rules from a fuzzy neural network, while the second and third ones are originally designed to extract crisp rules, which can be transformed into fuzzy rules directly, from a well-trained ANN. In detail, in the second method, the behavior of a neuron is approximated by (continuous) Boolean functions with respect to its direct input neurons, whereas in the third method, the relationship between a neuron and its direct input neurons is described by a decision tree. We evaluate the three methods on discrete, continuous, and hybrid data sets by comparing the rules generated from sample data directly. The results show that the first method cannot generate proper fuzzy rules on the three kinds of data sets, the second one can generate accurate rules on discrete data, while the third one can generate fuzzy rules for all data sets but cannot always guarantee the accuracy, especially for data sets with poor separability. Hence, our work illustrates that, given an ANN, one should carefully select a method, sometimes even needs to design new methods for explanations.					liu, yang/HIU-0559-2022; yang, liu/HTN-9175-2023; LIU, YANG/HWQ-4615-2023; Liu, Yang/HNJ-6693-2023; liu, yang/HQY-7531-2023; liu, yang/HHY-8583-2022; yang, liu/GVU-8760-2022; Liu, Yang/D-2306-2013	Liu, Yang/0000-0001-7300-9215														2227-7390				JUN	2021	9	11							1164	10.3390/math9111164	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math9111164													WOS:000660253500001

The switching noise coupling is a concern for mixed-signal boards, highspeed I/Os, and electromagnetic compatibility. In GHz frequency regime, switching noise cannot be controlled by off-chip discrete decoupling capacitors due to their inductance. In this paper we introduce the non-overlapping power/ground planes design methodology for filtering of GHz power plane noise.

The problem is described in the form of an augment discrete-time tracking model integrated with AFS, DYC, and ARC. A mixed H-2/H-infinity tracking controller is proposed and the controller gain is obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Co-simulations with Simulink and TruckSim are carried out.

The resulting design is such that the filtering error system is asymptotically stable and meets the prescribed H-infinity norm constraint in normal case as well as in sensor failure case. What's worth mentioning is that the paper proposes a new method which combines S-procedure approach to solve the sector-bounded nonlinearities. A sufficient condition for the existence of such a filter is obtained by using appropriate Lyapunov functional and linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques. In addition, based on this result, a convex LMI-based optimization method is developed to optimize the H-infinity performance.

A connection is defined as the connected part that links different sets of departments through which some interdepartmental material flows must go. The goal of the problem is to select the location and capacity of the connections (and to assign the flows) so as to minimize the sum of the fixed connection installation costs and material movement cost in the material handing system. Mathematical programming formulations are presented for continuous and discrete capacity options. For the continuous unbounded capacity case, we prove that it can be reduced to the uncapacitated fixed charge facility location problem. For the discrete capacity case, a Lagrangian relaxation-based solution approach is developed. It provides a 'good' feasible solution as well as a lower bound for assessing the optimality gap. Computational results are reported. Our findings indicate that the discrete version of the problem can be effectively solved with the Lagrangian heuristic.

Resilience-driven restoration model for interdependent infrastructure networks	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY												Critical infrastructure networks such as electric power, water distribution, natural gas, transportation and telecommunications are the backbone of modern societies as they provide them with the services that are essential for their continuous functioning. However, these infrastructure networks are not isolated from each other but instead, most of them rely on one another to be functional. Hence, they are highly vulnerable to any disruptive event (e.g., components deteriorating, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters) which makes their restoration more challenging task for decision makers. In this paper, we study the restoration problem of a system of interdependent infrastructure networks following a disruption event considering different disruptions scenarios. We propose a resilience-driven multi-objective restoration model using mixed-integer programming that aims to maximize the resilience of the system of interdependent infrastructure networks while minimizing the total cost associated with the restoration process. The restoration model considers the availability of limited time and resources and provides a prioritized list of components, nodes or links, to be restored along with assigning and scheduling them to the available work crews. The proposed model is illustrated through a generated system of interdependent power-water networks, however it is applicable to any physically interdependent networks.

J	Feng, Y; Wang, HX; Yang, H; Wang, FB				Feng, Yuan; Wang, Hexiang; Yang, Han; Wang, Fangbo			Time-continuous energy-conservation neural network for structural dynamics analysis	NEUROCOMPUTING												Fast and accurate structural dynamics analysis is important for structural design and damage assessment. Structural dynamics analysis leveraging machine learning techniques has become a popular research focus in recent years. Although the basic neural network provides an alternative approach for structural dynamics analysis, the lack of physics law inside the neural network limits the model accuracy and fidelity. In this paper, a new family of the energy-conservation neural network is introduced, which respects the physical laws. The neural network is explored from a fundamental single-degree-of-freedom system to a complicated multiple-degrees-of-freedom system. The damping force and external forces are also considered step by step. To improve the parallelization of the algorithm, the derivatives of the structural states are parameterized with the novel energy-conservation neural network instead of specifying the discrete sequence of structural states. The proposed model uses the system energy as the last layer of the neural network and leverages the underlying automatic differentiation graph to incorporate the system energy naturally, which ultimately improves the accuracy and long-term stability of structural dynamics response calculation under an earthquake impact. The trade-off between computation accuracy and speed is discussed. As a case study, a 3-story building earthquake simulation is conducted with realistic earthquake records. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

First, tunable parameters and cubic convex combination approach are proposed to study the globally exponential convergence of switched neural networks. Second, a sufficient criterion for the existence, uniqueness, and globally exponential stability of a periodic solution is demonstrated by using contraction mapping theorem and the impulse-delay-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method. It is worth emphasizing that the addressed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional covers both triple integral terms and novel quadruple integral terms, which makes the conservatism of the above criteria decrease. Even if the original neural network models are unstable or the impulsive effects are strong, the addressed neural network model can produce a globally exponentially stable periodic solution.

J	Prakash, S; Mukherjee, I				Prakash, Satya; Mukherjee, Indrajit			An enhanced solution approach for multi-period discrete manufacturing product assembly inventory routing problem with supply failure risks and customer demand uncertainty	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT												PurposeThis study primarily aims to develop and solve an enhanced optimisation model for an assembly product multi-period inbound inventory routing problem (IRP). The many-to-one (inbound) model considers the bill of materials (BOM), supply failure risks (SFR) and customer demand uncertainty. The secondary objective is to study the influence of potential time-dependent model variables on the overall supply network costs based on a full factorial design of experiments (DOE). Design/methodology/approachA five-step solution approach is proposed to derive the optimal inventory levels, best sourcing strategy and vehicle route plans for a multi-period discrete manufacturing product assembly IRP. The proposed approach considers an optimal risk mitigation strategy by considering less risk-prone suppliers to deliver the required components in a specific period. A mixed-integer linear programming formulation was solved to derive the optimal supply network costs. FindingsThe simulation results indicate that lower demand variation, lower component price and higher supply capacity can provide superior cost performance for an inbound supply network. The results also demonstrate that increasing supply capacity does not necessarily decrease product shortages. However, when demand variation is high, product shortages are reduced at the expense of the supply network cost. Research limitations/implicationsA two-echelon supply network for a single assembled discrete product with homogeneous vehicle fleet availability was considered in this study. Originality/valueThe proposed multi-period inbound IRP model considers realistic SFR, customer demand uncertainties and product assembly requirements based on a specific BOM. The mathematical model includes various practical aspects, such as supply capacity constraints, supplier management costs and target service-level requirements. A sensitivity analysis based on a full factorial DOE provides new insights that can aid practitioners in real-life decision-making.

By considering some realistic factors including delays, disturbance and topology changes, the well-known leaky integrate-and-fire model is modified as a switched neural network so that function of a single neuron is identified via the H-infinity filtering instead of biological experimental methods. With the aid of average dwell time method, we provide a delay-dependent sufficient condition, under which the designed filter for the function of every individual neuron in BNNs satisfies H-infinity noise attenuation and exponential stability. Moreover, the design of such a filter is converted into a convex optimisation problem, which can be easily solved by using standard numerical software. Finally, two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Robust Quasi-decentralized Networked Control of Process Systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 48TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL, 2009 HELD JOINTLY WITH THE 2009 28TH CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE (CDC/CCC 2009)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control				Joint 48th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) / 28th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)	DEC 15-18, 2009	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, Honeywell, Quanser, United Technologies, Googol Tech, MathWorks, Natl Instruments				This paper presents a quasi-decentralized networked control methodology for the robust stabilization of multi-unit plants whose constituent subsystems communicate over a shared resource-constrained communication network and are subject to time-varying external disturbances. The objective is to stabilize the plant while keeping the communication requirements to a minimum in order to reduce the unnecessary utilization of network resources. Initially, a local robust feedback controller is synthesized for each unit to account for the effect of the disturbances. Then the exchange of information between the local control systems is reduced by embedding, within each control system, a set of dynamic models that provide forecasts of the evolution of the plant units when measurements are not transmitted through the shared network, and updating the state of each model when communication is re-established at discrete time instances. By analyzing the resulting combined discrete-continuous closed-loop system, a necessary and sufficient condition for robust stability of the networked closed-loop plant is obtained. The stability condition can be used to explicitly characterize the interplays between the update period, the degree of plant-model mismatch, the selection of the controller design parameters, the size of the disturbances and the size of the achievable ultimate bound on the closed-loop state. Finally, the implementation of the robust networked control structure is demonstrated through an application to a chemical plant example.																			0743-1546		978-1-4244-3872-3				2009							5851	5856		10.1109/CDC.2009.5400354	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5400354													WOS:000336893606058

By applying Jensen's inequality, an extended Jensen's double integral inequality, and a free matrix form inequality to the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), delay-dependent conditions are derived and solved by the Matlab control toolbox in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By stability criteria, this paper is less conservative than the other works. In addition, we demonstrate the advantage of our obtained methods by five numerical examples.

J	Lora, M; Muradore, R; Quaglia, D; Fummi, F				Lora, Michele; Muradore, Riccardo; Quaglia, Davide; Fummi, Franco			Simulation alternatives for the verification of networked cyber-physical systems	MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS												Several embedded system applications are used to control physical processes thus leading to the concept of Cyber-Physical System. Sensing, computation and actuation are combined by involving a set of highly heterogeneous components, i.e., digital and analog hardware, software, energy sources, and external physical systems (e.g., a room to be heated, a mechanical component). Moreover, we see the growing use of networks to connect several sub-systems in a more efficient way; this contributes to introduce a further level of heterogeneity due to the presence of messages exchanged over communication channels. All these aspects should be taken into account in the design process to find highly optimized solutions; in particular, simulation is a key technique for their verification. However, the heterogeneity of components, together with the presence of the network, forces to adopt complex and slow co-simulation techniques to carry on the simulation of the entire system. This work aims at proposing SystemC as unified framework to model and simulate Networked Cyber-Physical Systems. Concerning the modeling of continuous-time components and a specific class of discretetime components, the different Models of Computation provided by the Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) extension of SystemC are used. Regarding the network, SystemC and the SystemC Network Simulation Library are used to model communications at different abstraction levels. The approach is validated by considering a networked control system. First, the accuracy and speed of SystemC simulation is compared to Matlab/Simulink simulation. Second, different simulation alternatives are compared to co-simulation. Finally, we show that the simulation speed-up achieved by all-SystemC modeling allows to explore several design alternatives and the accurate modeling of the communication network can improve the design of the controller.

It can be approached using global optimization models or iterative procedures. In this paper, after a brief review of the state of the art, the main characteristics of the iterative procedure ENETS are described. In this procedure, traffic signal setting is performed in two successive steps: green timing and scheduling at each junction, and signal coordination on the network. Green timin and scheduling at a single junction is based on a mixed-binary linear program with capacity factor maximization. Signal coordination for the whole network is performed by solving a discrete programming model with total delay minimization. The flow assignment stage refers to the separable user equilibrium model with fixed demand, and uses a feasible direction algorithm, which can also be adopted to cover the cases of elastic demand and/or asymmetric equilibrium. An experimental test of ENETS on a small network and a graphical explanation of the procedure are described and discussed.

Relational Covariate Adjustment is implemented through two high-level operations: identification of an adjustment set and relational regression adjustment. The former is achieved through an extension of Pearl's back-door criterion to relational domains. We demonstrate how this extended definition can be used to estimate causal effects in the presence of network interference and confounding. RCA is agnostic to functional form, and it can easily model both discrete and continuous treatments as well as estimate the effects of a wider array of network interventions than existing experimental approaches. We show that RCA can yield robust estimates of causal effects using common regression models without extensive parameter tuning. Through a series of simulation experiments on a variety of synthetic and real world network structures, we show that causal effects estimated on observational data with RCA are nearly as accurate as those estimated from well-designed network experiments.

The mixed delays include constant delay in the leakage term (i.e., "leakage delay"), time-varying delay and continuously distributed delay. By using the Lyapunov functional method, reciprocal convex approach, linear convex combination technique, Jensen integral inequality and the free-weight matrix method, several novel sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point of the considered networks in mean square. The proposed results, which do not require the differentiability and monotonicity of the activation functions, can be easily checked via Matlab software.

In residual networks, instead of having a discrete sequence of hidden layers, the derivative of the continuous dynamics of hidden state can be parameterized by an ODE. It has been shown that this type of neural network is able to produce the same results as an equivalent residual network for image classification. In this paper, we design a novel neural ODE for the semantic segmentation task. We start by a baseline network that consists of residual modules, then we use the modules to build our neural ODE network. We show that our neural ODE is able to achieve the state-of-the-art results using 57% less memory for training, 42% less memory for testing, and 68% less number of parameters. We evaluate our model on the Cityscapes, CamVid, LIP, and PASCAL-Context datasets.

One of the main objectives is to overcome the numerical difficulties associated with solving the underlying large-scale mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP). The approach that is proposed relies on a simulation-based optimization strategy that uses a discrete-event system to model the SC. Within this framework, each SC entity is represented as an agent whose activity is described by a collection of states and transitions. The overall system is coupled with an optimization algorithm that is designed to improve its operation. This strategy is a very attractive alternative in the field of decision-making processes under uncertainty, the advantages of which are highlighted with some cases of SC networks that are composed of several plants, warehouses, distribution centers, and retailers.

J	Wolf, V				Wolf, Verena			Modelling of Biochemical Reactions by Stochastic Automata Networks	ELECTRONIC NOTES IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE												This paper presents a stochastic modelling framework based on stochastic automata networks (SANs) for the analysis of complex biochemical reaction networks. Our approach takes into account the discrete character of quantities of components (i.e. the individual populations of the involved chemical species) and the inherent probabilistic nature of microscopic molecular collisions. Moreover, as for process calculi that have recently been applied to systems in biology, the SAN approach has the advantage of a modular design process being adequate for abstraction purposes. The associated composition operator leads to an elegant and compact representation of the underlying continuous-time Markov chain in form of a Kronecker product. SANs have been extensively used in performance analysis of computer systems and a large variety of numerical and simulative analysis algorithms exist. We illustrate that describing a biochemical reaction network by means of a SAN offers promising opportunities to get insight into the quantitative behaviour of systems in biology while taking advantage of the benefits of a compositional modelling approach.

Stability period and network lifetime are key issues to judge and analyse the working of the sensor nodes and the efficiency of the sensor network system for a long time. Designing energy efficient multi-tasking clustering protocols for data collection and supporting event based applications in various environments is the main goal for the researchers. This paper proposes a protocol based on broad and crossover transmission distance for homogeneous sensor network system and effect of various scales such as the number of nodes and different initial energies of all the nodes on it. Homogeneous broad transmission distance protocol (HMBTDP) is put forward for event-specific and field-specific applications where sub-periods of lifetime are also important along with stability period and entire span of the network. Performance parameters for evaluation are alive nodes metrics depicting that thisprotocol outperforms the previous existing homogeneous protocols and thus enhancing network energy efficiency.					kulat, k d/AAA-7790-2022																978-1-5090-5384-1				2016							115	120																WOS:000406466200023

An unusual approach, ligand-oriented polyhedral networking via click chemistry and further metal coordination is reported here. An alkyne decorated Cu(II)-MOP self-catalyzes the regioselective click reaction (1,3-dipolar cycloaddition) using azide-functionalized ligands under unconventional reaction conditions. Introducing new metal ions, M(II), interlinks the carboxylic groups on the MOP surfaces creating coordination networks. On the other hand, exposure of the respective individual ligand components in the presence of Cu(II) promotes an in-situ click reaction along with metal coordination generating a new 3D-framework.

Cooperative Reinforcement Learning Approach for Routing in Ad Hoc Networks	2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PERVASIVE COMPUTING (ICPC)					International Conference on Pervasive Computing (ICPC)	JAN 08-10, 2015	Pune, INDIA	IEEE Pune Sect, IEEE Comp Soc, Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, IEEE Commun Soc Pune Chapter, Sinhgad Inst, Sakal Times				Most of the routing algorithms over ad hoc networks are based on the status of the link (up or down). They are not capable of adapting the run time changes such as traffic load, delay and delivery time to reach to the destination etc, thus though provides shortest path, these shortest path may not be optimum path to deliver the packets. Optimum path can only be achieved when quality of links within the network is detected on continuous basis instead of discrete time. Thus for achieving optimum routes we model ad hoc routing as a cooperative reinforcement learning problem. In this paper, agents are used to optimize the performance of a network on trial and error basis. This learning strategy is based work in swarm intelligence: those systems whose design is inspired by models of social insect behaviour. This paper describes the algorithm used in cooperative reinforcement learning approach and performs the analysis by comparing with existing routing protocols.

The plant and the controller are assumed to be connected by communication channels with i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) time-varying delays. The delays are theoretically not required to be bounded even when the plant is unstable in the deterministic sense. In our NCS, the sampling interval is supposed to be determined directly by such communication delays. A necessary and sufficient inequality condition is presented for designing a state-feedback controller stabilizing the NCS at sampling points in a stochastic sense. The results are also illustrated numerically.

In contrast to conventional systems, in the switching systems, the control signal consists of the active mode (discrete) and the control inputs (continuous). First, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of the hybrid action space is derived, and a two-stage value iteration method is proposed to learn the optimal solution. In addition, a neural network structure is designed by decomposing the Q-function into the value function and the normalized advantage value function, which is quadratic with respect to the continuous control of subsystems. In this way, the Q-function and the continuous policy can be simultaneously updated at each iteration step so that the training of hybrid policies is simplified to a one-step manner. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm with consideration of approximation error is provided. Finally, the algorithm is applied evaluated on three different simulation examples. Compared to the related work, the results demonstrate the potential of our method.					sun, chang/ITV-6759-2023; SUN, CHANG/GXM-3680-2022	Li, Xiaofeng/0000-0002-1347-4032; Dong, Lu/0000-0001-6737-1381													2162-237X	2162-2388				NOV	2023	34	11					9161	9170		10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3156287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3156287		APR 2022						35417353					WOS:000782817900001

Non-fragile Observer-Based Control for Discrete-Time Systems Using Passivity Theory	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING												In this paper, non-fragile observer-based controller design is investigated for a class of discrete-time systems. The system under consideration is assumed to have random fluctuations in both the state feedback controller gain and observer gain matrices. The random fluctuations are defined using Bernoulli-distributed white sequences with time-varying probability measures. The probability-dependent controller gains are designed to guarantee the stochastic stability of the system with a prescribed mixed and passivity performance. Lyapunov stability theory, passivity theory and a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach are used to derive sufficient conditions for the existence of the state feedback controller and observer gains. The probability-dependent gain-scheduled controllers are designed based on a convex optimization problem using a set of LMIs, which can be easily solved with standard numerical packages.

Transmission electron microscopy characterizations indicated that functionalized MWCNTs (f-MWCNTs) could be well-distributed in PA66 matrix and the interfacial boundary between them was indiscernible. The mixing conditions, such as f-MWCNT content, temperature, and mixing speed, played important roles in determining the formation of the conductive network and the electrical conductivities of PA66/f-MWCNT composites synthesized. A continuous conductive network was formed at 10 wt% f-MWCNT content, and the corresponding PA66/f-MWCNT composite exhibited an electrical conductivity of 8 orders of magnitude higher than pure PA66.

We formulate a joint design of remote radio head (RRH) selection, RRH-user association, and transmit beamforming for simultaneously optimizing the achievable sum rate and total power consumption, using the multi-objective optimization concept. Due to the non-convexity of per-fronthaul capacity constraints and introduced binary selection variables, the formulated problem is combinatorial and nonconvex, which is generally NP-hard. To deal with this difficulty, we develop a new framework which iteratively approximates the continuous non-convex constraints by convex ones in the form of second order cones. The problem arrived at each iteration is a mixed integer second order cone programming which can be solve optimally and efficiently. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms converge rapidly and outperform the existing solutions.

Fortunately, edge caching as a promising technology to reduce system energy consumption and transmission latency is attracting wide attention. Although simply deploying cache in edge network and merely shutting down the idle base stations (BSs) during the idle periods can save certain energy to a certain extent, in this case, the contents with important mission cached in idle BSs cannot be accessed by users that will affect users' experience. In this paper, we employ coded caching encoded by maximum distance separable (MDS) codes at the network edge, and we propose a joint coded caching and BS sleeping strategy, which utilizes the reconstruction feature of MDS codes to alleviate the impact of BS sleeping. Furthermore, the problem of minimizing energy consumption is studied, and we also design a discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm that is suitable to solve this mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Simulation results reveal that energy consumption of the joint coded caching and BS sleeping strategy can be significantly decreased over 15.2% when compared with the current state-of-art strategy. Meanwhile, our proposed strategy can also improve the cache hit rate up to a maximum 11.1% compared with the existing strategies.

Those systems possess the property that their input-output product time-integral, which is a measure of the total enerty, is nonnegative. Such a property can be also formulated in the discrete context. It is shown that a discrete positive real transfer function is obtained from a positive real continuous one of relative order zero being strictly stable poles via discretization by a sampler and zero-order hold device provided that the direct input-output transmission gain is sufficiently large. It is also proved that a discrete positive real transfer function may be obtained from a stable continuous one of relative order zero and high direct input-output gain which posses simple complex conjugate critically stable poles even in the case that this one is not positive real. For that purpose, the use of an appropriate phase-lag or phase lead compensating network for the continuous transfer function may be required to ensure positive realness of the discrete transfer function.					de la Sen, manuel/A-8803-2008	de la Sen, manuel/0000-0001-9320-9433													1385-1292	1572-9281					2002	6	1					31	45		10.1023/A:1012071600240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1012071600240													WOS:000171811100003

Mainly in digital circuits, the power consumption was defined by the dynamic power consumption, during decades. But in the new NanoCMOs technologies, the static power due to the leakage current is becoming the main issue in power consumption. As the leakage power is related to the amount of components, it is becoming mandatory to reduce the amount of transistors in any type of design, to reduce power consumption. So, it is important to obtain new EDA algorithms and tools to optimize the amount of components (transistors). It is also needed tools for the layout design automation that are able to design any network of components that is provided by an optimization tool that is able to reduce the size of the network of components. It is presented an example of a layout design automation tool that can do the layout of any network of transistors using transistors of any size. Another issue for power optimization is the use of tools and algorithms for gate sizing. The designer can manage the sizing of transistors to reduce power consumption, without compromising the clock frequency. There are two types of gate sizing, discrete gate sizing and continuous gate sizing. The discrete gate sizing tools are used when it is being used a cell library that has only few available sizes for each cell. The continuous gate sizing considers that the EDA tool can define any transistor sizing. In this case, the designer needs to have a layout design tool able to do the layout of transistors with any size. It will be presented the winner tools of the ISPD Contest 2012 and 2013. Also, it will be discussed the inclusion of our gate sizing algorithms in an industrial flow used to design state-of-the-art microprocessors. Another type of EDA tool that is becoming more and more useful is the visualization tools that provide an animated visual output of the running of EDA tools. This kind of tools is very useful to show to the tool developers how the tool is running. So, the EDA developers can use this information to improve the algorithms used in an EDA Tool.

Multistage anaerobic digestion, in which multiple digesters are operated in a network are designed to optimize each process reaction, but very few writers have drawn on any systematic procedure for the design of digester networks. This study is about multistage digester networks, but contrary to traditional multistage digestion articles that focus on the experimental evaluation of a predefined network configuration, this study develops a systematic methodological framework based on the concept of attainable regions for optimal synthesis of digester networks. Within the framework, a simplified model is developed, which accounts for the geometric characteristics of fundamental anaerobic digester types. The model is validated with experimental data of diary, horse, goat, chicken and swine manure, and shows good agreement (model errors between 0.01 and 0.06). The attainable regions and their optimized parameters differ for each digested substrate, and the optimal networks are made of different combinations of digesters operated in a continuous (axial mixing) and/or plug flow (no axial mixing) mode. This substrate effect on attainable regions shows great promises as it paves the way for other substrates such as food waste, lignocellulosic waste, co-digested feeds, etc. This study though preliminary presents a breakthrough in extending the use of digester networks to solve more operational challenges as well as support retrofitting multi-stage systems into facilities where single-stage digesters already exist.

These entries are driven by using a continuous miner with attached conveying system to extract locked up coal behind the highwall slope when the open cut coal mine reaches its ultimate limit. These entries are driven unmanned, unventilated and unsupported. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of structural features ahead of operations is essential in assessing the stability of these entries. Highwall mining operations can greatly benefit from accurate structural mapping of rock mass defects. The stability of these entries can be suitably assessed for any major roof failure by adopting discrete fracture network based structural modelling to characterize and delineate the regions of possible major roof failures to prevent damage to the conveyor and burial of the expensive continuous miner. In this paper, a generalized framework is described based on photogrammetric survey, digital mapping and discrete fracture network based structural modelling to characterise such failures for an Indian highwall mining operation. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken to demonstrate the significance of structure persistence in the geotechnical assessment. Such analysis would provide more insight into designing highwall mining layouts and in predicting possible impending highwall failures, and indirectly facilitates reducing machine downtime for better management of highwall mining operations.

A sampled-data approach to distributed <i>H<sub>∞</sub></i> resilient state estimation for a class of nonlinear time-delay systems over sensor networks	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												This paper deals with the distributed sampled-data H-infinity state estimation problem for a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems with infinite-distributed delays. To cater for possible implementation errors, the estimator gain is allowed to have certain bounded parameter variations. A sensor network is deployed to acquire the plant output by collaborating with their neighbors according to a given network topology. The individually sampled sensor measurement is transmitted to the corresponding estimator through a digital communication channel. By utilizing the input delay approach, the effect of the sam-pling intervals is transformed into an equivalent bounded time-varying delay. A set of sampled-data distributed estimators is designed for the addressed nonlinear systems in order to meet the following three performance requirements: (1) the asymptotic convergence of the estimation error dynamics; (2) the H-infinity disturbance attenuation/rejection behavior against the exogenous disturbances; and (3) the re-silience against possible gain variations.

For the sake of technical simplicity, only two different sampling periods are considered, their occurrence probabilities are given constants and satisfy Bernoulli distribution, and can be extended to the case with multiple stochastic sampling periods. By the way of an input delay, the probabilistic system is transformed into a stochastic continuous time-delay system. A new linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based procedure is proposed for designing state-feedback controllers, which would guarantee that the closed-loop networked system with stochastic sampling tracks the output of a given reference model well in the sense of H-infinity. Conservatism is reduced by taking the probability into account. Both network-induced delays and packet dropouts have been considered. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed H-infinity output tracking design. (C) 2013 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, discrete variables are used to estimate quality indicators directly through the time-series model, in which the sliding window is used to extract time-series features of the process signals. As discrete variables can be served as samples of a continuous function, this article proposes a soft sensing method whose inputs follow a continuous function. The continuous function is estimated by discrete variables and used to estimate quality indicators. Meanwhile, in the time-series model, the features extracted by the signals within the sliding window are inconsistent with the ones with all the historical signals, and thus, the time-series model lacks interpretability. To make a consistent prediction when the length of the time-series signals changes, this article proposes the windowed convolutional transformation to extract the features of the evaluated continuous function of discrete inputs. Besides, the proposed windowed convolutional transformation can automatically deal with the time delay in the process variables and quality indicators. To effectively calculate the gradients of the windowed convolutional transformation, a memory-efficient gradient estimation method for neural ordinary differential equations with inputs is designed. Finally, a soft-sensing method based on windowed convolutional transformation is proposed.

Optimal query assignment for wireless sensor networks	AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS												Increasing computing capabilities of modern sensors have enabled current wireless sensor networks to process queries within the network. This complements the traditional features of the sensor networks such as sensing the environment and communicating the data. Query processing, however, poses Quality of Service challenges such as query waiting time and validity (age) of the data. We focus on the processing cost of queries as a trade-off between the time queries wait to be processed and the age of the data provided to the queries. To model this trade-off, we propose a Continuous Time Markov Decision Process which assigns queries either to the sensor network, where queries wait to be processed, or to a central database, which provides stored and possibly outdated data. To compute an optimal query assignment policy, a Discrete Time Markov Decision Process, shown to be stochastically equivalent to the initial continuous time process, is formulated. A comparative numerical analysis of the Performance of the optimal assignment policy and of several heuristics, derived from practice, is performed. This provides a theoretical support for the design and implementation of WSN applications, while ensuring a close-to-optimum performance of the system. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

On robust state derivative feedback control for uncertain polytopic systems with uncertain sampling period and network-induced delay	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												This paper addresses the state derivative feedback control problem for uncertain polytopic systems subject to an uncertain sampling period and network-induced delay. The distinctive contribution relies on the direct design of a robust state derivative feedback controller employing an augmented discretized model derived in terms of the state derivative feedback such that network-induced delay and uncertain sampling periods can be incorporated from the original continuous-time state-space representation into the discretized model. Two augmented models are provided to handle longer input time delays, as well as delays less or equal to the sampling period. In this work, all the uncertain parameters are modeled as a polytopic form whose resulting discrete-time model has matrices with polynomial dependence on the uncertain parameters and an additive norm-bounded term featuring the discretization residual error. Moreover, synthesis conditions are derived using a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) to solve the stabilization problem for this class of systems under different input time delays. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.																			1561-8625	1934-6093				SEP	2023	25	5					3412	3430		10.1002/asjc.3072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asjc.3072		APR 2023											WOS:000972931300001

Moreover, the structure and parameter identifications of models are generally performed in two stages, and this always attends to one thing and loses another in terms of interpretability and predictive performance. In this paper, a fuzzy neural network regression method (FNNR) that coordinates structure identification and parameter identification is proposed. To alleviate the problem of rule explosion, the structure identification and parameter identification are coordinated in the training process, and the numbers of fuzzy rules and fuzzy partitions are effectively limited, while the parameters of fuzzy rules are optimized. The symmetrical architecture of the FNNR is designed for automatic structure identification. An alternate training strategy is adopted by treating discrete and continuous parameters differently, and thus the convergence efficiency of the algorithm is improved. To enhance interpretability, regularized terms are designed from fuzzy rule level and fuzzy partition level to guide the model to learn fuzzy rules with simple structures and clear semantics. The experimental results show that the proposed method has both a compact structure and high precision.					chen, huan/KEC-2019-2024; Yu, Xiaohan/KCK-5462-2024; Liu, Junjie/KHV-6949-2024; Wang, Jiawei/KHC-8971-2024															2073-8994				SEP	2023	15	9							1711	10.3390/sym15091711	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym15091711													WOS:001074629500001

While audio in nature is a continuous signal, current approaches treat it as discrete data (i.e., input is defined on discrete time domain), and consider the super resolution over a fixed scale factor (i.e., it is required to train a new neural network to change output resolution). To obtain a continuous representation of audio and enable super resolution for arbitrary scale factor, we propose a method of implicit neural representation, coined Local Implicit representation for Super resolution of Arbitrary scale (LISA). Our method locally parameterizes a chunk of audio as a function of continuous time, and represents each chunk with the local latent codes of neighboring chunks so that the function can extrapolate the signal at any time coordinate, i.e., infinite resolution. To learn a continuous representation for audio, we design a self-supervised learning strategy to practice super resolution tasks up to the original resolution by stochastic selection. Our numerical evaluation shows that LISA outperforms the previous fixed-scale methods with a fraction of parameters, but also is capable of arbitrary scale super resolution even beyond the resolution of training data.																			1520-6149		978-1-6654-0540-9				2022							3703	3707		10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746083													WOS:000864187903197

Their dense deployment will increase data rates, reduce latency, and enable efficient data transport between the access and backhaul networks, providing greater flexibility not previously possible with optical fiber. Despite their high potential, operating dense self-backhauled networks optimally is an open challenge, particularly for radio resource management (RRM). This paper presents, RadiOrchestra, a holistic RRM framework that models and optimizes beamforming, rate selection as well as user association and admission control for self-backhauled networks. The framework is designed to account for practical challenges such as hardware limitations of base stations (e.g., computational capacity, discrete rates), the need for adaptability of backhaul links, and the presence of interference. Our framework is formulated as a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is challenging to solve. To approach this problem, we propose three algorithms that provide a trade-off between complexity and optimality. Furthermore, we derive upper and lower bounds to characterize the performance limits of the system. We evaluate the developed strategies in various scenarios, showing the feasibility of deploying practical self-backhauling in future networks.

An approximation (known as abstraction) is itself a continuous-space system, which can be used as a replacement of the original (known as concrete) system in a controller design process. Having synthesized a controller for the abstract system, the controller is refined to a more detailed controller for the concrete system. To quantify the mismatch between the output trajectory of the approximation and of that the original system, we use the notion of so-called simulation functions. In particular, each subsystem in the concrete network and its corresponding one in the abstract network is related through a local simulation function. We show that if the local simulation functions satisfy a certain small-gain type condition developed for a network of infinitely many subsystems, then the aggregation of the individual simulation functions provides an overall simulation function between the overall abstraction and the concrete network. For a network of linear switched systems, we systematically construct local abstractions and local simulation functions, where the required conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities and can be efficiently computed. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through an application to frequency control in a power gird with a switched (i.e. time-varying) topology.

The model takes into account mixed time-delays, sensor nonlinearities and exogenous disturbances, making it relatively general and comprehensive. The transmission of MJNNs signals invoked a communication scheme in which the RRP is used for the data transmissions in order to avoid undesirable data collisions. Protocol-dependent state estimator modeling of a hybrid switching system with mixed time delays and disturbances is designed for the first time to achieve asymptotic tracing for the neuron state. Using the Lyapunov stability theory and several asymptotic methods, sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the state estimation are established under the constraint of H-infinity performance. By employing a combination of matrix analysis techniques, the estimator gain matrices are calculated by the feasible solutions to the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

The design methodology is based on the hybrid automata model that represents the system behaviour by means of the interaction of continuous dynamics and discrete events. The architecture is composed by means of modules which realize the mode recognition and diagnostic tasks both based on residuals generated using models. Both tasks interact each other since the diagnosis module adapts accordingly to the current mode of the hybrid system. The mode recognition task involves detecting the mode change and identification by determining the set of residuals that are consistent with the current mode of the hybrid system. On the other hand, the diagnostic task involves detecting and isolating the fault by identifying the fault that can explain the set of residuals that are observed as inconsistent.

Firstly, HRNet was used as the backbone feature extraction network, and the atrous separable convolution was used to improve its widely used residual module, so as to reduce the amount of parameters and improve the segmentation ability of multi-scale targets. Secondly, the mixed cavity convolution framework was used to design the multi-level cavity rate, which can dense the receptive field and reduce the influence of the grid problem. Then, a multi-stage continuous up-sampling structure was designed to improve the simple post fusion mechanism of HRNetV2. Finally, the improved pyramid pooling module which can adapt to different image resolutions was used to aggregate the context information of different regions to obtain high-quality segmentation images. The accuracy of 83. 3% MIOU is achieved with only 16. 4 Mbit parameters on the CityScapes urban landscape dataset, and good results are also achieved on the Camvid dataset.

However, most existing research has primarily focused on asymptotic stability, neglecting the crucial aspect of boundedness. In light of this, this paper aims to address the issues concerning the generalized Lyapunov stability theory of distributed-order systems and its application to ensure uniform boundedness and global attractiveness for distributed-order Hopfield neural networks (DOHNNs) with time-varying external input. To achieve this, several essential inequalities that form the foundation of our main work are proposed. Subsequently, two stability criteria in the form of generalized distributed-order Lyapunov theorem are derived by employing Laplace transform techniques. Meanwhile, building upon the proposed inequalities and Lyapunov theorem, sufficient conditions that guarantee the uniform boundedness and global attractiveness of DOHNNs with time-varying external input are established. By the way, all our proposed conclusions are presented in both continuous-time and discrete-time cases to present the distinction and relationship between these two cases. Finally, various simulation examples are designed meticulously to validate the correctness of our proposed theorems and the effectiveness to real-world applicability of our approach.

ZNNs are usually used to process the continuous-time signal in time-variant systems as continuous-time ZNN (CTZNN) models. Since digit devices and computers are widely applied in science and engineering, it is necessary to develop a general method to discretize CTZNN models to discrete-time ZNN (DTZNN) models. In previous work, Euler forward difference and two types of three-step Zhang et al. discretization (ZeaD) formulas were applied to discretize CTZNN models. In this paper, a three-step general ZeaD formula based on Taylor expansion is designed to approximate the first-order derivative of the target point, and discretize CTZNN models for time-variant matrix inversion. In comparison, the two types of three-step ZeaD formulas are the special cases of the proposed general ZeaD formula. For the situation of the time derivative of objective matrix unknown, two formulas of estimating the derivative are provided, and two other corresponding threestep general DTZNN models are proposed. Theoretical analyses present the stability and convergence of the three general DTZNN models for time-variant matrix inversion. The numerical experiment results substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the three proposed general DTZNN models for time-variant matrix inversion with the theoretical steady-state residual errors, comparing with those of Newton iteration and one-step DTZNN model. In addition, by comparing the numerical results of the two general DTZNN models for the situation of the time derivative of objective matrix unknown with the one of the derivative known, the steady-state residual errors of the formers are slightly bigger than the latter.

In this paper, we consider the training of NNs with discrete-valued weights and sign activation functions that can be implemented more efficiently in terms of inference speed, memory requirements, and power consumption. We build on the framework of probabilistic forward propagations using the local reparameterization trick, where instead of training a single set of NN weights we rather train a distribution over these weights. Using this approach, we can perform gradient-based learning by optimizing the continuous distribution parameters over discrete weights while at the same time perform backpropagation through the sign activation. In our experiments, we investigate the influence of the number of weights on the classification performance on several benchmark datasets, and we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

On the other hand, these models must be discrete in time, given their practical implementation in computer systems, requiring their versatile utilization across arbitrary time scales. Hence, the goal of this research is to model and investigate the architecture design of a delayed RNN using delayed differential equations on a time scale. Internal memory can be utilized to describe the calculation of the future states using discrete and distributed delays, which is a representation of the deep learning architecture for artificial RNNs. We focus on qualitative behavior and stability study of the system. Special attention is paid to taking into account the effect of the time-scale parameters on neural network dynamics. Here, we delve into the exploration of exponential stability in RNN models on a time scale that incorporates multiple discrete and distributed delays. Two approaches for constructing exponential estimates, including the Hilger and the usual exponential functions, are considered and compared. The Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional method is employed to study stability on a time scale in both cases. The established stability criteria, resulting in an exponential-like estimate, utilizes a tuple of positive definite matrices, decay rate, and graininess of the time scale. The models of RNNs for the two-neuron network with four discrete and distributed delays, as well as the ring lattice delayed network of seven identical neurons, are numerically investigated. The results indicate how the time scale (graininess) and model characteristics (weights) influence the qualitative behavior, leading to a transition from stable focus to quasiperiodic limit cycles.

A mixed integer non-linear program model is built, with a strategic planning level that decides the fleet size and the station capacity and an operational level that decides on the required relocation operations. The state of charge (SOC) of the vehicles parked in one station is assumed to follow a continuous distribution. A rolling horizon method is used to optimize the operational decisions over the course of a day, considering demand fluctuations and the limited battery capacity of the vehicles. A golden section line search method and a shadow price algorithm are developed to optimize the fleet size and station capacity, with the results feeding back to the carsharing operations. To demonstrate the applicability of the formulated models and solution algorithms, a large-scale case study is conducted for Suzhou Industrial Park, China as the region of operation. A two-step verification method that combines an optimization model via tracking of individual vehicle SOC and a discrete event simulation, demonstrates the accuracy of the SOC distribution model. Managerial insights from the application are also presented. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The idea is to solve for an action dependent value function Q(x, u, w) of the zero-sum game instead of solving for the state dependent value function V(x) which satisfies a corresponding game algebraic Riccati equation (GARE). Since the state and actions spaces are continuous, two action networks and one critic network are used that are adaptively tuned in forward time using adaptive critic methods. The result is a Q-learning approximate dynamic programming (ADP) model-free approach that solves the zero-sum game forward in time. It is shown that the critic converges to the game value function and the action networks converge to the Nash equilibrium of the game. Proofs of convergence of the algorithm are shown. It is proven that the algorithm ends up to be a model-free iterative algorithm to solve the GARE of the linear quadratic discrete-time zero-sum game. The effectiveness of this method is shown by performing an H-infinity control autopilot design for an F-16 aircraft. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A Hierarchical Vehicle Behavior Prediction Framework With Traffic Signals and Interactive Agents	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS												Vehicle behavior prediction in complex urban scenarios with traffic signals and interactive agents is an important yet complicated task for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this work, a hierarchical vehicle behavior prediction framework is proposed to incorporate the traffic signal information and model the interaction between vehicles. The framework predicts vehicle behaviors in two stages, discrete intention prediction and continuous trajectory prediction. In the discrete intention prediction stage, Bayesian network is adopted to provide a high-level behavior prediction of the principle other vehicle. The discrete prediction results are forwarded to the second stage, where a continuous trajectory is predicted with maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning and potential game. The framework is designed to be able to capture the difference among human drivers with parameterized driver characteristics. The proposed predictor is validated in two scenarios: the yellow light running scenario and the right-turn scenario. The trajectory prediction average displacement error of the yellow light running scenario is 0.695m for a 3-second prediction interval, and the prediction accuracy of the right-turn vehicle in the right-turn scenario is 0.51m for a 2-second prediction interval.

HoloHome integrates several technological paradigms such as Mixed Reality, Internet of Things, and Ambient Assisted Living to maximize the tailored domestic comfort for the Smart Home's inhabitants while promoting their comfort, safety, and independence in performing daily activities. It is designed and implemented on Microsoft HoloLens, ensuring the connection of the Mixed Reality environment with the distributed network of domestic sensors through the WiFi-enabled microcontrollers to present an innovative method of interaction with the Smart Home and IoT network. Additionally, HoloHome provides unique services and assistive technologies mainly designed for older adults and people with short-term memory deficits to provide continuous assistance, support, and instruction for household activities. This paper conducts the assessment of HoloHome, where the proposed system's usability, cybersickness, and effectiveness are investigated. The usability of HoloHome is validated on a sample of healthy adults to highlight desirable modifications before further assessments of older adults and people with disabilities.

J	Wang, MZ; Yao, JM				Wang, Mozhu; Yao, Jianming			Intertwined supply network design under facility and transportation disruption from the viability perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH												To ensure viability, it is necessary for an intertwined supply network (ISN) system to optimise network structure to provide flexible redundancy in response to changing environment. Considering resilience methods are usually designed as reactions to single discrete disruptions rather than situational reactions to real-time changes, this study proposes a novel redundancy optimisation approach dynamically providing each demand market with a pair of supply routes to optimise the flexible redundancy of ISN, thereby ensuring the survivability of supply chains and demand markets under continuous changes. Based on this, we propose the ISN design (ISND) model to capture the trade-off between total cost and viability performance under facility and transportation disruption. The Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, combined with the sub-gradient method and the improved cellular genetic algorithm, are utilised for solving problems of different scales. To test the performance of the model and corresponding algorithms, we also conduct a numerical analysis of the data from medical equipment ISN in southern China. The results indicate that the ISND model can effectively optimise ISN structures, which makes it possible to dynamically provide flexible redundancy; the two algorithms also show good calculation efficiency. The relationship between ISN structure and viability performance is thus observed and explained.																			0020-7543	1366-588X				APR 18	2023	61	8			SI		2513	2543		10.1080/00207543.2021.1930237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2021.1930237		MAY 2021											WOS:000654805000001

Patient Preferences for Provider Choice: A Discrete Choice Experiment	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE												OBJECTIVES: There is an ongoing policy discussion regarding an adequate breadth of provider networks. Health plans with "restricted networks" of providers have proved surprisingly popular on the Affordable Care Act health insurance exchanges because of a substantial gap in premiums between plans with open networks and closed networks. The objective of this paper is to assess which other attributes of the provider network matter to patients when choosing health insurance. STUDY DESIGN: We used a discrete choice experiment to analyze the effect of previously unobserved characteristics regarding provider networks on plan choice, including wait time, breadth, travel time, whether the plan covers care for their personal doctor, and monthly premium. Hypothetical plan options were offered to respondents of an online survey using Qualtrics software. METHODS: We used mixed multinomial logit models to estimate preference-based utilities for attributes of prima care provider networks and willingness to pay. RESULTS: Coverage of a personal doctor was the most important attribute, followed by premium, wait time to see a primary care provider, the breadth of the network, and travel time to the closest doctor covered by the plan. Respondents were willing to pay $95 per month to have a plan that covers care for their personal doctor, and they were willing to wait 6 days for an appointment to have a plan covering care for their personal. doctor. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide new insights to federal and state legislators developing new models or standards on network adequacy and patient decision support tools.

The objective is to achieve a desired density distribution over a simply connected spatial domain. Since individual agents in a swarm are not themselves of interest and we are concerned only with the macroscopic objective, we view the network of agents in the swarm as a discrete approximation of a continuous medium and design control laws to shape the density distribution of the continuous medium. The key feature of this work is that the agents in the swarm do not have access to position information. Each individual agent is capable of measuring the current local density of agents and can communicate with its spatial neighbors. The network of agents implement a Laplacian-based distributed algorithm, which we call pseudo-localization, to localize themselves in a new coordinate frame, and a distributed control law to converge to the desired spatial density distribution. We start by studying self-organization in one dimension, which is then followed by the 2D case.																			0363-0129	1095-7138					2018	56	5					3642	3667		10.1137/16M1080926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/16M1080926													WOS:000448810200021

Existing attributed network embedding models are designed in continuous Euclidean spaces which often introduce data redundancy and impose challenges to storage and computation casts. To this end, we present a Binarized Attributed Network Embedding model (BANE for short) to learn binary node representation. Specifically, we define a new Weisfeiler-Lehman proximity matrix to capture data dependence between node links and attributes by aggregating the information of node attributes and links from neighboring nodes to a given target node in a layer-wise manner. Based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman proximity matrix, we formulate a new Weisfiler-Lehman matrix factorization learning function under the binary node representation constraint. The learning problem is a mixed integer optimization and an efficient cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm is used as the solution. Node classification and link prediction experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed BANE model outperforms the state-of-the-art network embedding methods.

As for the cache-assisted vehicular NOMA-MEC networks, a problem of minimizing the energy consumed by vehicles (mobile devices, MDs) is formulated under time and resource constraints, which jointly optimize the computing resource allocation, subchannel selection, device association, offloading and caching decisions. To solve the formulated problem, we develop an effective joint computation offloading and task-caching algorithm based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. Such a TD3-based offloading (TD3O) algorithm includes a designed action transformation (AT) algorithm used for transforming continuous action space into a discrete one. In addition, to solve the formulated problem in a non-iterative manner, an effective heuristic algorithm (HA) is also designed. As for the designed algorithms, we provide some detailed analyses of computation complexity and convergence, and give some meaningful insights through simulation. Simulation results show that the TD3O algorithm could achieve lower local energy consumption than several benchmark algorithms, and HA could achieve lower consumption than the completely offloading algorithm and local execution algorithm.

For instance, the networks are typically unmanaged, most of IoT services are safety critical, the link layers are optimized for low power usage, and most nodes have to be implementable in a lightweight manner. In this paper are proposed model of IoT services as queue networks that will allow estimating the availability and safety of these systems.

The plant is assumed input-to-state stable with respect to measurement errors and the control law is updated once a triggering condition involving the norm of a measurement error is violated. The results are also extended to a self-triggered formulation, where the next control updates are decided at the previous ones, thus relaxing the need for continuous monitoring of the measurement error. The results are illustrated through simulated examples.

The network coverage and connectivity performances largely depend on the deployment method. In order to prolong the network lifespan, renewable energy was introduced to a part of the network nodes due to the cost issue. An improved energy aware deployment method is proposed in this paper. The aim of the paper is to maximize the network lifespan, lower the network cots, increase the energy utilization renewable energy nodes and balance the residual energy of the battery-power nodes. An energy consumption model was established in the consideration of deployment constraints over network coverage, connectivity, and stability. An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was designed to optimize the performance of the network model. A penalty function was included to resolve the problem which contain both continuous and discrete variables. The number of renewable nodes with the best cost-lifespan ratio was concluded. The simulation results demonstrate that the propose method increases the renewable energy utilization when the renewable energy source is good. Also the network keeps stable when the renewable energy source is off. The overall energy consumption of battery nodes were reduced and balanced. Therefore, the proposed deploy method prolong the network lifespan.																			1868-1646	1861-2121					2018	14	5					143	158		10.3991/ijoe.v14i05.8646	http://dx.doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v14i05.8646													WOS:000433292000012

To improve the generalization performance, an FNN with a multiobjective optimization algorithm (MOO-FNN) is proposed in this article. First, the multilevel learning objectives are designed around the generalization performance to guide the training process of an FNN. Then, the method utilizes the approximation error, the structure complexity, and the output smoothness indicators instead of a single indicator to improve the evaluation accuracy of generalization performance. Second, an MOO algorithm with continuous-discrete variables is developed to optimize the FNN. Then, MOO is able to use a novel particle update method to adjust both the structure and parameters rather than adjusting them separately, thereby achieving suitable generalization performance of the FNN. Third, the convergence of MOO-FNN is analyzed in detail to guarantee its successful applications. Finally, the experimental studies of MOO-FNN have been performed on model identification of nonlinear systems to verify the effectiveness. The results illustrate that MOO-FNN has a significant improvement over some state-of-the-art algorithms.

Different from the existing results, each agent of this system is controlled by switching control method. To achieve consensus in finite time for the switched MAS, two types of consensus protocols (the FTC protocol and the fixed-time consensus (FdTC) protocol) are proposed. By using algebraic graph theory, Lyapunov theory and matrix theory, it is proved that the FTC problem in strongly connected network and leader-following network can be solved, respectively. When the initial states of agents are not available, the FdTC protocol is applied to solve the FTC problem. Simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.					zheng, yuan/JCN-7781-2023														2168-2216	2168-2232				JUL	2017	47	7					1535	1545		10.1109/TSMC.2016.2631659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2631659													WOS:000404354600041

In this article, we present a real-life application of wireless sensor networks in trains to monitor the goods conditions in a long-distance transportation. We study the wireless sensor network deployment problem in developing a monitoring system with the goal of maximizing the network lifetime under constraints derived from the real application scenario. The key technical problem to solve is to determine the sensor placement and the transmission level for each sensor node, as well as the appropriate number of sensor nodes. We first formulate the problem with a realistic discrete power model as a mixed integer linear programming problem. Then, a two-step efficient deployment heuristic is proposed to satisfy these constraints step by step. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed heuristic performs almost the same as the optimal mixed integer linear programming solution. Moreover, the wireless sensor network with appropriate number of nodes can improve its lifetime up to 10.6% for a train with 80 boxcars. We also discussed a tested experiment in a laboratory environment, as well as the real implementation of the whole monitoring system.																			1550-1477					MAY 14	2017	13	5								10.1177/1550147717707895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1550147717707895													WOS:000401558300001

As a starting point, we focus on shortest path multi-interdictor (SPMI) games , where multiple interdictors try to increase the shortest path lengths of their own adversaries attempting to traverse a common network. We first establish results regarding the existence of equilibria for SPMI games under both discrete and continuous interdiction strategies. To compute such an equilibrium, we present a reformulation of the SPMI game, which leads to a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) with non-shared constraints. While such a problem is computationally challenging in general, we show that under continuous interdiction actions, an SPMI game can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem and solved by Lemke's algorithm. In addition, we present decentralized heuristic algorithms based on best response dynamics for games under both continuous and discrete interdiction strategies. Finally, we establish theoretical lower bounds on the worst-case efficiency loss of equilibria in SPMI games, with such loss caused by the lack of coordination among noncooperative interdictors, and use the decentralized algorithms to numerically study the average-case efficiency loss.

Discretization and event triggered digital output feedback control of LPV systems	SYSTEMS & CONTROL LETTERS												This paper investigates the problem of discretization and digital output feedback control design for continuous-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems subject to a time-varying networked-induced delay. The proposed discretization procedure converts a continuous-time LPV system into an equivalent discrete-time LPV system based on an extension of the Taylor series expansion and using an event-based sampling. The scheduling parameters are continuously measured and modeled as piecewise constant. A new transmission of the measured output to the controller is triggered by significant changes in the parameters, yielding time-varying transmission intervals. The obtained discretized model has matrices with polynomial dependence on the time-varying parameters and an additive norm-bounded term representing the discretization residual error. A two step strategy based on linear matrix inequality conditions is then proposed to synthesize a digital static scheduled output feedback control law that stabilizes both the discretized and the LPV model. The conditions can also be used to provide robust (i.e., independent of the scheduling parameter) static output feedback controllers. The viability of the proposed design method is illustrated through numerical examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Network layer communication protocol design for underwater agriculture farming	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS												In recent times, underwater agriculture farming is seen as a viable alternative to land-based farming by agricultural scientists due to increasing limitations in land-based farming areas around the world. But farming underwater is not as easy as it is said. Continuous monitoring of different parameters of the water inside the biosphere where the herbs, crops, and plants are cultivated is one of the highest priorities for the effective outcome in underwater farming. To achieve such precise monitoring, sensor-based data collection from the underwater biosphere is the only way. Employing human divers for monitoring of water parameters has many limitations such as diving time, accidents due to harsh underwater environment. Alternatively, adopting sensor-based monitoring provides spatial and temporal flexibility. But one of the significant challenges of such an underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) is ensuring reliable communication between the underwater sensors and surface station. To ensure reliable delivery of sensed information network layer operation is vital. The underwater environment has unique challenges such as high interference, harsh environment, limited lifetime, and short network lifetime the network layer protocols of terrestrial networks can't be adopted into the underwater environment. So this research focuses on the development of a mathematical model for network layer communication using stochastic network calculus (SNC) taking into consideration the requirements of underwater agriculture farming application. In this research, the delay and backlog bounds of the proposed model are derived. The proposed mathematical model is also evaluated for its correctness using the discrete event simulation.

As many of these systems are typically self-powered, their circuits are expected to be resilient and efficient in the presence of continuous power variations caused by the harvesters. In this paper, we propose a novel mixed-signal (i.e. analogue/digital) approach of designing a power-elastic perceptron using the principle of pulse width modulation (PWM). Fundamental to the design are a number of parallel inverters that transcode the input-weight pairs based on the principle of PWM duty cycle. Since PWM-based inverters are typically agnostic to amplitude and frequency variations, the perceptron shows a high degree of power elasticity and robustness under these variations. We show extensive design analysis in Cadence Analog Design Environment tool using a 3 x 3 perceptron circuit as a case study to demonstrate the resilience in the presence of parameric variations.

Based on the Generative adversarial network, this paper proposes a painting image conversion algorithm for multi class scenes. It performs deep feature extraction in the residual module, divides the encoding and decoding parts of the generator into functional parts, and designs them separately. The mixed attention module is inserted into the decoder and encoder to preserve the texture details of the image. The deep network interpolation is incorporated to achieve smooth and continuous conversion of the painting image. The experiment showed that the loss value of the research method decreases to 0.008 after 400 iterations during the loss value testing. Its maximum peak signal-to-noise ratio is 34.9dB when the bit rate increases to 1000kb/s. In the SAR image conversion dataset, the F1 value increases to 97.4 after 200 iterations. The pixel loss when it reaches 100% conversion in outdoor images is 5.38k. The data indicates that the research method has good performance in painting image conversion and can provide effective technical references for image conversion.																			2169-3536						2023	11						123242	123252		10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3329130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3329130													WOS:001103057800001

Firstly, a fractional integral sliding surface which is suitable for the considered FO error system is proposed. Second, in terms of the established sliding surface, combining a novel reaching law, a new adaptive sliding mode control law is introduced, which can force the closed-loop dynamic error system trajectories to reach the sliding surface. Then, by giving a continuous frequency distributed model of the FO dynamic networks and the application of FO system stability theory, the projective synchronization conditions are addressed in terms of linear matrix inequality techniques. Based on the conditions, a desired controller which can guarantee the robust stability of the closed-loop system and also ensure a mixed H/passive performance level is designed. Finally, synchronization of two nonidentical time-delayed FO T-S fuzzy neural networks with uncertain parameters as a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

As important functional subsystems of LoC, microfluidic reaction systems can significantly reduce the need for space, materials, and energy, and often have shorter response times. Iterative design studies require accurate and fast models for subsystems. Here, we present two PFR-network-based models and a method of lines model for reaction subsystems. These two models employ two different discretization methods to reduce the set of PDEs into a system of coupled ODEs. We use our model to analyze an example micro mixing-reaction system.

A major challenge for ISAC systems is that the constraint introduced by sensing functionality will constrain the degrees of freedom in waveform design and results in large multi-user interference (MUI), thus degrading the communication performance. In this paper, we study the employment of RIS in mitigating MUI in ISAC systems. For practical consideration, we investigate joint constant-modulus waveform and discrete RIS phase shift design, with the aim of minimizing MUI under the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraint for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem, and two schemes are proposed to deal with the discrete RIS phase shifts.

Flexible and efficient simulation-based inference for models of decision-making	ELIFE												Inferring parameters of computational models that capture experimental data are a central task in cognitive neuroscience. Bayesian statistical inference methods usually require the ability to evaluate the likelihood of the model-however, for many models of interest in cognitive neuroscience, the associated likelihoods cannot be computed efficiently. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a solution to this problem by only requiring access to simulations produced by the model. Previously, Fengler et al. introduced likelihood approximation networks (LANs, Fengler et al., 2021) which make it possible to apply SBI to models of decision-making, but require billions of simulations for training. Here, we provide a new SBI method that is substantially more simulation efficient. Our approach, mixed neural likelihood estimation (MNLE), trains neural density estimators on model simulations to emulate the simulator, and is designed to capture both the continuous (e.g., reaction times) and discrete (choices) data of decision-making models. The likelihoods of the emulator can then be used to perform Bayesian parameter inference on experimental data using standard approximate inference methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We demonstrate MNLE on two variants of the drift-diffusion model and show that it is substantially more efficient than LANs: MNLE achieves similar likelihood accuracy with six orders of magnitude fewer training simulations, and is significantly more accurate than LANs when both are trained with the same budget. Our approach enables researchers to perform SBI on custom-tailored models of decision-making, leading to fast iteration of model design for scientific discovery.

In this work, we present a neural network model to automatically learn the capabilities of discrete manufacturing processes such as machining and finishing from design and manufacturing data. Concatenating a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) with an artificial neural network, the combined model can learn the part shape and part quality generation capabilities of the manufacturing processes. Specifically, the proposed method takes the voxelized part geometry and part quality information as inputs and utilizes a mixed neural network model (3D CNN + artificial neural network) to predict the manufacturing process label as output. The manufacturing process capability knowledge embedded in the neural network model is scalable and updatable as new manufacturing data becomes available. We present an example implementation of the proposed method with a synthesized manufacturing dataset to illustrate how the method enables automatic manufacturing process selection. The high prediction accuracy shows its predictive strength for use in Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP).																					978-0-7918-8621-2				2022									V002T02A010															WOS:001219208300010

First, a game theoretic framework is established for auction-driven dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. The utility functions and bidding strategies of heterogeneous secondary users are defined, and the parameterized auction mechanisms of primary user are also introduced. Then, we formulate the auction-driven dynamic spectrum access problem as a finite discrete game with a mixed- or pure-strategy Nash equilibrium solution. We study the existence and uniqueness properties of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the defined game. Next, we propose a distributed learning automata algorithm (DLA) to attain the Nash equilibrium of the defined game with limited feedback. The adaptive mechanism design is realized in the updating procedure of our DLA algorithm. We further prove that our DLA algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium of the defined game. Finally, simulation results show that our DLA algorithm is efficient and outperforms the dynamic spectrum access schemes with fixed auction mechanism.

In order to obtain an accurate and faithful model, a new identification scheme for singularly perturbed nonlinear system using multitime-scale recurrent high order neural networks (NNs) is proposed in this paper. Inspired by the optimal bounded ellipsoid algorithm, which is originally designed for discrete-time systems, a novel weight updating law is developed for continuous-time NNs identification process. Compared with other widely used gradient-descent updating algorithms, this new method can achieve faster convergence, due to its adaptively adjusted learning rate. Based on the identification results, a control scheme using singular perturbation theories is developed. By using singular perturbation methods, the system order is reduced, and the controller structure is simplified. The closed-loop stability is analyzed and the convergence of system states is guaranteed. The effectiveness of the identification and the control scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.

Different from time-differentiation operation for continuous-time systems leading to linear input dependence of output dynamics in the process of feedback linearization, time-advance operation for discrete-time non-canonical form neural network systems results in nonlinear input dependence of output dynamics, which brings a difficulty to specify explicit relative degrees. In order to solve this problem, this paper derives new results for relative degrees of such systems using the implicit function theory, based on which a normal form is derived. Based on the normal form, the paper develops a feedback control scheme for systems with implicit relative degrees. A detailed design procedure using implicit function theory is derived to ensure stable precise output tracking. A numerical solution algorithm is also given to ensure stable output tracking with any degree of accuracy. Simulation results are shown to show effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

J	Fang, TT; Zhu, F; Chen, J				Fang, Tingting; Zhu, Fei; Chen, Jie			Hyperspecral Unmixing Based on Multilinear Mixing Model Using Convolutional Autoencoders	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Unsupervised spectral unmixing (SU) consists of representing each observed pixel as a combination of several pure materials known as endmembers, along with their corresponding abundance fractions. Beyond the linear assumption, various nonlinear unmixing models have been proposed, with the associated optimization problems solved either by traditional optimization algorithms or deep learning techniques. Current deep-learning-based nonlinear unmixing mainly focuses on additive, bilinear-based formulations. The multilinear mixing model (MLM) offers a unique perspective by interpreting the reflection process by discrete Markov chains, allowing it to account for the interactions between endmembers up to infinite order. However, explicitly simulating the physics of MLM using neural networks has remained a challenging problem. In this article, we propose a novel autoencoder (AE)-based network for unsupervised unmixing based on MLM. Leveraging an elaborate network design, this approach explicitly models the relationships among all model parameters: endmembers, abundances, and transition probability. The network operates in two modes: MLM-1DAE, which considers only pixelwise spectral information, and MLM-3DAE, which explores spectral-spatial correlations within input patches. Experiments on both the synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating competitive performance compared with classic MLM-based solutions.

J	Xu, J; Guo, CC; Zhang, H				Xu, Jun; Guo, Chengcheng; Zhang, Hao			Joint channel allocation and power. control based on PSO for cellular networks with D2D communications	COMPUTER NETWORKS												Introducing D2D communications into wireless cellular networks is viewed as a potential method to relieve the increasing traffic in the base stations. However, the cellular users will suffer from high interference without efficient interference management scheme. In this paper, we study two joint channel allocation and power control problems with different constraints, and propose a joint channel allocation and power control scheme based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to efficiently manage interference and improve the network throughput. The proposed scheme deals with continuous powers and discrete channels simultaneously. By carefully designing the fitness values for the two problems, the algorithm avoids trapping into infeasible solutions. Numerous simulations show that the proposed algorithm could improve the network throughput in cellular networks with D2D communications, and the algorithm outperforms the compared non-joint interference management algorithm in terms of D2D throughput, cellular throughput, and further the overall network throughput.

The original problem, being formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, takes into consideration the availability of different energy sources, the installation and operation of hydrogen facilities of different sizes and technologies, and the transportation of hydrogen from production units to storage facilities. The area of study is divided into grids which have a specific hydrogen demand that evolves over time, thus a multi-period model of the HSC is considered. In order to overcome the computational burden associated to the solution of large size instances of the resulting problem, we proposed a solution strategy consisting of a hybrid algorithm. The original problem is reformulated into a bi-level optimization problem: the upper level (discrete problem) consists of finding the optimal location for production plants and storage facilities, whereas the lower level (continuous problem) minimizes their corresponding costs associated to transportation and facility operation. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is employed for the solution of the bi-objective upper level, whereas the bi-objective lower level is decomposed using a scalarizing function, which is then solved using a linear programming solver. The proposed methodology is validated through the comparison of the true Pareto fronts given by CPLEX with epsilon-constraint method, for six increasing size instances. Numerical results prove that the proposed hybrid approach produces an accurate approximation of the Pareto-optimal fronts, more efficiently than the exact solution approach. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bütün, C; Petrovic, S; Muyldermans, L				Butun, Cihan; Petrovic, Sanja; Muyldermans, Luc			The capacitated directed cycle hub location and routing problem under congestion	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												This paper deals with hub-and-spoke network design in the liner shipping sector. It introduces a capacitated directed cycle hub location and cargo routing problem under congestion. The problem involves four decisions: location of hub ports; allocation of non-hub ports to hub ports; construction of a directed cyclic route at the hub port network level; and the routing of cargo between all origin-destination demand pairs in the network. The objective is to minimize the cost which includes fixed hub opening, feeder collection and distribution, inter-hub transportation, cargo handling, and non-linear hub port congestion costs. We present a mixed integer linear programming model in which the non-linear congestion costs at the hub ports are approximated through a (semi-continuous) piecewise linear function and use this model to calculate lower bounds on the objective function. We also develop a Tabu Search algorithm, which employs a hierarchical approach for the different decisions in the hub-and-spoke network design problem, with customized procedures for the generation of the initial solution and the selection of the search moves. The neighborhood search is diversified by randomly changing the locations of hubs based on their location frequency history in previous solutions. Computational experiments, using instances from the literature and problems based on real-world data, demonstrate that the algorithm finds high quality solutions in a reasonable time. The experiments show that the network design can be highly influenced by scale economies in mainline vs. feeder transportation costs, the port locations and hinterland flows, and congestion at the hub ports.

Role detection in bicycle-sharing networks using multilayer stochastic block models	NETWORK SCIENCE												In urban systems, there is an interdependency between neighborhood roles and transportation patterns between neighborhoods. In this paper, we classify docking stations in bicycle-sharing networks to gain insight into the human mobility patterns of three major cities in the United States. We propose novel time-dependent stochastic block models, with degree-heterogeneous blocks and either mixed or discrete block membership, which classify nodes based on their time-dependent activity patterns. We apply these models to (1) detect the roles of bicycle-sharing stations and (2) describe the traffic within and between blocks of stations over the course of a day. Our models successfully uncover work blocks, home blocks, and other blocks; they also reveal activity patterns that are specific to each city. Our work gives insights for the design and maintenance of bicycle-sharing systems, and it contributes new methodology for community detection in temporal and multilayer networks with heterogeneous degrees.																			2050-1242	2050-1250				MAR	2022	10	1					46	81		10.1017/nws.2021.21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/nws.2021.21													WOS:000784754800001

A novel intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS) assisted SGF NOMA transmission system is proposed, where the IRS is employed to satisfy the channel gain requirements for grant-based users (GBUs) and grant-free users (GFUs). The dynamic optimization on the sub-carrier assignment and power allocation for roaming GFUs, and the amplitude control and phase shift design for reflecting elements of the IRS, is formulated. Aiming at maximizing the long-term data rate of all GFUs, the optimization problem is first modeled as a multi-agent Markov decision problem. Then, three multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based frameworks are proposed to solve the problem under three different IRS cases, including the ideal IRS, non-ideal IRS with continuous phase shifts, and non-ideal IRS with discrete phase shifts. Specifically, for each GFU agent, a sub-carrier assignment deep Q-network (DQN) and a power allocation deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) are integrated to dynamically assign network resources for each GFU. For the only IRS agent, two DDPGs are integrated to dynamically assign phase shift and amplitude for each reflecting element of ideal IRS. The single DDPG for dynamically assigning continuous phase shifts, and parallel DQNs for dynamically assigning discrete phase shifts for non-ideal IRS with fixed amplitude are also proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) The network sum rates of all GFUs can achieve a significant improvement with the aid of IRS, comparing with the system without IRS. 2) The network sum rates of the NOMA assisted SGF transmissions are superior to that of OMA assisted GF transmissions.					chen, xian/KHW-2227-2024	Guo, Liang/0009-0007-5691-9314													0733-8716	1558-0008				APR	2022	40	4					1302	1316		10.1109/JSAC.2022.3144726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2022.3144726													WOS:000769993400020

The objective of this paper is to identify which of these mechanisms are the most relevant, and how they can be theoretically and empirically combined into discrete alternative modes of organizational coordination between firms. A framework is developed for evaluating the comparative effectiveness and efficiency of these combinations of coordination mechanisms in the regulation of different types of inter-firm interdependence, drawing on both organization theory and organization economics. By analyzing network forms as mixes of coordination mechanisms, the framework offers a typology of inter-firm organization forms that is much more fine-grained and conducive to network organization design than those previously available. The predictive power of the framework is demonstrated by using the vast empirical research available on various types of networks, showing its capacity to explain the main findings on the use of different network forms for governing different types of relations.																			0170-8406	1741-3044					1997	18	6					897	925		10.1177/017084069701800601	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/017084069701800601													WOS:000071806400001

IoT devices collect, store, analyze, and act upon a continuous stream of data as a by-product of everyday use. However, IoT devices need unrestricted data access to fully function. As such, they invade users' virtual and physical space and raise far-reaching privacy challenges that are unlike those examined in other contexts. As advanced IoT devices, connected cars offer a unique setting to review and extend established theory and evidence on privacy and data sharing. Employing a sequential mixed methods design, we conducted an interview study (n=120), a survey study (n=333), and a field experiment (n=324) among car drivers to develop and validate a contextualized model of individuals' data sharing decisions. Our findings from the three studies highlight the interplay between virtual and physical risks in shaping drivers' privacy concerns and data sharing decisions-with information privacy and data security emerging as discrete yet closely interrelated concepts. Our findings also highlight the importance of psychological ownership, conceptualized as drivers' feelings of possession toward their driving data, as an important addition to established privacy calculus models of data sharing. This novel perspective explains why individuals are reluctant to share even low-sensitivity data that do not raise privacy concerns. The psychological ownership perspective has implications for designing incentives for data-enabled services in ways that augment drivers' self-efficacy and psychological ownership and thereby encourage them to share driving data. These insights help reconcile a fundamental tension among IoT users-how to avail the benefits of data enabled IoT devices while reducing the psychological costs associated with the sharing of personal data.

This device is based on a discrete-time learning-threshold element model of the neuron, utilizing a ''Fourier series signal,'' into whose Fourier coefficients information is loaded. Hebbian learning, membrane potential learning, correlation learning, error-correction learning, and orthogonal learning can be applied to this element. The GH-folthret has the following advantages: (1) only two lines are needed for input; (2) calculation of the sum of the weighted input signals and changes of the connection weights are easily performed; (3) no matter how complicated the network is, it can be realized with simple wiring. In addition, changes in the network can also be made without difficulty. An additional advantage is that the learning method can be changed easily. Accordingly, the GH-folthret has the advantage of allowing a neural computer to be implemented electronically. Examples of the realization of three kinds of networks, (interconnected, multilayered, and mixed) with GH-folthrets are presented.																			0882-1666					NOV 1	1994	25	13					37	46																WOS:A1994QV57100004

Given the large-scale network structure of these sites, disruptions in any of its nodes, or individual chemical processes, can propagate and disrupt the operation of the whole network. Random process failures that reduce or shut down production capacity are among the most common disruptions. The impact of such disruptive events can be mitigated by adding parallel units and/or intermediate storage. In this paper, we address the design of large-scale, integrated sites considering random process failures. In a previous work (Terrazas-Moreno et al., 2010), we proposed a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to maximize the average production capacity of an integrated site while minimizing the required capital investment. The present work deals with the solution of large-scale problem instances for which a strategy is proposed that consists of two elements. On one hand, we use Benders decomposition to overcome the combinatorial complexity of the MILP model. On the other hand, we exploit discrete-rate simulation tools to obtain a relevant reduced sample of failure scenarios or states. We first illustrate this strategy in a small example. Next, we address an industrial case study where we use a detailed simulation model to assess the quality of the design obtained from the MILP model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the network, one cellular link and multiple device-to-device (D2D) links sharing the same spectrum resources combine direct and reflective channel transmissions with the assistance of the RIS, which is adopted to alleviate the interference by fully using the beamforming capability. Subjected to quality-of-service (QoS) and total power constraints, a system sumrate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing transmission powers of all links and discrete phase shifts of all RIS elements. Since it is a mixed integer non-convex non-linear problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, and apply the alternating optimization to obtain a sub-optimal solution efficiently. For the power allocation sub-problem, it is a difference of concave functions (DC) problem, which is transformed to a convex one by the multivariate Taylor expansion and then solved with the gradient descent method. For the phase shift subproblem, a local search algorithm is utilized.

It describes the architectural and design decisions as well as the data sources, development tools and processes in each of the three simulation domains - System Dynamics (SD), Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). The encompassing model uses a network of SD models, each representing a 30 km(2) grid cell of Earth's surface, with attributes describing population density as well as economic, political, sanitary and healthcare capabilities. Governments and outbreak response teams are represented by software agents, making decisions about resource allocations and performing vaccination drives. A discrete event engine drives the SD models and the agents, as well as any prescribed response actions. Where possible - and it was almost always possible - Open Source data and software is used.																			0891-7736		978-1-7281-3283-9				2019							1103	1113																WOS:000529791401006

However, it is desirable to be able to design applications and reason about the data in more abstract forms than in points of data. By bestowing the ability to predict inter-node values upon the network, it is proposed that it will become possible to build applications that are unaware of the concrete reality of sparse data. This interpolation capability is realised as a service of the network. In this paper, the map' style of presentation has been identified as a suitable sense data visualisation format. Although map generation is essentially a problem of interpolation between points, a new WSN service, called the map generation service, which is based on a Shepard interpolation method, is presented. A modified Shepard method that aims to deal with the special characteristics of WSNs is proposed. It requires small storage, can be localised and integrates the information about the application domain to further reduce the map generation cost and improve the mapping accuracy. Empirical analysis has shown that the map generation service is an accurate, a flexible and an efficient method. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Wu, Y; Wu, YP				Wu, Ying; Wu, Yanpeng			Mode-dependent robust stability and stabilisation of uncertain networked control systems via an average dwell time switching approach	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												The stability analysis and synthesis problem of networked control systems (NCSs) with communication limits and system uncertainties is investigated via an average dwell time switching control method. Active time-varying sampling strategy and hybrid node driven mode are proposed to generate a series of one-step time delay subsystems of closed-loop NCS. Gridding approach is introduced to transform the continuous time axis into discrete time sequences which limits the switching rules in a finite set. By constructing multiple parameter-dependent quadratic Lyapunov-like functions with norm bounded uncertainties, sufficient stability conditions are derived and the robust mode-dependent network controller is designed to guarantee the proposed uncertain switched NCS globally asymptotically stable for any switching signal with admissible ADT. A for-loop algorithm is integrated into the formulated LMI optimisation problem to avoid predefining the switching sequence and the occurring times of network induced factors. Finally, simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

The plant is a continuous-time system, which is sampled by time-varying random sampling periods. A general delta domain Lyapunov stability criterion is given for delta operator switched systems with time delays. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of closed-loop networked control systems with both packets dropout and network-induced delays are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A verification theorem is given to show the solvability of the stabilization conditions by solving a class of finite LMIs. Both the case of data packets arrive instantly and the case of invariant sampling periods in delta operator systems are given, respectively. Three numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the developed techniques. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Process Optimization Using a Hybrid Disjunctive-Genetic Programming Approach	DESIGN FOR ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT					7th International Conference on the Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design (FOCAPD)	JUN 07-12, 2009	Breckenridge, CO	Natl Sci Fdn, ASPEN Technol, Eastman Chemical Co, Taylor & Francis Grp LLC				Discrete optimization problems, which give rise to the conditional modeling of equations through representations as logic based disjunctions, are very important and often appear in all scales of chemical engineering process network design and synthesis. With the increase in the problem scale, dealing with such alternating routes becomes difficult due to increased computational load and possible entanglement of the results in sub-optimal solutions due to infeasibilities in the MILP space. In this work, Disjunctive-Genetic Programming (D-GP), based on the integration of Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the disjunctive formulations of the Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) for the optimization of process networks, is presented. The genetic algorithm is used as a jumping operator to the different terms of the discrete search space and for the generation of different feasible fixed configurations. This proposed approach eliminates the need for the reformulation of the discrete/discontinous optimization problems into direct MINLP problems, thus allowing for the solution of the original problem as a continuous optimization problem but only at each individual discrete and reduced search space.

The NDP is often cast in a bilevel programming problem which is known to be NP-hard. In this study, we tackle a special case of the NDP where the decision variables are integers. A variety of exact solutions has been proposed for the discrete NDP, but due to the combinatorial complexity, the literature has yet to address the problem for large-size networks, and accounting for the multimodal and multiclass traffic flows. To this end, the bilevel problem is solved by branch-and-bound. At each node of the search tree, a valid lower bound based on system optimal (SO) traffic flow is calculated. The SO traffic flow is formulated as a mixed integer, non-linear programming (MINLP) problem for which the Benders decomposition method is used. The algorithm is coded on a hybrid and synchronized platform consisting of MATLAB (optimization engine), EMME 3 (transport planning module), MS Access (database), and MS Excel (user interface). The proposed methodology is applied to three examples including Gao's network, the Sioux-Falls network, and a real size network representing the city of Winnipeg, Canada. Numerical tests on the network of Winnipeg at various budget levels have shown promising results.

Although a DT-PLN can predict the long-term behavior of a GRN, using it to describe the transient kinetics at the microtimescale level remains inconvenient. In this article, we investigate the problems associated with the stability and stabilization of continuous-time probabilistic logic networks (CT-PLNs). First, we demonstrate that the concept of finite-time stability for DT-PLNs cannot be extended to CT-PLNs owing to the nonsingularity of transitional probability matrices. Thus, we introduce the concept of asymptotical stability, which is defined as the convergence in distribution of the network state. Second, by developing the theory of invariant subsets for CT-PLNs, a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotical stability with respect to a subset is proposed, which is expressed in terms of the transition rate matrix of probability. Third, for a CT-PLN with input nodes, termed a continuous-time probabilistic logic control network, we discuss the subsets that are invariant under piece-wise constant input. Based thereupon, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition under which asymptotically stabilizing sampled-data feedback exists. A method for designing sampled-data feedback is proposed. Last, Monte Carlo simulation algorithms are proposed to efficiently simulate a CT-PLN in the time domain. Examples are provided to demonstrate the methods proposed in this article.					liu, yang/HIU-0559-2022; Liu, Yajuan/HPH-1187-2023; LIU, YANG/HWQ-4615-2023; Liu, Yang/HNJ-6693-2023; liu, yang/HHY-8583-2022; liu, yang/HQY-7531-2023														0018-9286	1558-2523				JAN	2022	67	1					279	291		10.1109/TAC.2021.3063130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2021.3063130													WOS:000735567400023

Our aim is to maximize the system sum data rate via jointly designing beamforming and user association. The problem is basically a mixed integer non-convex programs for which a global solution requires a prohibitively high computational effort. The focus is thus on efficient solutions capable of achieving the near optimal performance with low complexity. To this end, we transform the design problem into continuous programs by two approaches: penalty and sparse approximation methods. The resulting continuous nonconvex problems are then solved by the successive convex approximation framework. Numerical results indicate that the proposed methods are near-optimal, and outperform existing suboptimal methods in terms of achieved performances and computational complexity.

While digital circuits use discrete voltage levels, analog circuits use a continuous range of voltage. The synthesis of analog circuits is known to be a complex optimization task, clue to the continuous behaviour of the output and the lack of automatic design tools; actually, the design process is almost entirely demanded to the engineers. In this research work, we introduce a new clonal selection algorithm, the elitist Immune Programming (EIP), which uses a new class of hypermutation operators and a network-based coding. The El P algorithm is designed for the synthesis of topology and sizing of analog electrical circuits; in particular, it has been used for the design of passive filters. To assess the effectiveness of the designed algorithm, the obtained results have been compared with the passive filter discovered by Koza and co-authors using the Genetic Programming (GP). The circuits obtained by EIP algorithm are better than the one found by GP in terms of frequency response and number of components required to build it.

To establish the exponential convergence of the observer, in this paper, we model the impact of the sampling uncertainty by a reset integrator. First, generic conditions for stability of a sampled data system are recalled. Second it is shown how to derive tractable numerical conditions to analyze the robustness of a continuous-time Luenberger observer when the sampling is discrete and time-varying. Then it is demonstrated that this emulation approach can be passed over allowing for the direct computation of an observer gain.

However, most summary videos are composed of multiple key components. If the selection of some video frames changes during the training process, the information carried by these frames may not be reasonably reflected in the identification results. In this paper, we propose a video summarization method based on selecting keyframes over GANs. The novelty of the proposed method is the discriminator not only identifies the completeness of the video, but also takes into account the value judgment of the candidate keyframes, thus enabling the influence of keyframes on the result value. Given GANs are mainly designed to generate continuous real values, it is generally challenging to generate discrete symbol sequences during the summarization process directly. However, if the generated sample is based on discrete symbols, the slight guidance change of the discrimination network may be meaningless. To better use the advantages of GANs, the study also adopts the video summarization optimization method of GANs under a collaborative reinforcement learning strategy. Experimental results show the proposed method gets a significant summarization effect and character compared with the existing cutting-edge methods.																			1392-124X						2023	52	1					185	198		10.5755/j01.itc.52.1.32278	http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.itc.52.1.32278													WOS:000976548300013

Under the framework of Filippov solutions, with the help of the definition of robust fixed-time synchronization, functional differential inclusions theory and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, two fixed-time synchronization schemes are established for the proposed master-slave neural networks via two different discontinuous control laws, and the design parameters can be selected by some delay-dependent inequalities. Besides, the settling times of the two fixed-time synchronization are provided in advance. In sharp contrast to the existed results which can only finite-timely synchronize or fixed-timely synchronize systems with continuous activation functions and without uncertain external perturbations, the theoretical results of this paper are more general and rigorous.

Towards synthesis of an optimal thermal cracking reactor	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN												To develop new reactor options for thermal cracking of ethane or other light hydrocarbons to lower olefins a fundamental process synthesis approach is taken. Firstly, an optimal reaction path and conditions are targeted, starting from a mechanistic reaction network. Secondly, to implement the optimal reaction path the reactor geometry and equipment are designed. This contribution focuses on the development of a targeting approach, for which a new distributive reaction-mixing synthesis model is formulated and applied. The mixing kernel in the model provides freedom to redistribute the reaction mixture along a continuous reaction coordinate to optimize product yield. The model was validated for two applications. It reproduces the results for the Van de Vusse reaction network as obtained by the attainable region theory. When applied to a small reaction network for the conversion of ethane into ethylene, it reconfirms the existing result that for this network the plug flow mode at maximum temperature and minimum pressure gives the optimal olefin yield.

In this paper, we investigate the classification of pottery shards, a key enabler to understand how the agriculture was introduced from the Fertile Crescent to Europe. Our purpose is to jointly design the measuring radar system and the classification neural network, seeking the maximal compactness and the minimal cost, both directly related to the number of sensors. We aim to select the least possible number of sensors and place them adequately, while minimizing the false recognition rate. For this, we propose a novel version of the Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer, designed to reduce the number of sensors, and a Ternary Grey Wolf Optimizer. Together with the Continuous Grey Wolf Optimizer, they yield the CBTGWO (Continuous Binary Ternary Grey Wolf Optimizer). Working with 7 frequencies and starting with 37 sensors, the CBTGWO selects a single sensor and yields a 0-valued false recognition rate. In a single-frequency scenario, starting with 217 sensors, the CBTGWO selects 2 sensors. The false recognition rate is 2%. The acquisition time is 3.2 s, outperforming the GWO and adaptive mixed GWO, which yield 86.4 and 396.6 s.																				1424-8220				MAY	2024	24	9							2749	10.3390/s24092749	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s24092749								38732855					WOS:001219961900001

Turning on and off the production of proteins on demand holds great promise for creating significant biotechnological and biomedical applications. With successful stories already registered, the challenge still lies with rationally engineering gene regulatory networks which, like electronic circuits, sense inputs and generate desired outputs. From the literature, we have found kinetic and thermodynamic information describing the molecular components and interactions of the transcriptionally repressing lac, tet, and ara operons. Connecting these components in a model gene network, we determine how to change the kinetic parameters to make this normally nonperiodic system one which has well-defined oscillations. Simulating the designed lac-tet-ara gene network using a hybrid stochastic-discrete and stochastic-continuous algorithm, we seek to elucidate the relationship between the strength and type of specific connections in the gene network and the oscillatory nature of the protein product. Modeling the molecular components of the gene network allows the simulation to capture the dynamics of the real biological system. Analyzing the effect of modi. cations at this level provides the ability to predict how changes to experimental systems will alter the network behavior, while saving the time and expense of trial and error experimental modi. cations.

As a consequence, it is necessary to investigate uniform ultimate boundedness which is a mild stability property. In this paper, we address event-triggered H0,0 control for discrete-time linear parameter-varying systems by jointly designing a mixed event-triggering mechanism and a set of state feedback controllers. In the frame of time-delay system, we propose a parameter-dependent sufficient condition such that the closed-loop system with mixed event-triggering mechanism is globally uniformly ultimately bounded with a minimized ultimate bound for a certain disturbance attenuation level. As an extensive study, such sufficient condition is proved to be in a sense of global asymptotic stability when the additional threshold tends to zero. To avoid the infinite dimensional optimization problem, the proposed parameter-dependent co-design condition is relaxed as a finite set of linear matrix inequalities at the polytope vertices, which can be numerically trackable and computationally efficient. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2015 The Franldin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to their complexity, controllability is generally hard to achieve in hybrid automata, although it is a desirable property of engineered systems. In the present paper, we assess a novel model class of controllable deterministic hybrid automata, which we call Flat Hybrid Automata. This model class is based on the concept of differential flatness for the nonlinear continuous dynamics and on the property of determinism and controllability for the discrete event dynamics. We review the formal definition and we give the respective conditions and a proof for its controllability. An electrical network example illustrates the methodology and shows its potential regarding modelling, control and system design.

Whatever approach is chosen, the modeling scheme always follows the same pattern from the generation of the 3D geometry to the analysis of the simulation results. However there are no generic tools that allow for designing a physical model independently from the approach. This yields to the development of specific tools that are not reusable and that do not facilitate the comparison between methods. In this article we propose a framework that takes into account every step of the modeling process, and that can be used for any type of approach. We define an extensible language to represent both continuous and discrete physical models as well as a language to define constraints and loads to be applied during simulation. The usability of this generic framework is shown through two examples.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a discrete-time barrier Lyapunov function based controller for human-robot interaction in constrained task space to guarantee control performance. The Euler discrete-time stability of closedloop system controlled by the proposed method is proved, and a feasible difference scheme to support the stability analysis is uncovered based on monotonic scaling. The parameter dependence of this study is well discussed, which involves sample interval and preset boundary of state constraints, and based on the architecture of barrier Lyapunov function, the dependence relationship is demonstrated by using analytical synthesis technique. With a certain sample interval, the proposal of controller parameters is qualified to guarantee that end-effector states are constrained with preset boundary. The discretetime neural network estimation is designed to approximate the human being's behavior to rebuild the reference trajectory from the desired trajectory and impedance for smoothing the human-robot interaction. Controlled discrete-time states and estimated force are uniformly ultimately bounded, and the convergence vicinity around the origin is proven to be determined by sample interval, lumped uncertainty and preset boundary of state constraints. Numerical simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of proposed discrete-time barrier Lyapunov function based methods. (c) 2022 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using the adaptive control theory, the Lyapunov stability theory combined with the method of intermittent control, the simple but robust adaptive semiperiodically intermittent controller and impulse controller are designed. Via the proposed control methods, the response system can lag synchronize with the drive system, and the less conservative results are obtained. Using the adaptive control approach and giving a rigorous proof for the synchronization scheme, the proposed controllers are obviously little costly and more useful in practice than before. In the original references, the control width should be larger than the time delay and the time delay should be smaller than the noncontrol width. While, in this paper, these strict assumptions can be removed. Moreover, the control time and the control rate may not be constants. This leads to a larger application scope for our method. Last, numerical simulations are exploited to show the effectiveness of the results.

The remote information exchange between the sensor and controller in CPSs employs a multichannel network because of its inherent advantages of resistance to destruction as well as to attacks. In order to design defense strategies to mitigate the negative impact of network attacks on the tracking performance of CPSs, considering the goals and energy constraints of both sides, the interaction process between them is modeled as a zero-sum stochastic game. Then, the Nash equilibrium of the problem is found with the help of the proposed Q-learning algorithm through an artfully designed state-based adaptive one-stage reward function. On the basis of the obtained optimal mixed strategy, the resilient output tracking controller is designed. Different from the work focusing on remote state estimation by means of game theory, this study makes the first effort to design a resilient output tracking control algorithm for CPSs with multiple channels using a stochastic game approach. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed resilient controller with the optimal defense strategy is validated on a renewable energy generation system prototype by extensive case studies.

A set of quantitative and qualitative input variables are considered to characterize the new and existing pavement layers and predict the damage accumulation in these layers. To evaluate the impact of the inputs on the predicted performance for the rehabilitation options, sequential analyses were performed to assess the main and interactive effects of each input. Continuous responses surface models for interactive effects were obtained using artificial neural network. Furthermore, a normalized sensitivity index was used to quantify the significance of main and interactive effects. The following rehabilitation options were included in this paper: hot mix asphalt (HMA) over HMA, HMA over jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP), HMA over fractured JPCP, and JPCP over JPCP. The results of the study can assist the highway agencies' efforts to implementing the Pavement-ME, especially when the majority of pavement designs are related to rehabilitation of the existing highways.																			0315-1468	1208-6029				MAY	2018	45	5					386	392		10.1139/cjce-2017-0046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjce-2017-0046													WOS:000431318000006

Hybrid impulses allow synchronizing as well as desynchronizing impulses in one impulsive sequence, so their infinite time occurrence with the system may destroy the synchronization process. Therefore, the effective hybrid impulsive controller has been designed to deal with the difficulties in achieving the quasi-synchronization under the effects of hybrid impulses, which occur all the time, but their density of occurrence gradually decrease. In addition, the new concepts of average impulsive interval and average impulsive gain have been applied to cope with the simultaneous existence of synchronizing and desynchronizing impulses. Based on the Lyapunov method together with the extended comparison principle and the formula of variation of parameters for mixed time-varying delayed impulsive system, the delay-dependent sufficient criteria of quasi-synchronization have been derived for two separate cases, viz., T-alpha < infinity and T-alpha = infinity. Finally, the efficiency of the theoretical results has been illustrated by providing two numerical examples. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To make the tuning step easier and more understandable, this work focuses on probably one of the most important leverage to improve Neural Networks efficiency: the optimizer. These recent years, a great number of algorithms have been developed but they need an accurate tuning to be efficient. To get rid of this long and experimental step, we are looking for generic and desirable properties for non-convex optimization. For this purpose, the optimizers are reinterpreted or analyzed as a discretization of a continuous dynamical system. This continuous framework offers many mathematical tools in order to interpret the sensitivity of the optimizer with respect to the initial guess such as Lyapunov stability. By enforcing the discrete decrease of Lyapunov functionals, new robust and efficient optimizers are designed. They also considerably simplify the tuning of hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum etc.). These Lyapunov based algorithms outperform several state of the art optimizers on different benchmarks of the literature. Drawing its inspiration from the numerical analysis of PDEs, this paper emphasizes the essential role of some hidden energy/entropy quantities for machine learning tasks.

In this paper 1, we propose a novel system-level aging model to model the effects of asymmetric aging in NoCs. We observe a critical need of a holistic aging analysis, which when combined with power-performance optimization, poses a multi-objective design challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)based aging-aware routing algorithm that optimizes the various design constraints using a multi-objective formulation. After an extensive experimental analysis using real workloads, we observe a 62.7%, 46% average overhead reduction in network latency and Energy-Delay-Product-Per-Flit (EDPPF) and a 41% improvement in Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) using our aging-aware routing algorithm.

A main design objective of these networks is to eliminate or minimize the unavailability of network at some point. However, in infrastructure and the client part of WMN movement of nodes still creates delay as path failure detection and re-establishment consumes considerable time. Existing solutions for link classification operate on discrete values resulting in performance degradation. This problem can best be modelled through fuzzy logic based classification that is based on continuous values. This paper presents a new fuzzy logic based link status classification mechanism for use with multipath routing protocols in multi-hop wireless networks like WMNs. The proposed mechanism classifies the link status as active, about-to-break or broken. On the basis of link status, said algorithm predicts in advance that a particular link, on the active path between sender and receiver, is about to break and helps the reactive multipath routing protocol to start the rerouting operation, thus minimizing the route discovery frequency, delay and packet loss.

In order to obtain Pareto solutions, a non-cooperative differential game (NCDG) for nonlinear stochastic systems is also studied. It is worth mentioning that the mixed H2/H infinity control can achieve the expected H2 performance under the condition of the H infinity continuous attenuation. Firstly, the two-player nonzero-sum differential game for stochastic systems is given to obtain Nash equilibrium. Then, on this basis, a joint cost function is established, which is derived from Pareto strategies and the corresponding Hamiltonian function. Furthermore, two critic neural networks (NNs) are used to realize Nash equilibrium and Pareto equilibrium, respectively.

The mixed time-delays consist of randomly occurring time-delay and distributed sensor delays, where a random variable obeying the Bernoulli distribution is employed to characterize the phenomenon of randomly occurring time-delay. In addition, the phenomena of the multiple missing measurements are characterized by introducing a set of mutually independent random variables, which reflect that each sensor could have individual missing probability. Meanwhile, the additive variation of the estimator gain is considered to reflect the possible parameter deviations when implementing the state estimation algorithm. Our main purpose is to design a resilient state estimator such that, in the presence of multiple missing measurements, randomly occurring time-delay and distributed sensor delays, the estimation error dynamics is exponentially stable in the mean square. A sufficient condition is established to guarantee the existence of the resilient state estimator and the explicit expression of the desired estimator gain is given based on the solutions to some matrix inequalities. Finally, we use a numerical example to verify the validity of the presented resilient state estimation method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, F; Guo, ST; Shi, YW; Liao, XF				Wang, Fei; Guo, Songtao; Shi, Yawei; Liao, Xiaofeng			Distributed joint subcarrier and discrete power allocation for cognitive radio ad hoc networks	TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS												One of the key problems in orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA) cognitive radio (CR) ad hoc networks is to efficiently and fairly allocate subcarriers and powers in a distributed manner. However, two formidable shortcomings exist in most previous works. One is that the fairness issue has not been sufficiently taken into account so that different types of fairness among secondary users (SUs) may not be guaranteed. The other is that the transmission power of each SU is assumed to take any value in a continuous domain, whereas for practical CR ad hoc networks, the power level can only be quantized into discrete values. To overcome the above shortcomings, an optimization framework is first presented, where different types of fairness for resource allocation are considered and the transmission power of each SU is allowed to take only a finite number of discrete values. In particular, the fairness of resource allocation is guaranteed by associating each SU with a utility function for each subcarrier, where the utility function is allowed to be non-concave or non-differentiable so that our framework can deal with resource allocation for real-time applications. Furthermore, to solve the proposed non-convex integer optimization problem, a distributed algorithm with low complexity is proposed, according to which only limited cooperation among network entities is required. At last, simulation results verify that our algorithm has very good convergence and fairness performance, and then it may be applied to practical OFDMA-based CR ad hoc networks.

The measurement output is considered to be quantized by the dynamic quantizer before transmission through an unreliable communication channel, where the deception attacks may occur randomly. To further reduce the communication burden, the Round-Robin (RR) protocol is adopted to schedule sensors in a predetermined transmission order. Meanwhile, a new performance index is developed to solve restriction of the same dimension of control output and the exogenous disturbance. The S-procedure combined with a two-step uncertainties elimination method is adopted to deal with the nonlinear product terms involving multiple uncertainties. Furthermore, a decoupling method is introduced for static output feedback controller design. Sufficient conditions of the resilient controller and the dynamic quantizer are provided, which can improve the robustness of resulting closed-loop system and guarantee its stochastic stability and the specified mixed H infinity and passivity performance index. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the feasibility of the theoretical results.																			0142-3312	1477-0369				JAN	2024	46	1					27	38		10.1177/01423312231168915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01423312231168915		MAY 2023											WOS:000985734300001

A global optimal trajectory design scheme is proposed including a continuous analytic solution as well as optimization condition, which is theoretically different from numerical schemes obtaining a discrete piece-wise solution with approximate optimality. However, it is challenging to maximize the performance over entire infinite time slots in moving-user scenarios. By projecting the trajectory onto a user-relative coordinate frame, we reduce the performance to a location-determined function, which is in physical equivalence to an artificial potential field (APF). Accordingly, the optimization problem is reformulated to the shape determination problem of a density-varying catenary in the APF. By performing force analysis, we describe the topology of the catenary via a second-order differential equation determined by a boundary, i.e., any three combination of the location, orientation and turning curvature at arbitrary waypoints. Equivalently, the representation of the continuous solution is minimized in ultra-low-dimension parameter space and offers a flexible and lightning-speed design practice. Through complexity analysis, we find that the complexity of the proposed analytic scheme is significantly lower than the traditional discrete schemes. Further, we also prove that the global optimality, existence and uniqueness of the solution holds under a condition of a strong applicability to general sensing and communications (S & C) services. In simulation, the equivalence is confirmed and the results show global optimality, low-complexity and the high flexibility under avoidance, crossing and G-force limit.

J	Liu, ZC; Raju, L; Zhu, DY; Cai, WS				Liu, Zhaocheng; Raju, Lakshmi; Zhu, Dayu; Cai, Wenshan			A Hybrid Strategy for the Discovery and Design of Photonic Structures	IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS												Metasurfaces and metamaterials are playing a growing role in the control of electromagnetic waves in the application of communication, display, and sensing technologies. However, designing photonic structures as the building blocks of these systems is typically a tedious trial-and-error process that requires extensive simulations with iterative sweeps in a multi-dimensional parameter space. To circumvent this conventional approach and substantially expedite the discovery and development of photonic structures, here we develop a framework leveraging both a deep generative model and a modified evolution strategy to automate the inverse design of engineered photonic materials and devices. The capacity of the proposed methodology is tested through the application to a case study, where metasurfaces in either continuous or discrete topologies are generated in response to customer-defined spectra at the input. Through a variational autoencoder, all potential patterns of unit structures are encoded into a continuous latent space. An evolution strategy is applied to vectors in the latent space to identify an optimized vector whose corresponding metasurface fulfills the design objective. The evaluation shows that over 95% accuracy can be achieved for all the unit patterns of the metasurfaces in the test dataset. Our scheme requires no prior knowledge of the geometry of the photonic structures, and, in principle, allows joint optimization of the dimensional parameters. As such, our work represents an efficient, on-demand, and automated approach for the inverse design of photonic structures with subwavelength features.

J	Zhang, HL; Cui, GM				Zhang, Hongliang; Cui, Guomin			Optimal heat exchanger network synthesis based on improved cuckoo search via Levy flights	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN												Heat exchanger network synthesis (HENS) is still a challenging task for minimizing the Total Annual Cost (TAC). In this work, a Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) is introduced to solve the NonLinear Programming (NLP) problem of the fixed heat exchanger network design to determine the optimal heat load distribution, which can help improve the heat load configurations of previously found optimum configurations. The improved CSA (ICSA) is used to solve the Mixed Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) problem for optimal HENS, which can simultaneously optimize continuous and integer variables, and the proposed stream arrangement strategy aims to optimize the stream match search space by lowering the stage demands, i.e. reducing the number of independent variables, which is a promising means for an easier solution of large and medium sized HENS problems. Four large and medium sized benchmark cases have been investigated, obtaining no-splits results with lower TAC in a shorter computational time. In addition, a special feature from case 3 and 4 is analyzed, which is useful in order to achieve a lower TAC by using modified Stage-Wise Superstructure (SWS) models with flexible utility placement.

Guided by the theory of sustainable development, this thesis draws on the theoretical research results of ecotourism, external effects, tourism management, national parks, etc., studies the forest park management system, tourism development model, and development and construction ideas, and then summarizes forest tourism resources. Aiming at the shortcomings of the cost-route optimization of the axle-spoke tourism network design problem, this article introduces the segmented cost function to propose the problem of the axle-spoke tourism network design. At the same time, a mixed integer programming model for the problem is established, a greedy algorithm for solving the problem is designed, and an example provided by the AP data package is used as a platform to perform a calculation experiment on the model. Taking the AP2-6 network as a reference object, the superiority of the piecewise cost function over the two-stage cost function is analyzed.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2021	30	4					3211	3220																WOS:000658171700012
J	Wang, LC; Luo, Q				Wang, Licheng; Luo, Qi			Joint estimation of state, parameter, and unknown input for nonlinear systems: A composite estimation scheme	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												This study is concerned with the joint estimation problem for a class of nonlinear systems with the simultaneous unknown of the system state, the parameter, as well as the input signal. A composite estimation scheme is proposed where the estimator consists of both linear and nonlinear components, under which the estimation performance is improved. The analysis and synthesis issues of the developed estimation algorithm are addressed for both the continuous-time case and the discrete-time case. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory combined with the singular value decomposition technique, sufficient conditions are established for both continuous-time and discrete-time cases to guarantee the convergence of the estimation error, rather than the boundedness in most of the existing literature. To facilitate the algorithm implementation in practical engineering, the Newton-Raphson method is adopted to deal with the feasibility issue for the discrete-time case. Numerical simulations are provided for both the continuous- and discrete-time cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint estimation strategies.																			1049-8923	1099-1239				DEC	2021	31	18			SI		9519	9537		10.1002/rnc.5787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rnc.5787		SEP 2021											WOS:000696213000001

It is designed to find out the best (from the point of view of separation of different classes) divisions of continuous features or the best combinations of symbolic values of discrete features. It has been tested on several datasets to construct classification decision trees and decision rules. It can also be useful in continuous features discretization and estimation of feature's importance, which forms a first step of neural algorithms for extraction of logical rules from data.																					0-88986-452-7				2004							199	202																WOS:000228486200035

Firstly, a hybrid event-triggered method is proposed. Under this method, the hybrid consensus can be achieved asymptotically. Besides, the Zeno-behavior of the hybrid multi-agent system will not make an appearance due to the special design of the hybrid event-triggered conditions. Then, a self-triggered algorithm is further proposed to avoid the continuous monitoring of event-triggered conditions. Finally, several simulation examples are presented which are comparative and show the effectiveness of the two method. Moreover, the impact of the parameters in the main results is analyzed.

The maximum of the use of low-cost power (e.g. overnight pumping) and the maintenance of a target chlorine concentration at final delivery points were defined as important optimisation objectives. The first objective is constrained by the maintenance of minimum emergency volumes in all reservoirs, while the second objective would include the minimisation of chlorine dosage and re-dosage requirements. The combination of dynamic elements (e.g. reservoirs) and discrete elements (pumps, valves, routing) makes this a challenging predictive control and constrained optimisation problem, which is being solved by MINLP (Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming). Initial experimental results show the performance of this algorithm and its ability to control the water distribution process.

In MANET, a lot of network troubles occur due to the mobility of nodes and the limitation of energy. Therefore, when performing ubiquitous services with the application of MANET a technique is required to improve the packet transmission rate so as to enable continuous packet transmission while flexibly adapting to topology changes caused by the mobility of nodes. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a mixed protocol that applies both PAOMDV (Possibility based AOMDV) and OLSR-ME (OLSR with Modify Energy Efficiency). In this protocol, PAOMDV takes charge of the outside of cluster and OLSR-ME the inside of cluster so that the two protocols can complement each other. By experiment, this study compares the proposed protocol with the conventional protocols of AODV, AOMDV and ZRP, and verifies its performance.																					978-0-7695-2777-2				2007							843	+																WOS:000247093600139

We propose a modelling approach based on Petri nets. For this purpose, places of Petri nets stand for the road sections and transitions describe the flow between two consecutive sections at intersections. Thanks an adaptive spatial discretization the proposed models are suitable to represent the traffic flow either from a macroscopic point of view where only global variables are observed or from a microscopic one where the individual trajectories of vehicles are discussed. The proposed models suggest a mathematical framework for the analysis and control design in urban and interurban networks. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kus, Z; Kiraz, B				Kus, Zeki; Kiraz, Berna			Evolutionary Architecture Optimization for Retinal Vessel Segmentation	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS												Retinal vessel segmentation (RVS) is crucial in medical image analysis as it helps identify and monitor retinal diseases. Deep learning approaches have shown promising results for RVS, but designing optimal neural network architecture is challenging and time-consuming. Neural architecture search (NAS) is a recent technique that automates the design of neural network architectures within a predefined search space. This study proposes a new NAS method for U-shaped networks, MedUNAS, that discovers deep neural networks with high segmentation performance and lower inference time for RVS problem. We perform opposition-based differential evolution (ODE) and genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the best network structure and compare discrete and continuous encoding strategies on the proposed search space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first NAS study that performs ODE for RVS problems. The results show that the MedUNAS ODE and GA yield the best and second-best results regarding segmentation performance with less than 50% of the parameters of U-shaped state-of-the-art methods on most of the compared datasets. In addition, the proposed methods outperform the baseline U-Net on four datasets with networks with up to 15 times fewer parameters. Furthermore, ablation studies are performed to evaluate the generalizability of the generated networks to medical image segmentation problems that differ from the trained domain, revealing that such networks can be effectively adapted to new tasks with fine-tuning. The MedUNAS can be a valuable tool for automated and efficient RVS in clinical practice.

GHNs implementing the three most important nonlinear programming algorithms: Augmented Lagrangian, Generalized reduced Gradient and Successive Quadratic Programming methods were demonstrated. In the present work, the GHN construction is extended to discrete decision problems, specifically, mixed integer nonlinear problems such as arise in process design and scheduling applications. The proposed formulation does allow a natural parallelization of the optimization calculations, distributing the computational burden among a number of digital processors linear in the problem size. Furthermore, network solution appears to be amenable to the use of simple numerical integration methods with the integration in each processor carried out asynchronously. The use of a disjunctive constraint is shown to be superior to the sigmoid filter construction. The penalty parameter of the Augmented Lagrangian implementation appears to serve as a relaxation parameter which controls the extent of the domain within which alternative local optima are sought. Two examples are given to show the potential of the method for finding global optima to MINLPs.

Dynamic neural network (DNN) approximation can simplify the development of all the aforementioned problems in either continuous or discrete systems. A DNN is represented by a system of differential or recurrent equations defined in the space of vector activation functions with weights and offsets that are functionally associated with the input data. Design/methodology/approach This study describes the version of the toolbox, that can be used to identify the dynamics of the black box and restore the laws underlying the system using known inputs and outputs. Depending on the completeness of the information, the toolbox allows users to change the DNN structure to suit specific tasks. Findings The toolbox consists of three main components: user layer, network manager, and network instance. The user layer provides high-level control and monitoring of system performance. The network manager serves as an intermediary between the user layer and the network instance, and allows the user layer to start and stop learning, providing an interface to indirectly access the internal data of the DNN. Research limitations/implications Control capability is limited to adjusting a small number of numerical parameters and selecting functional parameters from a predefined list. Originality/value The key feature of the toolbox is the possibility of developing an algorithmic semi-automatic selection of activation function parameters based on optimization problem solutions.

Different from usually mode-dependent or mode-independent controller design methods, a partially mode-dependent dissipative controller is firstly proposed via using a mode-dependent Lyapunov function. The stochastic property of the mode available to a controller operation is taken into consideration in the corresponding controller design. Moreover, the existence of the established controller is given in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities.

This paper mainly focuses on a new theoretical principle of fuzzy logic, fuzzy reasoning, and its applications. It starts with enunciating a novel foundation: the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning. We then propose a practical framework, which enables the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning to be applied to various applications. This framework is divided into discrete case and continuous case. In the discrete case, we first solve the sorites paradox. We then proceed to a pattern recognition problem. So far, these are all passive approach in that the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning is used as is to measure if the reasoning is valid. In the continuous case, we proceed to actively designing the reasoning so that the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning is always guaranteed through Lyapunov stability approaches. This is formulated as a control-theoretic task. The problem of reasoning is converted to a control design one. This is then applied to a vehicle following problem. Through theoretical analysis and practical demonstrations, we show how the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning can be conceptualized, articulated, and formalized in fuzzy reasoning.

Whereas, most of previous general solutions failed to reach this goal due to the facts that (i) high computational complexity and heterogeneous operation steps in the tracking models and (ii) parallelism-limited and bloated hardware platforms (e.g., CPU/GPU). Although previously proposed devices leverage neural dynamics and near-data processing for efficient tracking, their flexibility is limited due to the tight integration with vision sensor and the effectiveness on various video datasets is yet to be fully demonstrated. On the other side, recently the many-core architecture with massive parallelism and optimized memory locality is being widely applied to improve the performance for flexibly executing neural networks. This motivates us to adapt and map an object tracking model based on attractor neural networks with continuous and smooth attractor dynamics onto neural network chips for fast tracking. In order to make the model hardware friendly, we add local-connection restriction. We analyze the tracking accuracy and observe that the model achieves comparable results on typical video datasets. Then, we design a many-core neural network architecture with several computation and transformation operations to support the model. Moreover, by discretizing the continuous dynamics to the corresponding discrete counterpart, designing a slicing scheme for efficient topology mapping, and introducing a constant-restricted scaling chain rule for data quantization, we build a complete mapping framework to implement the tracking model on the many-core architecture. We fabricate a many-core neural network chip to evaluate the real execution performance. Results show that a single chip is able to accommodate the whole tracking model, and a fast tracking speed of nearly 800 FPS (frames per second) can be achieved. This work enables high-speed object tracking on embedded devices which normally have limited resources and energy.

A shared emphasis of these networks is the use of data to support the improvement process, but little is known about their data use in practice. This study takes an in-depth look at the 800+ data artifacts created and used in a single focal network's 3rd year, applying a mixed methods case study design. The findings show that while data artifacts are predominantly created to support the improvement process, they are frequently used for relationship management as network hub members navigate the sociopolitical dynamics typical of a complex change effort - if they are used at all. The study has implications for practitioners as they decide what data artifacts to create and use, as well as for researchers' theory building about productive data use in improvement efforts.

Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in Cellular Networks With Shared Full-Duplex Relaying	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY												Recent advances in self-interference cancelation techniques enable full-duplex relaying (FDR) systems, which transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band with high spectrum efficiency. Unlike most existing works, we study the problem of energy-efficient resource allocation in FDR networks. We consider a shared FDR deployment scenario, where an FDR relay is deployed at the intersection of several adjacent cell sectors. First, a simple but practical transmission strategy is proposed to deal with the involved interference, i.e., multiaccess interference, multiuser interference, and self-interference. Then, the problem of joint power and subcarrier allocation is formulated to maximize the network-level energy efficiency while taking the residual self-interference into account. Since the formulated problem is a mixed combinatorial and nonconvex optimization problem with high computation complexity, we use Dinkelbach and discrete stochastic optimization methods to solve the energy-efficient resource-allocation problem efficiently. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.					Leung, Victor C. M./AGU-2462-2022; Yu, F. Richard/B-3182-2018	Leung, Victor C. M./0000-0003-3529-2640; Yu, F.

The goal is to satisfy a reachability specification and, at the same time, minimize the number of inputs that need to be set (influential inputs). To this purpose, we introduce an appropriate input parametrization so that, depending on the parameter values, some of the inputs act as control variables, while the others are treated as disturbances and can take an arbitrary value in their range. We then enforce the specification while maximizing the number of disturbance inputs. Two approaches are developed: one based on an open-loop scheme and one based on a compensation scheme. In the former, we end up solving a linear program. In the latter, the parametrization is extended so as to allow the influential inputs to depend on the non-influential ones, and the problem is reduced to a mixed integer linear program. A comparison between the two approaches is carried out, showing the superiority of the latter. Possible applications to system design and security of networked control systems are briefly discussed in the introduction.

In this paper, we propose a UAV-aided low latency mobile edge computing network with millimeter wave (mmWave) backhaul. There are two types of communication links in our network, the UAV link and the ad hoc link. We jointly consider the network resource allocation and the UAV trajectory design in our proposed problem, which is a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). For solving the proposed problem, we give a novel algorithm framework. We adopt generalized Benders decomposition (GAD) as the outer loop algorithm to separate the integer variables and continuous variables. In the inner loop, the continuous primal problem is solved by the joint alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), Dinkelbach algorithm and successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed system architecture and algorithm framework can achieve low latency for the time-sensitive task in mobile edge computing.

Specifically, first, by taking fully the relationship between the terms in the Leibniz-Newton formula into account, several improved delay-dependent exponential stability criteria are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Despite this success, they are often considered difficult to design because of the wide variety of parameters they require. Determining the most optimal selection of parameters has become tedious and costly, and neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been employed to try and take the guesswork out of the process. A common NAS approach is the genetic algorithm (GA); however, its usage is often exclusively tied to either the learnable parameters, or the meta-parameters that augment the learning. This work proposes an experimental approach for optimizing both real-valued weights and discrete meta-parameters simultaneously. Experimental results have shown that the current approach evolves both parameter sets effectively for simple problems like Iris, but still struggles in finding an optimal model for more rigorous problems.

Based on a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, stochastic analysis theory, and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, we derived some novel sufficient conditions that guarantee that the master systems exponentially synchronize with the slave systems. The design method of the desired sampled-data controller is also proposed. To reflect the most dynamical behaviors of the system, both Markovian jump parameters and stochastic disturbance are considered, where stochastic disturbances are given in the form of a Brownian motion. The results obtained in this paper are a little conservative comparing the previous results in the literature.

J	Ellegood, WA; Campbell, JF; North, J				Ellegood, William A.; Campbell, James F.; North, Jeremy			Continuous approximation models for mixed load school bus routing	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												School bus routing is a complex and expensive transportation problem for many public school districts. Typical school bus routes serve a single school, but mixed load school bus routes carry students for more than one school at the same time. A mixed load policy reduces the number of stops and distance to pick up and drop off children, but it can increase travel distance by visiting multiple schools. This paper provides a general strategic analysis using continuous approximation models to assess the conditions under which mixed loading is likely to be beneficial. We also present a case study for a semi-rural Missouri school district to illustrate the application of the models in practice. Results show that mixed load routing is more beneficial for larger districts, when a large percentage of bus stops are shared by students of different schools, and when schools are closer together.

Robust Quasi-Decentralized Control of Uncertain Process Networks	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												This paper presents a quasi-decentralized networked control methodology for the robust stabilization of process networks whose constituent subsystems communicate over a shared resource-constrained communication medium and are subject to time-varying external disturbances. The objective is to stabilize the plant and attenuate the influence of the disturbances while keeping the communication to a minimum in order to reduce the unnecessary utilization of network resources. Both state- and output-feedback control problems are considered. Initially, a local robust feedback controller is synthesized for each unit to account for the effect of the disturbances. Then, the exchange of information between the distributed control systems is reduced by embedding, within each control system, a set of dynamic models that provide forecasts of the evolution of the plant states when measurements are not transmitted through the shared network, and updating the state of each model when communication is re-established at discrete time instances. By analyzing the resulting combined discrete-continuous closed-loop system, a necessary and sufficient condition for robust stability of the networked closed-loop plant is obtained. The stability condition can be used to explicitly characterize the interplay between the update period, the degree of plant model mismatch, the selection of the controller design parameters, the size of the disturbances, and the size of the achievable degree of disturbance attenuation. Finally, the implementation of the robust networked control structure is demonstrated through an application to a chemical plant example.																			0888-5885					MAY 7	2014	53	18					7421	7433		10.1021/ie402365d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie402365d													WOS:000335878700014

Inspired by the robustness of sliding mode control, a new concept of impulsive-sliding mode is proposed to design robust impulsive controller for attitude stabilization. It illustrates that the designed impulsive controller possesses simple structure and robustness with respect to external disturbances. In order to achieve the relaxation of continuous measurement, we utilize periodic state measurement that is more economical and practical than the continuous one. Namely, we can achieve attitude stabilization and resource economization by adopting only discrete state measurement and discrete control input. More interestingly, our results can overcome the difficulty that the upper bound of disturbances is unknown, which is often required to design adaptive controller to handle in previous results. Moreover, we prove that the Zeno phenomenon can be excluded under the proposed periodic event-triggering strategy and the interevent time has a uniform lower bound. An illustrative example is presented to show the feasibility of our results.

OR SPECTRUM												Discrete-event simulation and (mixed-integer) linear programming are widely used for supply chain planning. We present a general framework to support the operational decisions for supply chain networks using a combination of an optimization model and discrete-event simulation. The simulation model includes nonlinear and stochastic elements, whereas the optimization model represents a simplified version. Based on initial simulation runs cost parameters, production, and transportation times are estimated for the optimization model. The solution of the optimization model is translated into decision rules for the discrete-event simulation. This procedure is applied iteratively until the difference between subsequent solutions is small enough. This method is applied successfully to several test examples and is shown to deliver competitive results much faster compared to conventional mixed-integer models in a stochastic environment. It provides the possibility to model and solve more realistic problems (incorporating dynamism and uncertainty) in an acceptable way. The limitations of this approach are given as well.

It is assumed that the agents have identical nominal dynamics while subject to different norm-bounded parameter uncertainties, leading to weakly heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Distributed controllers are designed for both continuous-and discrete-time multi-agent systems, based on the relative states of neighbouring agents and a subset of absolute states of the agents. It is shown for both the continuous-and discrete-time cases that the distributed robust control problems under such controllers in the sense of quadratic stability are equivalent to the H-infinity control problems of a set of decoupled linear systems having the same dimensions as a single agent. A two-step algorithm is presented to construct the distributed controller for the continuous-time case, which does not involve any conservatism and meanwhile decouples the feedback gain design from the communication topology. Furthermore, a sufficient existence condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities is derived for the distributed discrete-time controller. Finally, the distributed robust H-infinity control problems of uncertain linear multi-agent systems subject to external disturbances are discussed.

Now, it is particularly important to use various simulation softwares to expand the applications of the discrete memristor model. Based on the difference operator, in this paper, a discrete memristor model with quadratic nonlinearity is constructed. The addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of the discrete memristor mathematical model are clarified, and the charge q is obtained by combining the discrete-time summation module, thereby realizing the Simulink simulation of the discrete memristor. The simulation results show that the designed memristor meets the three fingerprints of memristor, indicating that the designed discrete memristor belongs to generalized memristor. Using memristors to construct chaotic systems is one of the current research hotspots, but most of the literature is about the introduction of continuous memristors into continuous chaotic systems. In this paper, the obtained discrete memristor is introduced into a three-dimensional chaotic map which is mentioned in a Sprott's book titled as Chaos and Time-Series Analysis, and a new four-dimensional memristor chaotic map is designed. Meanwhile, the Simulink model of the chaotic map is established. It is found that attractors with different sizes and shapes can be observed by changing the parameters in the Simulink model, indicating that the changes of system parameters and memristor parameters can change the dynamic behavior of the system. The analyses of equilibria and equilibrium stability show that the four-dimensional chaotic map has infinite equilibrium points. The Lyapunov exponent spectra and bifurcation diagrams of the circuit imply that the map can transform between weak chaotic state, chaotic state, and hyperchaotic state. Meanwhile, the multistability and coexisting attractors are analyzed under different initial conditions. Moreover, by comparing the results of measuring the complexity, it is found that the chaotic map with discrete memristor has richer dynamical behaviors and higher complexity than the original map. From the perspective of system modeling, in this paper the discrete memristor modeling and discrete memristor map designing are discussed based on the Matlab/Simulink. It further verifies the realizability and lays a foundation for the future applications of discrete memristor.																			1000-3290					FEB 5	2022	71	3							030501	10.7498/aps.71.20211549	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.71.20211549													WOS:000762955900005

Besides conducting basic lab experiments and deriving fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic models, a crucial task within the entire process design is the synthesis of an optimal reactor-network constituting the core of a chemical process. However, instead of directly up-scaling the process to large devices, it is wise to investigate process characteristics on the miniplant scale. For an existing miniplant for the hydroformylation of 1-do decene using a rhodium catalyst and a thermomorphic solvent system for catalyst recovery, two optimized reactor designs are derived. Suitable reactor-networks were synthesized by applying the Flux Profile Analysis approach introduced in Kaiser et al. (2017). The combination of a first reactor with dynamic/distributed control options and a subsequent back-mixed continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) arose to be the most promising configurations. The technical design under miniplant conditions was carried out for two possible realizations of this network, namely (i) a continuous flow reactor and (ii) a periodically operated semibatch reactor, both followed by the existing CSTR which was originally operated in the miniplant. An optimization of the two optimal reactor configurations within an overall process including a liquid liquid phase separation for catalyst recovery and a distillation column for separating the solvents and reactant evinced a selectivity with respect to the linear aldehyde around 94% and a conversion around 98%. This is a large improvement of the process performance of 24% linear aldehyde selectivity and 40% conversion when using the existing CSTR.

This system was solved globally using an interval method by Ratschek and Rokne (1993) in the box [0, 10](9). Their algorithm had enormous costs (i.e., over 14 months using a network of 30 Sun Spare-1 workstations) but they state that "at this time, we know no other method which has been applied to this circuit design problem and which has led to the same guaranteed result of locating exactly one solution in this huge domain, completed with a reliable error estimate". The present paper gives a novel branch-and-prune algorithm that obtains a unique safe box for the above system within reasonable computation times. The algorithm combines traditional interval techniques with an adaptation of discrete constraint-satisfaction techniques to continuous problems. Of particular interest is the simplicity of the approach.																			0925-5001	1573-2916				JUL	1998	13	1					75	93		10.1023/A:1008236911603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008236911603													WOS:000074807000005

Integral barrier Lyapunov functionals are constructed to handle the unknown affine control gains (g(.)) with state constraints simultaneously. This removes the need on the knowledge of control gains for control design and avoids the conservative step of transforming original state constraints into new bounds on tracking errors. Neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate the unknown continuous packaged functions. To enhance the robustness, adapting parameters are developed to compensate the unknown bounds on NNs approximations and external disturbances. Design parameters-dependent feasibility conditions are formulated as sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible design parameters to guarantee the state constraints, and an offline constrained optimization step is proposed to obtain the optimal design parameters prior to the implementation of the proposed control. It is proved that the proposed control can guarantee the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in closed-loop system, all states are ensured to remain in the predefined constrained state space, and tracking error converges to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin by choosing appropriate design parameters. Simulations are performed to validate the proposed control.

Instead of the continuous measurement, the sampled measurement is used to estimate the neuron states and a sampled-data estimator is constructed. To fully use the sawtooth structure characteristics of the sampling input delay, sufficient conditions are derived such that the system governing the error dynamics is asymptotically stable. The design method of the desired state estimator is proposed. We construct a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple and quadruple integral terms then by using a novel free-matrix-based integral inequality (FMII) including well-known integral inequalities as special cases. Moreover, the design procedure can be easily achieved by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily facilitated by using the standard numerical software. Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

The approach followed is based on a Generalized Pock (GF) space framework developed by the Principal Investigator and T.A.W. Dwyer, III. A GF space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of discrete or continuous Volterra series with a problem-dependent weighted inner product. The optimal nonlinear filter structure is obtained by an orthogonal projection of the desired filter into the subspace spanned by the representers of interpolating, smoothing, and other design constraint functionals in the appropriate GF space. One of the attractive features of this approach is that the solutions to the filter design problem appear naturally as feedforward (FIR) or recurrent (IIR) artificial neural networks. These results are derived for a GF space F(E-N) on a finite-dimensional Euclidian space E-N. Generalization to functional FIR and IIR nonlinear filters follows immediately from replacing F(E-N) by F(L-2(I)), where L-2(I) is the space of square integrable functions on an interval I of the real line.																					0-7803-3583-X				1997							709	712																WOS:A1997BJ47Z00178
J	Gelle, E; Faltings, B				Gelle, E; Faltings, B			Solving mixed and conditional constraint satisfaction problems	CONSTRAINTS												Constraints are a powerful general paradigm for representing knowledge in intelligent systems. The standard constraint satisfaction paradigm involves variables over a discrete value domain and constraints which restrict the solutions to allowed value combinations. This standard paradigm is inapplicable to problems which are either: (a) mixed, involving both numeric and discrete variables, or (b) conditional,(1) containing variables whose existence depends on the values chosen for other variables, or (c) both, conditional and mixed. We present a general formalism which handles both exceptions in an integral search framework. We solve conditional problems by analyzing dependencies between constraints that enable us to directly compute all possible configurations of the CSP rather than discovering them during search. For mixed problems, we present an enumeration scheme that integrates numeric variables with discrete ones in a single search process. Both techniques take advantage of enhanced propagation rule for numeric variables that results in tighter labelings than the algorithms commonly used. From real world examples in configuration and design, we identify several types of mixed constraints, i.e. constraints defined over numeric and discrete variables, and propose new propagation rules in order to take advantage of these constraints during problem solving.																			1383-7133					APR	2003	8	2					107	141		10.1023/A:1022394531132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022394531132													WOS:000220241700001

The considered systems contain both continuous-and discrete time positive subsystems. The notion of hybrid L1 x L1-gain performance is introduced for hybrid positive systems. First, some sufficient conditions for the stability of the system without disturbances are established using a hybrid copositive Lyapunov function incorporated with average dwell time switching. Then, the characterization on the stability with hybrid L1 x L1-gain performance of the system with continuous-and discrete-time disturbances is explored based on linear programming. A hybrid average dwell time switching law is proposed, where continuous-and discrete-time subsystems have their own average dwell time switching. Furthermore, a hybrid controller of the system is designed by virtue of matrix decomposition approach. Finally, one example is given to verify the validity of the results. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

In PWA systems, the state space is partitioned into several regions and in each region, system behavior is described by an affine equation. We will call each region a mode. It is well-known that PWA systems can be expressed by mixed logical dynamical(MLD) systems. We will propose a design method for PWA systems with specified symbolic dynamics, where specified periodic mode transitions exhibit. Constant terms in PWA systems are taken as design parameters, and by determining configuration of an equilibrium of the affine equation in each mode, we construct PWA systems satisfying the specifications. We will apply the proposed method to the design of a continuous-time switching network as an example.																					0-7803-8346-X				2004							605	608																WOS:000225098500152

This paper presents user equipment (UE)-assisted mobility management mechanism over SDN, the mobile terminals reported their location information voluntarily, and the handover signalling progress between Small Cells (SCell) was designed based on the location information. For ultra dense networks (UDNs), a continuous communication session can be achieved by using a double-labelling scheme and a dynamic local forwarding chain, where the data packets of a continuous session can be transmitted in a certain condition, without switching the whole traffic path, and by combining with the global control of the SDN controller, data forwarding (the way of data arriving is from the source SCell to the target SCell) instead of data transmission (means that data is transmitted to the target SCell directly) was conducted. To set a reasonable threshold for various need, the scheme can achieve the tradeoff between extra data delivery overhead and signalling overhead. A hexagonal discrete-time Markov chain model was adopted for performance analysis, theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can significantly reduce the signalling costs.

J	Bagloee, SA; Sarvi, M				Bagloee, Saeed Asadi; Sarvi, Majid			An outer approximation method for the road network design problem	PLOS ONE												Best investment in the road infrastructure or the network design is perceived as a fundamental and benchmark problem in transportation. Given a set of candidate road projects with associated costs, finding the best subset with respect to a limited budget is known as a bilevel Discrete Network Design Problem (DNDP) of NP-hard computationally complexity. We engage with the complexity with a hybrid exact-heuristic methodology based on a two-stage relaxation as follows: (i) the bilevel feature is relaxed to a single-level problem by taking the network performance function of the upper level into the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem (UE-TAP) in the lower level as a constraint. It results in a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem which is then solved using the Outer Approximation (OA) algorithm (ii) we further relax the multi-commodity UE-TAP to a single-commodity MILP problem, that is, the multiple OD pairs are aggregated to a single OD pair. This methodology has two main advantages: (i) the method is proven to be highly efficient to solve the DNDP for a large-sized network of Winnipeg, Canada. The results suggest that within a limited number of iterations (as termination criterion), global optimum solutions are quickly reached in most of the cases; otherwise, good solutions (close to global optimum solutions) are found in early iterations. Comparative analysis of the networks of Gao and Sioux-Falls shows that for such a non-exact method the global optimum solutions are found in fewer iterations than those found in some analytically exact algorithms in the literature. (ii) Integration of the objective function among the constraints provides a commensurate capability to tackle the multi-objective (or multi-criteria) DNDP as well.					sarvi, majid/A-2397-2009	Asadi Bagloee, Saeed/0000-0001-6078-6314													1932-6203					MAR 28	2018	13	3							e0192454	10.1371/journal.pone.0192454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192454								29590111					WOS:000428603100004

We present a method for designing decentralized event-triggered synchronization, which only utilizes locally available information, in order to determine the time instants for transmission from sensors to a central controller. By applying a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, as well as using the reciprocal convex combination method and some inequality techniques such as Jensen's inequality, we obtain several sufficient conditions in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) under which the delayed neural networks are stochastically stable in terms of the error systems. Finally, we conclude that the drive systems synchronize stochastically with the response systems.

Furthermore, the phase and amplitude of neurons in the 2bit ND 2 NN model are both considered as learnable parameters. We use a revised formula to determine the size of neurons in the model, and we determine the diffraction grating spacing, the number of grating layers, the pixel size and the pixel counts through ablation experiments.

Stable digital control networks for continuous passive plants subject to delays and data dropouts	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 46TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL, VOLS 1-14	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control				46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	DEC 12-14, 2007	New Orleans, LA	IEEE Control Syst Soc, United Technol, Springer, Wiley Blackwell, Taylor & Francis, Princeton Univ Press, Maplesoft, Siam				This paper provides a framework to synthesize l(2)- stable networks in which the controller and plant can be subject to delays and data dropouts. This framework can be applied to control systems which use "soft-real-time' cooperative schedulers as well as those which use wired and wireless network feedback. The approach applies to passive plants and controllers that can be either linear, nonlinear, and (or) time-varying. This framework is based on fundamental results presented here related to passive control and scattering theory which are used to design passive force-feedback telemanipulation systems. Theorem 3 states how a (non)linear (strictly input or strictly output) passive plant can be transformed to a discrete (strictly input) passive plant using a particular digital sampling and hold scheme. Furthermore, Theorem 4(5) provide new sufficient conditions for l(2) (and L-2)-stability in which a strictly-output passive controller and plant are interconnected with only wave-variables. Lemma 2 shows it is sufficient to use discrete wave-variables when data is subject to fixed time delays and dropouts in order to maintain passivity. Lemma 3 shows how to safely handle time varying discrete wave-variable data in order to maintain passivity. We then present a new cooperative scheduler algorithm to implement a l(2) -stable control network. We also provide an illustrative simulated example followed by a discussion of future research.																			0743-1546		978-1-4244-1497-0				2007							4554	4561																WOS:000255181702144

Learning a good representation of mixed data is critical yet challenging for further learning tasks. Existing methods for representing mixed data often overlook the heterogeneous coupling relationships between categorical and continuous features as well as the discrimination between objects. To address these issues, we propose an auto-instructive representation learning scheme to enable margin-enhanced distance metric learning for a discrimination-enhanced representation. Accordingly, we design a metric-based auto-instructor (MAI) model which consists of two collaborative instructors. Each instructor captures the feature-level couplings in mixed data with fully connected networks, and guides the infinite-margin metric learning for the peer instructor with a contrastive order. By feeding the learned representation into both partition-based and density-based clustering methods, our experiments on eight UCI datasets show highly significant learning performance improvement and much more distinguishable visualization outcomes over the baseline methods.						cao, longbing/0000-0003-1562-9429; Jian, Songlei/0000-0002-1435-0410													2159-5399	2374-3468	978-1-57735-800-8				2018							3318	3325																WOS:000485488903050

Mixing is needed to break the mycelium network and to avoid such failure. This study presents the first attempt to quantify and predict the effect of mycelium bonds on particle mixing and vice versa. We developed a novel experimental set-up to measure the tensile strength of hyphal bonds in SSF: Aspergillus oryzae was cultivated between two wheat-dough disks and the tensile strength of the aerial mycelium was measured with a texture analyzer. Tensile strength at different incubation times was related to oxygen consumption, to allow a translation to a rotating drum with A. oryzae cultivated on wheat grain. We performed several discontinuously mixed solid-state fermentations in the drum fermentor and measured the number and size of grain-aggregates remaining after the first mixing action. We integrated data on mycelium tensile strength into a previously developed two-dimensional discrete-particle model that calculates forces acting on individual substrate particles and the resulting radial-particle movements. The discrete-particle model predicted the quantity and size of the aggregates remaining after mixing successfully. The results show that the first mixing event in SSF with A. oryzae is needed to break mycelium to avoid aggregate formation in the grain bed, and not to distribute water added to compensate for evaporation losses, or smooth out temperature gradients.

A plane model P was used to describe the variation of seed layer thickness. Four square areas on the bottom of the tray were divided symmetrically near the four corners to measure seed layer thickness, and a monitoring plane model P-m was established. DEM simulation results showed that the models P-m and P had the similar change rules, although there were some differences in fitting parameters. There was obvious time delay in the change of P-m compared with P. Therefore, a grey system model (GM) was adopted to predict the change of P-m , and two back-propagation (BP) neural networks which take GM prediction results as input parameters were developed respectively. Then, according to the BP neural networks outputs, a prediction plane model P-p was proposed to predict the seed distribution. Experiments were carried out on a test-rig to validate these predictions. The seed distribution plane P was measured manually, the monitoring plane P-m was established using seed layer thickness measurement results and the prediction plane P-p was established using the GM and BP neural networks. The results indicated that the proposed method had good precision and stability and provides the basis for the design of an automatic control system for the vibrating tray to promote a uniform seed distribution.

In order to unify these existing theoretical results of ETC and develop ETC strategies for nonlinear systems, whose state variables evolve steadily at one time and change intermittently at another time, this article investigates quasisynchronization of delayed neural networks (NNs) on time scales with discontinuous activation functions via ETC approaches. First, the existence of the Filippov solutions is proved for discontinuous NNs with finite discontinuities. Second, two static event-triggered conditions and two dynamic event-triggered conditions are established to avoid continuous communication between the master-slave systems under algebraic/matrix inequality criteria. Third, under static/dynamic event-triggered conditions, a positive lower bound of event-triggered intervals is demonstrated to be greater than a positive number for each event-based controller, which shows that the Zeno behavior will not occur. Finally, two numerical simulations are carried out to show the effectiveness of the presented theoretical results in this article.

J	Liu, RH; Yu, Y; Huang, M				Liu, Ruihan; Yu, Yang; Huang, Min			A dynamic incentive mechanism for data sharing in manufacturing industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS												Data sharing is a critical component in a blockchain traceability platform. Therefore, creating a reasonable incentive mechanism to ensure that all enterprises participate in data sharing is vital for blockchain platforms. Currently, many researchers employ evolutionary game theory to analyze problems related to data sharing. However, evolutionary game theory typically assumes that the population composed of enterprises is mixed uniformly. Enterprises in the manufacturing industry are not uniformly mixed, as they tend to have specific connections with each other due to the size of enterprises and volume of business. Therefore, a networked evolutionary game is introduced to solve this problem. Firstly, an incentive model for enterprises sharing data is established. Then, a scale-free network is employed to simulate the connections between enterprises. To comprehensively consider the individual and group benefits of enterprises in the game, this study designs a strategy update rule for networked evolutionary game based on Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization and Variable Neighborhood Descent algorithm. To tackle the challenge of determining reasonable incentive values in networked evolutionary games, this study proposes a dynamic incentive mechanism based on the Q-Learning algorithm. Finally, the experiments indicate that this method can successfully facilitate the stable involvement of enterprises in data sharing.

J	Hao, S; Zhang, HY; Wang, J				Hao, Sheng; Zhang, Hu-yin; Wang, Jing			A Learning Automata Based Stable and Energy-Efficient Routing Algorithm for Discrete Energy Harvesting Mobile Wireless Sensor Network	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS												Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been widely used in urban network system and networked monitoring system, which provide easy connectivity and high physical data rate. Considering the battery-limited property of sensor nodes, recently, energy harvesting (EH) technology is introduced into WSN, which can alleviate traditional WSN problems (energy consumption, energy equilibrium, transmission efficiency, etc.). Current EH-WSN routing algorithms generally use the continuous energy harvesting mode, therefore, how to design an efficient routing algorithm for discrete energy harvesting mode and ensure the overall energy balance and conservation is still a great challenge and needs to be solved. Especially, under the mobile environment, the impact of route stability needs to be considered, which makes the design more complicated. To address the above problems, we propose a learning automata (LA) theory based stable and energy-efficient routing algorithm for discrete EH-mobile WSN (DEH-LA-SERA, for short). Firstly, we construct a multi-factors measurement model for sensor nodes, which contains node stability model, energy ratio function, expected harvesting energy model (using Markov decision process method) and direction judgement model. On this basis, we derive the node weighted value, i.e., selecting probability, which can be used to determine whether a node can be chosen as relay node. Secondly, with the help of LA theory, we construct a feedback mechanism to adjust the optimal path. With this solution, we can ensure the overall energy balance and conservation while holding the stability of selected path. As demonstrated in simulation experiments, our algorithm, DEH-LA-SERA, achieved the best performance in route survival time, energy consumption, energy balance and acceptable performance in end-to-end delay and packets delivery ratio.																			0929-6212	1572-834X				JUL	2019	107	1					437	469		10.1007/s11277-019-06284-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-019-06284-3													WOS:000471348600026

A combined network-discrete event-continuous simulation model of an RDH tank farm was developed using the SLAM II simulation language. The model simulates the dynamic behavior of the system variables (such as liquor levels in different tanks) based on supplied information about equipment in the tank farm and distributions of time to complete each processing step. The output of the simulation model includes statistics on production, total cooking cycle time, utilization of equipment, and statistics on waiting times. The simulation model was very successful in predicting the brownstock pulp production as well as demonstrating the bottlenecks of the system. The model will be useful in the design of an RDH system, since it can be used to optimize various tank sizes and to identify equipment bottlenecks. It may also be used to check different process control strategies.																			0734-1415					JUL	1994	77	7					213	220																WOS:A1994NW99600025
J	Lee, J; Haddad, WM				Lee, Junsoo; Haddad, Wassim M.			On finite-time stability and stabilization of nonlinear hybrid dynamical systems	AIMS MATHEMATICS												Finite time stability involving dynamical systems whose trajectories converge to a Lyapunov stable equilibrium state in finite time have been studied for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. For continuous-time systems, finite time stability is defined for equilibria of continuous but non-Lipschitzian nonlinear dynamics, whereas discrete-time systems can exhibit finite time stability even when the system dynamics are linear, and hence, Lipschitz continuous. Alternatively, for impulsive dynamical systems it may be possible to reset the system states to an equilibrium state achieving finite time stability without requiring a non-Lipschitz condition for the continuous-time part of the hybrid system dynamics. In this paper, we develop sufficient Lyapunov conditions for finite time stability of impulsive dynamical systems using both a scalar differential Lyapunov inequality on the continuous-time dynamics as well as a scalar difference Lyapunov inequality on the discrete-time resetting dynamics. Furthermore, using our proposed finite time stability results, we design universal hybrid finite time stabilizing control laws for impulsive dynamical systems. Finally, we present several numerical examples for finite time stabilization of network impulsive dynamical systems.

An asynchronous fuzzy fault-tolerant controller is designed to deal with the actuator failures, which results in the closed-loop system is stochastically stable with a prescribed mixed H-infinity/passive performance level even if the actuator failures appear. In order to relieve the transmission pressure over the network, the authors utilise different event-triggered schemes and compare their ability of network resource saving. In addition, there is a difference between the system modes and the controller modes to formulate the asynchronisation phenomena. By implementing the delay system method, in combination with the free-weighting matrix and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, some conditions on the performance analysis are established to ensure the stochastic stability of the system. Then, controller gain matrices and event-triggered matrices can be obtained simultaneously based on a group of feasible linear matrix inequalities. Finally, simulations are given to show the availability of the proposed method.

However, there is a need for efficient optimization trajectory techniques to allow for continuous service connectivity for FBSs operating at regions beyond single-hop backhauling to their depot (i.e., fixed macro base station). This work proposes an optimization trajectory planning framework to provide continuous service delivery of FBSs by utilizing aerial relay nodes which can also serve ground users (GUs). The proposed joint optimization framework of FBSs trajectories where a subset of them acts as relay nodes called relay-FBS (rFBS) provides tangible gains compared to previously proposed nominal techniques. More specifically, a wide set of numerical investigations reveals that the proposed framework reduces aggregate travel time (ATT) more than 14% for the entire fleet of FBSs, whilst for rFBS to enable continuous service support, this average gain is more than 38%.

We introduce a new Lyapunov functional, called complete sampling-interval-dependent discontinuous Lyapunov functional, which can adequately capture sampling information on both intervals from r(t - (tau) over bar) to r(t(k) - (tau) over bar) and from r(t - (tau) over bar) to r(t(k+1) - (tau) over bar). Based on this Lyapunov functional and an improved integral inequality, less conservative conditions are derived to ensure the stability of the synchronization error system, leading to the fact that the drive neural network is synchronized with the response neural network. The desired sampled-data controller is designed in terms of solutions to linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate that the proposed approaches are effective and superior to some existing ones in the literature. (c) 2018 The Franklin Institute.

Long-time research work at TTU has given reasons for preference of continuous models for analysis with use of relative deflection of the structure as the main unknown quantity in definitive system of equations. In spite of advantages of continuous analysis in some cases use of discrete calculation models is unavoidable, especially for suspension bridges and cable networks. Displacements of supporting structures under action of cable forces are taken into account immediately in definitive equations for both models. Determination of the stress-strain state of structures proceeds from non-linear conditions of equilibrium and equations of deformation compatibility of cables. In case of continuous analysis use of these equations brings us to a cubic equation (or system of equations) regarding the relative deflection (or deflection parameters). Displacements of cable supports are usually assumed as linear functions of cable forces. The main attention in our report is paid to prestressed cable trusses, girder-stiffened structures and cable-networks.																					90-5809-599-1				2003							951	956																WOS:000187006900144

In the context of distributed manufacturing, one job has different process routes in different workshops because of heterogeneous manufacturing resources and manufacturing environments in each factory. Considering the heterogeneous process planning problems and shop scheduling problems simultaneously can take advantage of the characteristics of distributed factories to finish the processing task well. Thus, a novel network-based mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is established for distributed integrated process planning and scheduling problem (DIPPS). The paper designs a new encoding method based on the process network and its OR-nodes, and then proposes a discrete artificial bee colony algorithm (DABC) to solve the DIPPS problem. The proposed DABC can guarantee the feasibility of individuals via specially-designed mapping and switching operations, so that the process precedence constraints contained by the network graph can be satisfied in the entire procedure of the DABC algorithm. Finally, the proposed MILP model is verified and the proposed DABC is tested through some open benchmarks. By comparing with other powerful reported algorithms and obtaining new better solutions, the experiment results prove the effectiveness of the proposed model and DABC algorithm successfully.

One way to achieve this is through optimization of flow rate injection based on the use of the setpoint curve concept. In order to obtain that, a methodology is proposed. It allows for the assessment of the flow rate and pressure head that each pumping station has to provide for the proper functioning of the network while the minimum power consumption is kept. The methodology can be addressed in two ways: the discrete method and the continuous method. In the first method, a finite set of combinations is evaluated between pumping stations. In the continuous method, the search for the optimal solution is performed using optimization algorithms. In this paper, Hooke-Jeeves and Nelder-Mead algorithms are used. Both the hydraulics and the objective function used by the optimization are solved through EPANET and its Toolkit.

Main concepts and mathematical formulation	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												A novel network-based framework for the short-term scheduling of multi-purpose batch processes is presented. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in five key concepts. First, it is based on a new continuous-time representation that does not require tasks to start (end) exactly at a time point; thus reducing the number of time points needed to represent a solution. Second, processing units are modeled as being in different activity states to allow storage of input/output materials. Third, time variables for "idle" and "storage" periods of a unit are introduced to enable the matching between tasks and time points without big-M constraints. Fourth, material transfer variables are introduced to explicitly account for unit connectivity. Fifth, inventory variables for storage in processing units are incorporated to model non-simultaneous and partial material transfers. The proposed representation leads to MILP formulations which address limitations of existing scheduling methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The design principles of discrete turing patterning systems	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												The formation of spatial structures lies at the heart of developmental processes. However, many of the underlying gene regulatory and biochemical processes remain poorly understood. Turing patterns constitute a main candidate to explain such processes, but they appear sensitive to fluctuations and variations in kinetic parameters, raising the question of how they may be adopted and realised in naturally evolved systems. The vast majority of mathematical studies of Turing patterns have used continuous models specified in terms of partial differential equations. Here, we complement this work by studying Turing patterns using discrete cellular automata models. We perform a large-scale study on all possible two-species networks and find the same Turing pattern producing networks as in the continuous framework. In contrast to continuous models, however, we find these Turing pattern topologies to be substantially more robust to changes in the parameters of the model. We also find that diffusion-driven instabilities are substantially weaker predictors for Turing patterns in our discrete modelling framework in comparison to the continuous case, in the sense that the presence of an instability does not guarantee a pattern emerging in simulations. We show that a more refined criterion constitutes a stronger predictor. The similarity of the results for the two modelling frameworks suggests a deeper underlying principle of Turing mechanisms in nature. Together with the larger robustness in the discrete case this suggests that Turing patterns may be more robust than previously thought. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Graph neural network on the dynamic graph learns dynamic features of nodes through time and structure exploration, and then performs downstream node-level (or edge-level or graph-level) task inference. Most research works model a sequence of graph snapshots for a set of discrete times (with the same interval), but such methods are difficult to handle for a dynamic graph that changes rapidly over time. In the case of a continuous-time dynamic graph, we design a Contrastive Hawkes Graph neural network with Dynamic Sampling (CHGDS) to model explicit historical importance and explore diverse neighbors. CHGDS establishes the time effect of nodes by Hawkes graph convolution, distinguishing the influence of different historical events on the current node. With dynamic sampling, our method balances time and space exploration of multi -hop neighbors. During the training phase, a contrastive learning strategy is adopted to enhance the robustness of dynamic node features. Experimental results on three continuous time dynamic graph datasets demonstrate up to 2% improvement of our model over the state -of -the -art methods.

A customised library of categorised network components allows for quick, easy and efficient model construction and testing of system or network performance. The simulation model possesses the ability to communicate with external applications such as sophisticated and specialised battery management activities, which allow short-term monitoring and control algorithms for simulating process level interaction, long-term monitoring and supervision at the gateway level and knowledge and data management at the remote management level. These features of the simulation model allow for encapsulation of the primary battery system aspects of battery operation management, network communication management and network data management. A case study of a typical 4-string battery network model is presented to illustrate the use of model building blocks in constructing, designing and configuring battery network simulation models and in determining network performance.

The objective is to minimize the upper bound of an infinite horizon cost function subject to a terminal inequality by using induced L-2-norm bound. This work is an extension of the MPC approach proposed in Kothare et al. (1996) to switched systems under arbitrary switching law and with additive disturbances. The switched structure of the system is taken into account and by using some mathematical tools, the predictive controller design problem is turned into a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) feasibility problem. Finally, the main results of this method are applied to a drinking water supply network (DWSN). More precisely, a MPC strategy to regulate the water storage in each tank, in the presence of physical structural modifications, is proposed. Simulation results are proposed to show the good convergence properties of the control. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A round-robin protocol (RRP)-based event-triggering communication mechanism is proposed to significantly mitigate the burden of communication between the sensor network and the controller. Then, new static output-feedback VSC laws are designed, with an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network integrated to approximate uncertain system perturbations. Unlike existing results that the RRP is applied to discrete-time systems due to its relatively simple analysis, this work develops some techniques to analyze the RRP-based Markov jump system in continuous time. Sufficient conditions of the semiglobal practical finite-time stochastic stability are provided for the resulting variable-structure system.

The estimators comprise output sparse error approximators and unknown input observers (UIOs). The advantage of using digital estimators is that in many cases the condition for the existence of an UIO fails for continuous-time (CT) plants while it holds for discretized plants. A class of CT systems for which the existence condition for the UIO holds in the discrete-time (DT) domain is characterized. The proposed digital estimators are tested on a nonlinear networked control system (NCS). As part of our analysis, we study the existence of unknown input observers for discretized systems and show that discretization does not negatively impact the existence of UIOs and in some cases can facilitate the construction of UIOs when they do not exist for the CT systems.

Based on the average dwell time approach, a new method is proposed where both stability and fault detection are considered, simultaneously, through certain performance indexes.

The techniques have a wide range of applications in various downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and network alignment. Despite recent efforts to the design of novel models, little attention has been paid to understanding the instability of network embedding. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating several state-of-the-art network embedding methods. Node embeddings form a geometric shape in the latent space. Characterizing the geometry is critical to figure out the variance of network embedding. Hence, we define two metrics to characterize the geometric properties and find that node embeddings tremble in different instantiations of an embedding space. Then, we formally define the stability of node embeddings as the invariance of the nearest neighbors of nodes. Experimental results show that existing embedding approaches have significant amounts of instability. We explore the influence factors that affect the stability of different methods and find that both network structure and algorithm models affect the stability of node embeddings significantly. Finally, we examine the implications of embedding instability for downstream tasks and find remarkable impacts on the performance.

J	Li, GC; Yan, Z				Li, Guocheng; Yan, Zheng			Reconstruction of sparse signals via neurodynamic optimization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS												It is significant to solve l1 minimization problems efficiently and reliably in compressed sensing (CS) since the l1 minimization is essential for the recovery of sparse signals. In view of this, a neurodynamic optimization approach is proposed for solving the l1-minimization problems for reconstruction of sparse signals based on a projection neural network (PNN). The proposed neurodynamic optimization approach differs from most l1-solvers in that it operates in continuous time rather than being specified by discrete iterations; i.e., it evolves according to deterministic neurodynamics. The proposed PNN is designed based on subgradient projection methods. The neural network has a simple structure, giving it a potential to be implemented as a large-scale analog circuit. It is proved that under appropriate conditions on the measurement matrix, every neuronal state of the proposed neural network is convergent to the optimal solution of the l1-minimization problem under study. Simulation results are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

We use a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model incorporating both the nonlinear physical laws and the discrete decisions such as switching pumps on and off. We demonstrate that for instances from our industry partner, these stationary models can be solved to epsilon- global optimality within small running times using problem-specific presolving and state-of-the-art MINLP algorithms. In our modeling, we emphasize the importance of distinguishing between what we call real and imaginary flow, i.e., taking into account that the law of Darcy-Weisbach correlates pressure difference and flow along a pipe if and only if water is available at the high pressure end of a pipe. Our modeling solution extends to the dynamic operative planning problem.

Synchronization of recurrent neural networks with mixed time-delays via output coupling with delayed feedback	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS												This paper deals with the synchronization control problem for the recurrent neural networks with discrete and distributed delays. By introducing an improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing convex combination approach, a delay-dependent output feedback controller is derived to achieve synchronization with the help of a master-slave concept and linear matrix inequality approach. Moreover, the activation functions are assumed to be of more general descriptions, which generalize and improve many of those existing methods. It is worth noting that the traditional assumptions on the differentiability of the time-varying delays and the boundedness of its derivative are removed explicitly.

On controller-driven varying-sampling-rate stabilization via Lie-algebraic solvability	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS												Control systems involving shared communication networks are becoming ubiquitous. The inclusion of a communication network within a feedback loop imposes new control challenges. We consider a setting where a centralized controller/scheduler is in charge of the control of several processes and also of administering access to the shared communication network. In this setting, the controller may perform on-line variations of the sampling rate of all processes in order to accommodate for new processes requiring access to the network and to maximize performance when processes finish operation. We refer to this setting as controller-driven varying-sampling-rate (VSR). We regard a continuous-time system sampled at varying rates as a discrete-time switched system (DTSS), and aim at devising sampling-rate dependent feedback to ensure stability irrespective of the way in which the sampling rate is varied. Our feedback design strategy is based on Lie-algebraic solvability. The current paper presents two main contributions: (a) it demonstrates that control design based on Lie-algebraic solvability is much less restrictive when applied to the controller-driven VSR setting than when applied to DTSSs of arbitrary form, and (b) we give sufficient conditions for the stabilizability of the VSR-DTSS by means of the Lie-algebraic-solvability condition. As opposed to previous results, these sufficient conditions do not impose a restriction on the number of subsystems of the DTSS. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For the network under consideration, only the outputs from a fraction of nodes are available and this put forward the new challenge, that is, the so-called partial-nodes-based state estimation problem. In order to reduce the usage of the communication resources, a general eventtriggering rule is considered in the design of the estimator. A novel estimator is constructed and, by constructing novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, some easy-to-check conditions are derived such that the error dynamics is exponentially ultimately bounded. Furthermore, it is shown that the Zeno behavior can be excluded from the event-triggering rules.

Comparative analysis of discretization methods in Bayesian networks	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												A key step in implementing Bayesian networks (BNs) is the discretization of continuous variables. There are several mathematical methods for constructing discrete distributions, the implications of which on the resulting model has not been discussed in literature. Discretization invariably results in loss of information, and both the discretization method and the number of intervals determines the level of such loss. We designed an experiment to evaluate the impact of commonly used discretization methods and number of intervals on the developed BNs. The conditional probability tables, model predictions, and management recommendations were compared and shown to be different among models. However, none of the models did uniformly well in all comparison criteria. As we cannot justify using one discretization method against others, we recommend caution when discretization is used, and a verification process that includes evaluating alternative methods to ensure that the conclusions are not an artifact of the discretization approach.

Conditions for the existence of one or several paths of steady states are derived. It is shown that, in some conditions, for an external input I there may exist at least 2" exponentially stable steady states (called configuration of steady states), and their regions of attraction are estimated. This means that there exist 2" paths of exponentially stable steady states defined on a certain set of input values. Conditions assuring the transfer of a configuration of exponentially stable steady states to another configuration of exponentially stable steady states by successive changes of the external input are obtained.

We study the coverage of a line interval with a set of wireless sensors with adjustable coverage ranges. Each coverage range of a sensor is an interval centered at that sensor whose length is decided by the power the sensor chooses. The objective is to find a range assignment with the minimum cost. There are two variants of the optimization problem. In the discrete variant, each sensor can only choose from a finite set of powers, whereas in the continuous variant, each sensor can choose power from a given interval. For the discrete variant of the problem, a polynomial-time exact algorithm is designed. For the continuous variant of the problem, NP-hardness of the problem is proved and followed by an ILP formulation. Then, constant-approximation algorithms are designed when the cost for all sensors is proportional to r(k) for some constant k >= 1, where r is the covering radius corresponding to the chosen power. Specifically, if k = 1, we give a 1.25-approximation algorithm and a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme; if k > 1, we give a 2-approximation algorithm. We also show that the approximation analyses are tight.					; Li, Minming/L-9676-2013	ZHAO, Yingchao/0000-0001-8362-6735; Li, Minming/0000-0002-7370-6237													1550-4859	1550-4867				NOV	2014	11	1							14	10.1145/2629518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2629518													WOS:000345012500014

A NOVEL METHOD FOR DESIGNING AND OPTIMIZATION OF NETWORKS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING												In this paper, system planning network is formulated with mixed-integer programming. Two meta-heuristic procedures are considered for this problem. The cost function of this problem consists of the capital investment cost in discrete form, the cost of transmission losses and the power generation costs. The DC load flow equations for the network are embedded in the constraints of the mathematical model to avoid sub-optimal solutions that can arise if the enforcement of such constraints is done in an indirect way. The solution of the model gives the best line additions, and also provides information regarding the optimal generation at each generation point. This method of solution is demonstrated on the expansion of a 5 bus-bar system to 6 bus-bars.																			1025-2495	1735-9244				FEB	2007	20	1					17	26																WOS:000444839300002

Operational planning framework for multisite production and distribution networks	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												The operational planning of a multisite production and distribution network, which entails making operational-level decisions for efficient production facility utilitization and customer-order fulfillment over a time horizon of several months, is of great importance but has received considerably less attention compared to operational planning approaches for a single production site. The inherent complexities of simultaneously optimizing the allocation of production tasks at each facility, as well as the interplay between several production and distribution centers make operational planning of a multisite production and distribution network challenging especially when addressing large-scale, industrial applications. The proposed multisite planning with production disaggregation model (Multisite-PPDM) has been formulated in order to address industrially relevant supply chains and determine both the production and shipment profiles for the supply chain of interest.

J	Zhou, J; Chen, YL; Liang, GC; Zhou, LL				Zhou, Jun; Chen, Yulin; Liang, Guangchuan; Zhou, Liuling			A station location-allocation optimization problem in star-star pipeline network layout	PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The oil and gas field surface gathering pipeline network is an important hub for transporting oil and gas products outward, and its optimal design is crucial to reducing the construction cost of the pipeline system. Star-star topology is often applied to the layout of surface gathering pipeline networks in oil and gas fields. However, the optimization of star-star topology is often carried out under the constraint of the fixed station type, which may easily lead to a waste of station capacity and increase investment or make the optimization results meaningless. In this article, a mixed integer linear programming mathematical model for the overall optimization of star-star pipeline network layout considering the station location-allocation problem is constructed in discrete space with coupled station type constraints, and the branch-and-bound method is used to obtain the global optimal solution. Three cases verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model and algorithm. The results show that the maximum avoided capacity waste is 20 x 104 m3/d and the maximum investment can be reduced by 8961.6 x 104 Yuan, which shows that the proposed model can effectively improve the economy and rationality of the pipeline system, and has important guiding significance for the construction of oil and gas fields.																			1091-6466	1532-2459				JUL 17	2024	42	14					1745	1765		10.1080/10916466.2022.2147944	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10916466.2022.2147944													WOS:001240233500002

We propose a distributed coordination algorithm that allows the robots to decide whether a desired collective motion breaks connectivity. We build on this procedure to design a second coordination algorithm that allows the robots to modify a desired collective motion to guarantee that connectivity is preserved. These algorithms work under imperfect information caused by delays in communication and the robots' mobility. Under very outdated information, the proposed algorithms might prevent some or all of the robots from moving. We analyze the correctness of our algorithms by formulating them as games against a hypothetical adversary who chooses system states consistent with observed information. The technical approach combines tools from algebraic graph theory, linear algebra, and nonsmooth analysis.

J	Frank, LD; Andresen, MA; Schmid, TL				Frank, LD; Andresen, MA; Schmid, TL			Obesity relationships with community design, physical activity, and time spent in cars	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE												Background: Obesity is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. To date, relationships between obesity and aspects of the built environment have not been evaluated empirically at the individual level. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between the built environment around each participant's place of residence and self-reported travel patterns (walking and time in a car), body mass index (BMI), and obesity for specific gender and ethnicity classifications. Methods: Body Mass Index, minutes spent in a car, kilometers walked, age, income, educational attainment, and gender were derived through a travel survey of 10,878 participants in the Atlanta, Georgia region. Objective measures of land use mix, net residential density, and street connectivity were developed within a 1-kilometer network distance of each participant's place of residence. A cross-sectional design was used to associate urban form measures with obesity, BMI, and transportation-related activity when adjusting for socio-demographic covariates. Discrete analyses were conducted across gender and ethnicity. The data were collected between 2000 and 2002 and analysis was conducted in 2004. Results: Land-use mix had the strongest association with obesity (BMIgreater than or equal to30 kg/m(2)), with each quartile increase being associated with a 12.2% reduction in the likelihood of obesity across gender and ethnicity. Each additional hour spent in a car per day was associated with a 6% increase in the likelihood of obesity. Conversely, each additional kilometer walked per day was associated with a 4.8% reduction in the likelihood of obesity. As a continuous measure, BMI was significantly associated with urban form for white cohorts. Relationships among urban form, walk distance, and time in a car were stronger among white than black cohorts. Conclusions: Measures of the built environment and travel patterns are important predictors of obesity across gender and ethnicity, yet relationships among the built environment, travel patterns, and weight may vary across gender and ethnicity. Strategies to increase land-use mix and distance walked while reducing time in a car can be effective as health interventions. (C) 2004 American journal of Preventive Medicine.

By constructing a set of appropriated Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and employing Newton-Leibniz formulation and free weighting matrix method, some dissipativity criteria that are dependent on the upper and lower bounds of the time-varying delays are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily verified via the LMI toolbox.

However, it falls short in providing a justifiable and reliable solution for deciding the target architecture. In particular, the design choice of a certain operation at each layer/edge is determined without considering the distribution of operations over the overall architecture or even the neighboring layers. Our method explores such dependencies from the viewpoint of maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation. The consideration takes account of both local and global information by learning transition probabilities of network operations while enabling a greedy scheme to uncover a MAP estimate of optimal target architecture. The experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular benchmark datasets and also can be conveniently plugged into DARTS-related techniques to boost their performance.

Each TiOx oxidation step has been carefully investigated with different analytical techniques, including high resolution transmission electron microscopy/ high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRTEM/ HRSEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. The self-assembly of TiOx nanoparticles (NPs) into 1D supramolecular nanoparticle networks is induced by the formation of mixed valent Ti-II,Ti- III species. The synthesis starts with etching a bare Ti surface, followed by a continuous oxidation of TiOx clusters and NPs, and it finally ends with the self-assembly into rigid 1D NPs chains. Today, such self-assembled 1D NP TiOx network materials are bridging the gap between the nanoscale and the macroscopic material world and will further provide interesting research opportunities.

An uncertain continuous Takagi-Sueeno (T-S) fuzzy system with both state and input varying delays, in the presence of possible actuator faults, is obtained equivalently on the basis of the input delay methodology. A tighter bounding lemma is proposed so as to gain less conservative closed-loop stability criteria. Delay-dependent conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived for the mode-independent fault-tolerant stabilizing controller of the resulting Markovian network-based system by employing a novel stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional.

In designing and controlling such a system, one must decide on the number and location of computer facilities, the allocation of multiple data files to facilities, and the user access paths to the data files. A mixed-integer programming formulation and dual-based solution procedure for this problem are described, and the results of computational experiments with realistic-sized problems are reported. Optimal solutions for problems with approximately 2,000 integer decision variables and 76,000 continuous decision variables are found in less than 30 CPU seconds, demonstrating the large-scale capability of the model and algorithm.

Hebbian neural networks are employed in communications and signal processing applications for implementing on-line Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Different improvements over the original Oja model have been developed in the last two decades. Among them, models with lateral weights have been designed to directly provide the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix [1,5,6,9]. The behavior of hebbian models has been traditionally studied by resorting to an associated continuous-time formulation under some questionable assumptions which are not guaranteed in real implementations. In this paper we employ the alternative deterministic discrete-time (DDT) formulation that characterizes the average evolution of these nets and gathers the influence of the learning gains time evolution [12]. The dynamic behavior of some of these hebbian models is analytically characterized in this context and several simulations complement this comparative study.

Markovian jump parameters are modeled as a continuous-time and finite-state Markov chain. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation, new delay-dependent stability conditions are established to ascertain the mean-square asymptotic stability result of the equilibrium point. The reciprocally convex combination technique, Jensen's inequality, and the Wirtinger-based double integral inequality are used to handle single and double integral terms in the time derivative of the LKF.

Formation Static Output Control of Linear Multi-Agent Systems With Hidden Markov Switching Network Topologies	IEEE ACCESS												This paper addresses the H-2,H-infinity and mixed H-2/H-infinity formation static output control of continuous-time linear multi-agent systems with Markovian switching network topologies. It is assumed that the operation mode of the network topology cannot be directly measured but, instead, can be estimated by an imperfect detector. To model this problem, we consider a continuous-time hidden Markov model, in which the hidden component represents the real operation mode of the network topology while the observed component represents the information emitted from the detector and available for the controller. It is also assumed that only a partial information from the state variables of the multi-agent systems is available. By using an LMI (linear matrix inequality) formulation, a distributed static output controller which switches according to the detector information is designed to guarantee the stability in the mean square sense of the closed loop system, as well as an upper-bound for an index performance. Three situations are considered for the performance criteria: the H-2 norm, the H-infinity norm, and the mixed H-2/H-infinity norms. The paper is concluded with a numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

Our recent Wireless Sensor Network deployment in the Burdekin delta, Australia, for water monitoring [T. Le Dinh, W. Hu, P. Sikka, P. Corke, L Overs, S. Brosnan, Design and deployment of a remote robust sensor network: experiences from an outdoor water quality monitoring network, in: Second IEEE Workshop on Practical Issues in Building Sensor Network Applications (SenseApp 2007), Dublin, Ireland, 2007] is one such example. This application involves streaming sensed data such as pressure, water flow rate, and salinity periodically from many scattered sensors to the sink node which in turn relays them via an IP network to a remote site for archiving, processing, and presentation. While latency is not a primary concern in this class of application (the sampling rate is usually in terms of minutes or hours), energy-efficiency is. Continuous long-term operation and reliable delivery of the sensed data to the sink are also desirable. This paper proposes ERTP, an Energy-efficient and Reliable Transport Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks. ERTP is designed for data streaming applications, in which sensor readings are transmitted from one or more sensor sources to a base station (or sink). ERTP uses a statistical reliability metric which ensures the number of data packets delivered to the sink exceeds the defined threshold. Our extensive discrete event simulations and experimental evaluations show that ERTP is significantly more energy-efficient than current approaches and can reduce energy consumption by more than 45% when compared to current approaches. Consequently, sensor nodes are more energy-efficient and the lifespan of the unattended WSN is increased. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the NBC has two key limitations: (1) it is built upon the strong assumption that condition attributes are independent, which often does not hold in real-life, and (2) the NBC does not handle continuous attributes well. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel approach for NBC construction, called mixed-attribute fusion-based NBC (MAF-NBC). It alleviates the two aforementioned limitations by relying on a mixed-attribute fusion mechanism with an improved autoencoder neural network for NBC construction. MAF-NBC transforms the original mixed attributes of a data set into a series of encoded attributes with maximum independence as a pre-processing step. To guarantee the generation of useful encoded attributes, an efficient objective function is designed to optimize the weights of the autoencoder neural network by considering both the encoding error and the attribute's dependence. A series of persuasive experiments was conducted to validate the feasibility, rationality, and effectiveness of the designed MAF-NBC approach. Results demonstrate that MAF-NBC has superior classification performance than eight state-of-the-art Bayesian algorithms, namely the discretization-based NBC (Dis-NBC), flexible naive Bayes (FNB), tree-augmented naive (TAN) Bayes, averaged one-dependent estimator (AODE), hidden naive Bayes (HNB), deep feature weighting for NBC (DFW-NBC), correlation-based feature weighting filter for NBC (CFW-NBC), and independent component analysis-based NBC (ICA-NBC).

J	Kobayashi, K; Hiraishi, K				Kobayashi, Koichi; Hiraishi, Kunihiko			A Probabilistic Approach to Control of Complex Systems and Its Application to Real-Time Pricing	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												Control of complex systems is one of the fundamental problems in control theory. In this paper, a control method for complex systems modeled by a probabilistic Boolean network (PBN) is studied. A PBN is widely used as a model of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks. For a PBN, the structural control problem is newly formulated. In this problem, a discrete probability distribution appeared in a PBN is controlled by the continuous-valued input. For this problem, an approximate solution method using a matrix-based representation for a PBN is proposed. Then, the problem is approximated by a linear programming problem. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to design of real-time pricing systems of electricity. Electricity conservation is achieved by appropriately determining the electricity price over time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is presented by a numerical example on real-time pricing systems.

State estimator for neural networks with sampled data using discontinuous Lyapunov functional approach	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS												In this paper, the sampled-data state estimation problem is investigated for neural networks with time-varying delays. Instead of the continuous measurement, the sampled measurement is used to estimate the neuron states, and a sampled data estimator is constructed. Based on the extended Wirtinger inequality, a discontinuous Lyapunov functional is introduced, which makes full use of the sawtooth structure characteristic of sampling input delay. New delay-dependent criteria are developed to estimate the neuron states through available output measurements such that the estimation error system is asymptotically stable. The criteria are formulated in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be checked efficiently by use of some standard numerical packages. Finally, a numerical example and its simulations are given to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the presented results.					shen, hao/HGF-0551-2022; Park, Ju H./J-8796-2012; Shanmugam, Lakshmanan/Z-6134-2019; Rakkiyappan, R./D-6737-2013	Park, Ju H./0000-0002-0218-2333; Shanmugam, Lakshmanan/0000-0002-4622-3782; Rakkiyappan, R./0000-0003-0809-2782													0924-090X	1573-269X				JUL	2013	73	1-2					509	520		10.1007/s11071-013-0805-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-013-0805-z													WOS:000320954900041

This research designs a location privacy system of n-player game that analyses the behaviour of mobile nodes in the network. Each player aims at maximizing its location privacy at minimum cost by strategically choosing series of actions in the game. The design was simulated using Java programming language configured on Windows 7 platform. The results of the games played were presented with analysis showing the strategies chosen by the mobile nodes. The players had opportunity of choosing perfect strategies as the number of players participating in the game increases thus, enhance the level of location privacy achieved by the players.

Finding optimal locations of charging stations for BEBs can facilitate the development of electric transit networks that provide continuous services. Using fast charging along with Energy Storage (ES) charger technologies has also garnered attention to mitigate the peak power demand. A consensus regarding two types of chargers may result in more investment in the electric transit network, which resulted in considering installing fast chargers in designing an electric transit network. While this study aims to consider two types of fast- and ES-chargers, along with demand charges and waiting times at terminal stops simultaneously, to minimize the total costs of the electric transit network. The queuing model integrated with the Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model is proposed to locate the optimal placements of charging stations in the electric transit network. To validate the model, a benchmark Mumford0 network is applied. Results indicated that the proposed charging location model could efficiently determine optimal locations of fast- and ES-chargers across the electric transit network. Also, the results confirmed that considering ES chargers could significantly save 16.6 % of the total costs of the Mumford0 transit network and reduce the total demand charge imposed on the network by the fast charger. More interestingly, by purchasing more chargers, transit agencies can decide on an acceptable waiting time that would be comfortable for BEBs arriving at terminal stops.

J	Poveda, JI; Teel, AR				Poveda, Jorge I.; Teel, Andrew R.			Hybrid mechanisms for robust synchronization and coordination of multi-agent networked sampled-data systems	AUTOMATICA												We present a novel approach for the design of robust feedback coordination and control mechanisms for networks of asynchronous nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS). Each agent corresponds to a sampled data system characterized by a continuous-time plant, a discrete-time controller with logic or integer states, and a sampler/zero-order hold with a local clock. The goal is to robustly stabilize an application dependent compact set defined a priori for the MAS, taking into account the asynchronous nature of the triggering mechanisms of the agents, and the limited information in the network. To solve this problem, we propose an emulation-like approach, where the feedback mechanism for each agent is initially designed for a nominal ideal synchronous MAS with a single logic state. Unlike existing emulation results for networked sampled-data systems with a single triggering mechanism, the implementation of multiple triggering mechanisms in MAS requires additional decentralized coordination algorithms to guarantee that the implemented system robustly emulates the behavior of the nominal synchronous system. Therefore, we propose a decentralized synchronization and coordination mechanism that controls the triggering mechanisms of the agents, guaranteeing robust stabilization of the closed-loop MAS. Our results are established by using Lyapunov tools, the invariance principle, and robustness corollaries for set-valued hybrid dynamical systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we consider delay optimal control of a two-hop half-duplex network with independent identically distributed ON-OFF fading. Both the source node and the relay node are equipped with infinite buffers and have exogenous bit arrivals. We focus on delay optimal link selection to minimize the average sum queue length over a finite horizon subject to a half-duplex constraint. To solve the problem, we introduce a new approach, whereby an actual discrete time system (ADTS) is approximated using a virtual continuous time system (VCTS). We obtain an asymptotically delay optimal policy in the VCTS. Using the relationship between the VCTS and the ADTS, we obtain an asymptotically delay optimal policy in the ADTS. The obtained policy has both a priority feature and a safety stock feature. It offers good design insights for wireless relay networks. In addition, the obtained policy has a closed-form expression, does not require knowledge of arrival statistics, and can be implemented online. Finally, using renewal theory and the theory of random walks, we analyze the average delay resulting from the asymptotically delay optimal policy.

The technique, which is based on mixed-mode active load-pull measurements, predicts power amplifier (PA) performance while avoiding the need to manufacture the complete PA. The method is based on an iterative procedure using transistor/branch PA active load-pull measurements together with the S-parameters of the load network. Advantageously, real world performance of the complete differential PA can be evaluated in the design stage. Thereby, many different output combiners and configurations, e.g., biases, transistors, and branch phases, can be fully evaluated without fabrication. Compared to prior art, the method requires only a single representative device-under-test, while providing flexibility in the input signal and the target load network. Thus, a novel powerful measurement tool for PA designers is presented. The technique is demonstrated by performing mixed-mode load-pull and emulating a differential amplifier at 2.14 GHz using continuous wave signals.

While the continuous relaxation is closely related to the original integer program, its optimal solution is often fractional. Thus, the success of a relaxation depends crucially on the availability of an accurate rounding procedure. The problem of identifying an accurate rounding procedure has mainly been tackled in the theoretical computer science community through mathematical analysis of the worst-case. However, this approach is both onerous and ignores the distribution of the data encountered in practice. We present a novel interpretation of rounding procedures as sampling from a latent variable model, which opens the door to the use of powerful machine learning formulations in their design. Inspired by the recent success of deep latent variable models we parameterize rounding procedures as a neural network, which lends itself to efficient optimization via back-propagation. By minimizing the expected value of the objective of the discrete labeling problem over training samples, we learn a rounding procedure that is more suited to the task at hand. Using both synthetic and real world data sets, we demonstrate that our approach can outperform the state-of-the-art hand-designed rounding procedures.

A.; Schmeink, Anke			Accurate optimization models for interference constrained bandwidth allocation in cellular networks	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												In cellular networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is a key metric for link availability and quality. For network planning purposes, a straightforward modeling unfortunately yields numerically difficult optimization models. Further, given a required data rate of a link, its bandwidth consumption depends nonlinearly on the SINR. In this paper, we develop two novel approaches to jointly model SINR-based link availability and bandwidth requirements accurately. The first approach is a set-wise formulation from a user's point of view, while the second one exploits discrete channel quality indicators. We compare these formulations with three known approximate approaches numerically, revealing the clear outperformance of our approaches in terms of exactness. Moreover, since the exact models comprise an exponential number of either variables or constraints, we discuss their pros and cons in a further computational study and develop a more efficient algorithm dealing implicitly with the involved constraints.

Firstly, a reconstructed jump model for interconnected power systems is proposed by taking the circumstance of data packet loss into consideration, which caused by the stochastic transmission delay of sampled data. Then, different from the traditional continuous-type PID control, an observer-based discrete-type PID control strategy is designed for discrete-time power system. Besides, due to the sampled data may be tampered or shield in open communication networks, the hybrid attacks, i.e., deception attacks and denial-of-service attacks, with random manners are considered. Furthermore, an input-to-state stable criterion is derived by constructing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals.

It allows better resource utilization, increases user throughput and extends the battery life of user equipment compared the conventional cellular network. The fundamental challenge in D2D communications is how to allocate spectral bands and control transmission power optimally, in order to ensure the quality of service (QoS) and increase the energy efficiency. This problem is mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) due to the discrete variables. In this paper, we consider the joint power control and channel allocation for underlying D2D communications. We formulated the optimization problem in the form of an iterative combinatorial auction. The proposed algorithm is designed with two rounds. In the first round, each bidder submits its offer for each channel. In the second round, the goal is to improve the results obtained in the first round by considering the interference received from other users. The system power consumption and network lifetime were evaluated through simulations.

Only two different sampling periods are considered which occurrence probabilities are given constants and satisfy Bernoulli distribution. By applying an input-delay approach, the probabilistic sampling state estimator is transformed into a continuous time-delay system with stochastic parameters in the system matrices, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements. Delay-dependent asymptotically stability condition is established for the system of the estimation error, which can be readily solved by using the LMI toolbox in MATIAB, the solvability of derived conditions depends on not only the size of the delay and the sampling period, but also the probability of taking values of the sampling period.

These models propagate traffic according to Daganzo's cell transmission model. Two Monte Carlo bounding techniques, common random numbers (CRN) and independent random numbers (IRN) strategies, are used to solve the stochastic models. The results show that the CRN strategy outperforms IRN on a simple test network resembling a freeway corridor. The network size is sacrificed to gain higher confidence probabilistic behavior and to understand intuitively the effects of different network improvement policies. Although the findings may not necessarily be generalized, they provide interesting and insightful information. First, the SO and UO models allocate investment differently for certain budgets, and the stochastic models may lead to an erroneous solution (i.e., a bottleneck) for some budgets. Subsequently, the results of three comparison cases are discussed: (a) for the SO models, it should be more valuable to solve the stochastic than the deterministic models, but it is not always the case for the UO models; (b) the SO models appear more desirable than the UO models for single-level analysis; and (c) it should be more valuable to solve the stochastic model accounting for more randomness.

Thus, a transition to continuous supply is an option that must be studied. Nevertheless, many water companies have not enough resources to produce the big investments necessary for a direct transition. Consequently, we propose a gradual transition process based on optimal sector selection at the various network upgrading stages of the process, while considering the possibility of simultaneously having continuous and intermittent supplied sectors. We ultimately seek every sector to have continuous supply at the end of the process. Sector selection takes into account qualitative and quantitative criteria, which guarantees equity for still intermittent sectors, benefiting the highest number of users, and facilitating water company operation tasks. Thereby, it is possible to achieve a planned transition that meets water company economical limitations. The problem of optimal sector selection is a computational complex task, since it deals with a non-linear problem with mixed decision variables and is affected by uncertainty and qualitative criteria.

This work contributes to the literature of dynamic maximum flow interdiction problems by addressing multiple commodities in a network of relationships. The related distribution network consists of (1) criminals, who are hierarchically connected, and seeking to maximize the total profit flow from origins to destinations, and (2) enforcement officers aiming to minimize criminals' long-term success by monitoring and arresting them, using the limited resources at their disposal. Considering several real-world operational details, we first propose a mixed-integer programming model by reformulating a MM-Max bi-level mathematical model. We then propose a new formulation and discuss its efficiency compared with the traditional duality-based reformulation. This new formulation also has a higher compatibility with decomposition solution methods. Utilizing the new formulation, we design a solution method based on the Benders decomposition procedure and apply several accelerating strategies (e.g., Super Valid Inequalities) to solve larger instances for a better representation of reality. Lastly, we create a heuristic method based on real-world evidence, which is usually practiced by law enforcement officers. Our results show that the quality of the heuristic method declines quickly as the network size increases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sensors are selected based on their contribution to information gain with respect to FDI. Admissible input trajectories are selected that maximize the sensitivity of sensed outputs with respect to faults and minimize the joint confidence between faults and sources of uncertainty. The methodology is intended for active FDI in systems that are limited to a finite number of input design scenarios. The optimization of discrete sensors and input designs is formulated as a constrained mixed non-linear integer problem that maximizes a measure of Fisher Information, which is based on output sensitivities with respect to faults and uncertainty represented as parameters in the system model. FDI tests are executed using k-nearest neighbor classification, which is used as a verification method for test designs and sensor networks that result in high correct classification rates. The proposed design framework is tested on a virtual benchmark three-tank system, subject to multiple faults and sources of uncertainty.																			1570-7946		978-0-12-818597-1				2019	47						335	340		10.1016/B978-0-12-818597-1.50053-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818597-1.50053-9													WOS:000495451900053
J	Qian, H; Huang, WJ; Tu, SK; Xu, L				Qian, Hao; Huang, Wenjing; Tu, Shikui; Xu, Lei			KGDiff: towards explainable target-aware molecule generation with knowledge guidance	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS												Designing 3D molecules with high binding affinity for specific protein targets is crucial in drug design. One challenge is that the atomic interaction between molecules and proteins in 3D space has to be taken into account. However, the existing target-aware methods solely model the joint distribution between the molecules and proteins, disregarding the binding affinities between them, which leads to limited performance. In this paper, we propose an explainable diffusion model to generate molecules that can be bound to a given protein target with high affinity. Our method explicitly incorporates the chemical knowledge of protein-ligand binding affinity into the diffusion model, and uses the knowledge to guide the denoising process towards the direction of high binding affinity. Specifically, an SE(3)-invariant expert network is developed to fit the Vina scoring functions and jointly trained with the denoising network, while the domain knowledge is distilled and conveyed from Vina functions to the expert network. An effective guidance is proposed on both continuous atom coordinates and discrete atom types by taking advantages of the gradient of the expert network. Experiments on the benchmark CrossDocked2020 demonstrate the superiority of our method. Additionally, an atom-level explanation of the generated molecules is provided, and the connections with the domain knowledge are established.																			1467-5463	1477-4054				JAN	2024	25	1							bbad435	10.1093/bib/bbad435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbad435								38040493					WOS:001185460900001

AI-Based Mobility-Aware Energy Efficient Resource Allocation and Trajectory Design for NFV Enabled Aerial Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING												In this paper, we propose a novel joint intelligent trajectory design and resource allocation algorithm based on users' mobility and their requested services for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted networks, where UAVs act as nodes of a network function virtualization (NFV) enabled network. Our objective is to maximize energy efficiency and minimize the average delay on all services by allocating the limited radio and NFV resources. In addition, due to the traffic conditions and mobility of users, we let some virtual network functions (VNFs) migrate from their current locations to other locations to satisfy the Quality of Service requirements. We formulate our problem to find near-optimal locations of UAVs, transmit power, subcarrier assignment, VNF placement, and VNF scheduling over the UAVs and perform suitable VNF migration. Then we propose a novel hierarchical hybrid continuous and discrete action (HHCDA) deep reinforcement learning method to solve the proposed problem. Finally, the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and its performance is analyzed for different parameters. Simulation results show that our proposed HHCDA method decreases the average end-to-end delay by 31.5% and increases the energy efficiency by 40% compared to the state-of-the-art Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient method.

By applying the famous finite-time stability theory, combining differential inequality techniques, and the analysis approach, several new algebraic sufficient criteria are obtained to realize finite-time synchronization between the drive system and the response system by designing a state feedback controller and an adaptive controller. Taking discrete delays, distributed delays, and uncertain nonlinear perturbations into account in fuzzy cellular neural networks makes the neural system more general than most existing cellular neural networks. Two different novel types of controllers designed to achieve finite-time synchronization can not only effectively overcome the influence of time delays and perturbations but also change their form according to the change of system state or perturbation to achieve a better control effect. Meanwhile, some algebraic sufficient criteria obtained in this paper can be proved by the parameters of the system itself, and the complex calculation of matrix inequality is avoided. Finally, the validity of our proposed results is confirmed by several examples and simulations. Furthermore, a secure communication problem is presented to further illustrate the fact of the obtained results.

Stochastic Sampled-Data Control for Exponential Synchronization of Markovian Jumping Complex Dynamical Networks with Mode-Dependent Time-Varying Coupling Delay	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING												In this paper, we address the problem of exponential synchronization of Markovian jumping complex dynamical networks with mode-dependent time-varying coupling delay via a stochastic sampled-data controller. In addition, the sampling period is assumed to be time-varying and switches between different values in a random way with given probability. By constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple integral terms and by employing convex combination technique and free weighting matrices method, sufficient conditions for the coupled complex dynamical network to be globally exponentially synchronized in the mean square sense are derived. The information about the lower bound of the discrete time-varying delay is used in the LKF. Based on the derived condition, the desired sampled-data feedback controller is designed in terms of the solution to linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

The data collected from infrasound microphones are presented online by the infrasound monitoring system operating in Northern Europe, i.e., the Swedish-Finnish Infrasound Network (SFIN). Processing the continuous flow of data to extract optimal feature information is important for real-time signal classification. Performing wavelet decomposition on the real-time signals is an alternative. The purpose of this paper is to present the design and FPGA implementation of discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) for real-time infrasound data processing; our approach uses only two FIR filters, a high-pass and a low-pass filter. A compact implementation was realized with pipelining techniques and multiple use of generalized building blocks. The design was described in VHDL and the FPGA implementation and simulation were performed on the QUARTUS II platform.																			0018-9499	1558-1578				FEB	2008	55	1	1				9	13		10.1109/TNS.2007.914322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2007.914322													WOS:000253224700003

The mixed time delays comprise both discrete and distributed delays that occur frequently in signal transmissions among artificial neurons. Measurement outputs are sometimes subject to abnormal disturbances (resulting probably from sensor aging/outages/faults/failures and unpredictable environmental changes) leading to measurement outliers that would deteriorate the estimation performance if directly taken into the innovation in the estimator design. We propose to use a certain confidence-dependent saturation function to mitigate the side effects from the measurement outliers on the estimation error dynamics (EEDs). Through using a combination of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and inequality manipulations, a delay-dependent criterion is established for the existence of the outlier-resistant state estimator ensuring that the corresponding EED achieves the asymptotic stability with a prescribed H-infinity performance index. Then, the explicit characterization of the estimator gain is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Finally, numerical simulation is carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of the derived theoretical results.

Unifying the design space and optimizing linear and nonlinear truss metamaterials by generative modeling	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The rise of machine learning has fueled the discovery of new materials and, especially, metamaterials-truss lattices being their most prominent class. While their tailorable properties have been explored extensively, the design of truss-based metamaterials has remained highly limited and often heuristic, due to the vast, discrete design space and the lack of a comprehensive parameterization. We here present a graph-based deep learning generative framework, which combines a variational autoencoder and a property predictor, to construct a reduced, continuous latent representation covering an enormous range of trusses. This unified latent space allows for the fast generation of new designs through simple operations (e.g., traversing the latent space or interpolating between structures). We further demonstrate an optimization framework for the inverse design of trusses with customized mechanical properties in both the linear and nonlinear regimes, including designs exhibiting exceptionally stiff, auxetic, pentamode-like, and tailored nonlinear behaviors. This generative model can predict manufacturable (and counter-intuitive) designs with extreme target properties beyond the training domain. Truss metamaterials are ubiquitous but their vast design space is far from fully explored. Here, authors use machine learning to present a unified, continuous latent space description, enabling the rapid generation of trusses with tunable or exceptional linear and nonlinear mechanical properties.

In most existing results, the distributed controller for collective motion coordination is designed in the continuous-time domain in order to conform to the continuous kinetic dynamics of vehicle systems, and discretization of the continuous controller is used in implementation since the information can only be exchanged at discrete-time instants among these systems. However, this approach cannot guarantee the original design performance since discretization may harm or even destabilize the closed-loop system. Inspired by pulse based synchronization among biological pulse-coupled oscillators, we propose an integrated communication and control approach for collective motion coordination which can circumvent discretization and guarantee the design performance in final implementation. Not only can heading control be achieved to coordinate vehicle headings, but also spacing control is achievable for the circular motion. Numerical simulations are provided to confirm the theoretical results. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

One approach to avoid this is to train a neural network on data-set of solutions of MPC problems (potentially nonlinear) offline, and to evaluate the trained control policy online. However, due to the separation of these optimisation problems the neural network controller must be carefully verified to ensure adequate closed loop performance. In this paper we propose a method train a neural network in closed loop for control systems, in continuous or discrete time, while allowing flexible consideration of parametric uncertainty. This method does not require off-line solutions of the NMPC problem, and instead directly optimises the desired closed loop performance. We prove that our method can approximate the optimal closed-loop control policy to arbitrary tolerance and in numerical examples demonstrate its performance compared to explicit MPC, imitation learning and nominal MPC.

Each subnetwork is represented by a fixed and directed graph. Moreover, the agents in each cluster cannot communicate with agents from other clusters, except one single agent of each subnetwork, which is called a leader. These leaders interact at some instant times via fixed and strongly connected directed graph. This paper proposes a consensus protocol that takes into account the continuous-time communications among agents in the clusters and discrete information exchanges between clusters. Based on this proposed protocol, the collective network dynamics of the multi-agent systems is described in the term of hybrid systems. The characterization of the global consensus value of this kind of networks is analyzed. Secondly, we show that the problem of consensus design can be indirectly solved by considering the stability of an equivalent system. Then, a sufficient condition for the asymptotical stability of this equivalent system is proposed.

Our construction is based on careful modeling of visual sensing quality that is consistent with the physical nature of cameras, and we introduce a new notion of conic Voronoi diagrams, based on our sensing quality measures, to solve the camera network allocation problem: that is, to determine where each camera should focus in its field of view given all the other cameras' configurations. Accordingly, we design simple greedy gradient algorithms for both continuous- and discrete-time first-order PTZ camera dynamics that asymptotically converge a locally optimal coverage configuration. Finally, we provide numerical and experimental evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed coverage algorithms.

In recent years, there has been particular interest in the simultaneous use of continuous and discrete domains, obviating the need for discretization, using so-called hybrid BNs. In these hybrid environments, Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials (MTEs) provide a suitable solution for working without any restriction. The objective of this study is the assessment of groundwater quality through the design and application of a probabilistic clustering, based on hybrid Bayesian networks with MTEs. Firstly, the results obtained allows the differentiation of three groups of sampling points, indicating three different classes of groundwater quality. Secondly, the probability that a sampling point belongs to each cluster allows the uncertainty in the clusters to be assessed, as well as the risks associated in terms of water quality management. The methodology developed could be applied to other fields in environmental sciences.

The environmental impact is evaluated via benchmarking. By using benchmarking, the decision maker can have an insight, not only into the environmental impacts of certain designs belonging to Pareto optimal solutions, but also into the competitiveness of the design within a particular production sector. The economic criterion used is the total cost of the water network involving the freshwater cost, wastewater treatment cost, and the annual investment costs of storage tank, piping, and local treatment unit installation. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is used for water re-use and regeneration re-use within batch and semi-continuous processes. The Pareto fronts are generated using the classic and adaptive weighted-sum methods. The proposed approach was applied to an industrial case study within a brewery. The results obtained show that the benchmark could not be reached by process integration within the packaging area, therefore investment is needed regarding new technologies that lower freshwater consumption. Within the production area, however, the freshwater consumption could be reduced below the benchmark by water re-use and regeneration re-use, meaning that the brewery could achieve better performance than its competitors.

A High-Accuracy of Transmission Line Faults (TLFs) Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS												To improve power system reliability, a protection mechanism is highly needed. Early detection can be used to prevent failures in the power transmission line (TL). A classification system method is widely used to protect against false detection as well as assist the decision analysis. Each TL signal has a continuous pattern in which it can be detected and classified by the conventional methods, i.e., wavelet feature extraction and artificial neural network (ANN). However, the accuracy resulting from these mentioned models is relatively low. To overcome this issue, we propose a machine learning-based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the transmission line faults (TLFs) application. CNN is more suitable for pattern recognition compared to conventional ANN and ANN with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) feature extraction. In this work, we first simulate our proposed model by using Simulink (R) and Matlab (R). This simulation generates a fault signal dataset, which is divided into 45.738 data training and 4.752 data tests. Later, we design the number of machine learning classifiers. Each model classifier is trained by exposing it to the same dataset. The CNN design, with raw input, is determined as an optimal output model from the training process with 100% accuracy.

The controller to be designed allows for mode mismatch with the plant, and the mode mismatch behavior is described by a hidden Markov model. The conditional probabilities are permitted to be uncertain, which belong to an interval with precise upper and lower bounds. A sufficient condition that ensures the stochastic stability and H-infinity disturbance-attenuation performance of the system is derived by employing a Lyapunov functional involving multiple quadratic items associated with the system modes. Then, two design methods are proposed for the desired controller. The first method does not utilize the property that the row sum of the conditional probability matrix is one, while the second method incorporates this property into the design process. The scenario where all the conditional probabilities are known in advance is also investigated, and corresponding controller design methods are presented. Finally, two examples are applied to validate the effectiveness of the design methods.

Single-commodity robust network design problem: Complexity, instances and heuristic solutions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												We study a single-commodity Robust Network Design problem (RND) in which an undirected graph with edge costs is given together with a discrete set of balance matrices, representing different supply/demand scenarios. In each scenario, a subset of the nodes is exchanging flow. The goal is to determine the minimum cost installation of capacities on the edges such that the flow exchange is feasible for every scenario. Previously conducted computational investigations on the problem motivated the study of the complexity of some special cases and we present complexity results on them, including hypercubes. In turn, these results lead to the definition of new instances (random graphs with {-1,0,1} balances) that are computationally hard for the natural flow formulation. These instances are then solved by means of a new heuristic algorithm for RND, which consists of three phases. In the first phase the graph representing the network is reduced by heuristically deleting a subset of the arcs, and a feasible solution is built. The second phase consists of a neighborhood search on the reduced graph based on a Mixed-Integer (Linear) Programming (MIP) flow model. Finally, the third phase applies a proximity search approach to further improve the solution, taking into account the original graph. The heuristic is tested on the new instances, and the comparison with the solutions obtained by Cplex on a natural flow formulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

These BMSs inform the medical staff in advance before the patient's life goes into a threatening situation. In WBAN, routing layer has the same challenges as generally seen in WSN, but the unique requirements of WBANs need to be addressed by the novel routing mechanisms quite differently from the routing mechanism in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The slots allocation to emergency and nonemergency patient's data is one of the challenging issues in IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6 MAC Superframe structures. In the similar way, IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6 PHY layers have also unique constraints to modulate the various vital signs of patient data into continuous and discrete forms. Numerous research contributions have been made for addressing these issues of the aforementioned three layers in WBAN.

To this end, we first propose a mathematical programming formulation, based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which is designed to provide optimal solutions in case where the deployment area is represented through a set of discrete potential locations of the cameras. Due to the combinatorial nature of such problems, finding exact solutions entails a tremendous computational cost. Consequently, we introduce various suboptimal solution approaches, based on a number of well-known metaheuristics, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms. Numerical results show PSO succeeds to find the best solutions in the majority of considered scenarios. Furthermore, even for large instances, it provides better feasible solutions than those returned the MILPs after a significant amount of time.																			0926-6801	1875-8940					2017	24	1					17	30		10.3233/JHS-170578	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JHS-170578													WOS:000422861400002

PointOT: Interpretable Geometry-Inspired Point Cloud Generative Model via Optimal Transport	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY												Point cloud generative models have aroused increasing concern for their realistic generation potentialities. However, most existing methods adopt deep-neural-network (DNN) models for continuous mapping. DNN usually induces mode collapse and mixture problems without clear interpretation. Consequently, in this paper, we design a geometry-inspired point cloud generative framework called PointOT. PointOT decouples the generative model into two separate sub-tasks: manifold learning of the point cloud and distribution transformation. Then, we propose corresponding instances according to the requirements in each sub-task, where they can be established by the point cloud auto-encoder (AE) and the semi-continuous optimal transportation (SCOT) mapping, respectively. In particular, the transportation map between the source and the target distributions is discrete rather than continuous in geometric view. The learned continuous shape model of the DNN point cloud does not conform with the discrete distribution transformation. Therefore, the proposed SCOT efficiently relieves these problems by connecting the continuous-to-discrete domain. Besides, we provide theoretical explanations from a geometric view and analyze the fundamental reason for mode collapse and mixture in point cloud generative models. The proposed SCOT algorithm without the DNN model is computationally efficient and makes the original black box semi-transparent. Final experiments validate the virtue of the proposed approach, including the designed decomposition framework and the rigorous theory.																			1051-8215	1558-2205				OCT	2022	32	10					6792	6806		10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3170588	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3170588													WOS:000864197600026

Design/methodology/approach - The original N solution vectors in ACACO are sorted and categorized into three groups according to their ranks. The Research Learning scheme provides the local search capability for the best-ranked group. The Basic Learning scheme uses the ant colony optimization (ACO) technique for the worst-ranked group to approach the best solution. The operations of assimilation, accommodation, and mutation in Mutual Learning scheme are used for the middle-ranked group to exchange and accommodate the partial information between groups and, globally, search information. Only the N top-best-performance solutions are reserved after each iteration of learning. Findings - The proposed algorithm outperforms some reported ACO algorithms for the fuzzy system design with the same number of rules. The performance comparison with various previously published neural fuzzy systems also shows its superiority even with a smaller number of fuzzy rules to those neural fuzzy systems. Research limitations/implications - Future work will consider the application of the proposed ACACO to the recurrent fuzzy network. Originality/value - The originality of this work is to mix the work of the well-known psychologist Jean Piaget and the continuous ACO to propose a new population-based optimization algorithm whose superiority is demonstrated.

In the existing literature, the MESS arbitrage problems are usually cast as mixed-integer programming models. However, the performance of this model-based method is deteriorated by the uncertainties of power and transportation networks and the complicated operational characteristics of batteries. To overcome the deficiencies of existing methods, this article proposes a data-driven uncertainty-adaptive MESS arbitrage method considering MESS mobility rules, battery degradation, and operational efficiencies. A two-layer deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is developed to obtain the discrete mobility and continuous charging or discharging power, and a sequential training strategy is designed to accelerate the convergence of model training. The proposed method is tested using the real-world electricity prices and traffic information of charging stations. Compared with traditional model-based methods that rely on entire and accurate future information, the proposed DRL method obtains high arbitrage profits by learning arbitrage strategies from historical data and making effective decisions with limited real-time information.

In this paper, the proposed MJSs fuzzy model is formulated with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties and time-varying jump transition probability matrices. In particular, the time-varying transition probability matrices are expressed in respect of a polytope. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional, a new set of sufficient conditions is derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to ensure that the filtering error system is robustly stochastically finite-time bounded and a prescribed mixed H-infinity and passive performance index is achieved. Moreover, the robust mixed H-infinity and passivity filter design gain matrices can be computed from the obtained LMIs.

The controller is usually designed in continuous-mode and discretized in implementation with a large sampling period, which may result in a degraded dynamic performance or even cause system instability. On the other hand, high penetration of wind power reduces the inertia of the power system, leading to a faster frequency response and larger frequency deviation after a contingency, and desires a fast load frequency control. Therefore, this paper presents a discrete-mode load frequency control scheme considering a large sampling period of control/measurement signals via sampled-data control, and introduces an exponential decay rate as a new performance index to guide a design of load frequency control scheme with desired faster frequency response. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a one-area power system, a traditional two-area power system with wind power and a deregulated three-area power system with wind power. Using the proposed scheme and the state-of-the-art schemes, the frequency response performance and the tolerance to sampling period of power systems are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can ensure the stable operation of the system under a larger sampling period so as to reduce the communication network burden. Also, the results show that the controller designed by a large exponential decay rate can provide a fast frequency response to alleviate the impact of the system's frequency response due to the high penetration of wind power.

This paper aims at finding a response for this question to present a game-based model under a competitive market for long-term multiperiod planning of a distribution network containing several MGs, such that it can model the impact of decision making of the distribution system operator (DSO) on the MG investor and vice versa, also improve MG allocation algorithms. To achieve this, a mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel programming is employed, where in the external level, DSO's objectives and in the internal level, MGs' objectives are optimized based on the dictation by DSO. Since solving this type of problems by employing the conventional tools is almost impossible, so a mathematical method is utilized to convert this problem to a standard form.

We develop a framework to design a sparse sensor schedule for a given large-scale linear system with guaranteed performance bounds using a learning-based algorithm. To sparsify the sensors in both time and space, we build our combinatorial optimization problems based on the notion of systemic controllability/observability metrics for linear dynamical networks with three properties: monotonicity, convexity, and homogeneity with respect to the controllability/observability Gramian matrix of the network. These combinatorial optimizations are inherently intractable and NP-hard. However, solving a continuous relaxation for each optimization is considered best practice. This is achievable since we constructed the objective based on the systemic metrics, which are convex. Furthermore, by leveraging recent advances in sparsification literature and regret minimization, we then round the fractional solution obtained by the continuous optimization to achieve a (1 + epsilon) approximation sparse schedule that chooses on average a constant number of sensors at each time, to approximate all types of systemic metrics (cf. Table I).					Vafaee, Reza/A-6995-2019	Vafaee, Reza/0000-0003-0677-4755													0743-1619	2378-5861	978-1-6654-5196-3				2022							1459	1465																WOS:000865458701071

To conceptualise this rationale to sampled control systems, we deal with a discrete-time system arising from a symplectic discretization of a continuous-time linear port-Hamiltonian system, such as the implicit midpoint method. As a preliminary step, we introduce the concept of Krasovskii passivity for discrete-time systems and further show that a discretized linear port-Hamiltonian system is Krasovskii passive in the discrete-time sense. Then, based on the discrete-time version of Krasovskii passivity, we develop a sampled-data output feedback controller to achieve output consensus. The proposed sampled-data controller can be understood as a symplectic discretization of the continuous-time output consensus controller. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the main result by achieving current sharing in a DC power network. Copyright (c) 2023 The Authors.

This paper focuses mainly on dealing with the discrete-time tracking control problem of both the simple pendulum system and inverted-pendulum-on-a-cart (IPOAC) system. Based on zeroing neural dynamics (ZND), controllers of z2 type are designed respectively for the effective tracking control of the above two pendulum systems. Then, with the aim of possible digital hardware implementation, a 4-node discretization (4ND) formula, which is of square precision in terms of truncation error, is employed to discretize the continuous-time pendulum systems with high precision (i.e., with discretization error being proportional to the cube of the sampling gap). By comparing with Euler-type discretization, simulative results further substantiate the feasibility, accuracy and superiority of the discrete-time control of both the simple pendulum system and IPOAC system with the 4ND formula.

Due to the complexity of nonlinear systems, the approximately optimal control for affine uncertain continuous-time nonlinear systems is pursued. Considering that only the output variables can be measured in the control practice, the state observer is designed to reconstruct all system states by using the output variables. The observer-based policy iteration algorithm can solve the HJB equation within the adaptive dynamic programming framework for the unknown-state uncertain nonlinear systems, where a critic neural network is constructed to approximate the optimal cost function, and then, the approximate expression of the optimal control policy can be directly derived from solving the HJB equation. In addition, the stability of the whole closed-loop system is provided based on the Lyapunov analysis.

However, there are few studies looking into regressive approach. Actually, human affective states are continuous rather than discrete. This paper focuses on how to estimate continuous affective status from EEG recordings. A Shallow Fully Convolutional Network (SFCN) with Boost Training Strategy is proposed to estimate affective status, including Valence, Arousal, Dominance, and Liking. SFCN is presented to extract the emotional relative features automatically from preprocessed EEG instead of using hand-crafted features. With Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer, SFCN can solve the effect of unreliability of label introduced by segmented-augmentation method. Moreover, Boost Training Strategy is designed to train model with low memory cost and further improves the performance of SFCN. Experiments on DEAP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches. Results show that Mean Square Error (MSE) for Valence, Arousal, Dominance, Liking are 3.9181, 3.6009, 3.4441 and 4.806, respectively.																			2945-9133	1611-3349	978-3-030-39431-8; 978-3-030-39430-1				2020	11691						55	64		10.1007/978-3-030-39431-8_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-39431-8_6													WOS:000675430300006

However, the conventional fully digital precoding architectures might lead to high implementation complexity and energy consumption. In this paper, hybrid analog/digital precoding solutions are developed for the downlink operation in LEO massive MIMO satellite communications, by exploiting the slow-varying statistical channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. First, we formulate the hybrid precoder design as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by considering both the continuous and discrete phase shift networks for implementing the analog precoder. The cases of both the fully and the partially connected architectures are considered. Since the EE optimization problem is nonconvex, it is in general difficult to solve. To make the EE maximization problem tractable, we apply a closed-form tight upper bound to approximate the ergodic rate. Then, we develop an efficient algorithm to obtain the fully digital precoders. Based on which, we further develop two different efficient algorithmic solutions to compute the hybrid precoders for the fully and the partially connected architectures, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches achieve significant EE performance gains over the existing baselines, especially when the discrete phase shift network is employed for analog precoding.

Transportation-location problem with unknown number of facilities	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING												The traditional transportation-location problem seeks to determine the location of m new capacitated facilities in continuous space and the level of interaction between these new facilities and existing facilities to minimize the total fixed and variable costs. This paper studies a variant of the transportation location problem where the number of new facilities is also a decision variable. The problem has practical applications for designing large distribution networks. Several non-linear mixed integer formulations are presented in order to understand the intrinsic complexity of the problem. Given that the problem is NP hard, a decomposition heuristic (DH) and a simulated annealing-based heuristic (SA) are developed based on the mathematical structure of the problem and compared via experimentation. It is found that both heuristics find the same solution for 40 internally generated problems. Three new benchmark problems are presented and an upper bound is provided. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the nonlinear term with perturbation is put into the local nonlinear part so that the nonlinear system with perturbation can be described as an interval type-1 (IT1) T-S fuzzy system. Then, based on the unknown input observer technology, the IT1 T-S fuzzy fault estimation (FE) observer scheme is presented to obtain the real-time FE information and decouple the local nonlinear part from the estimation error system, where the design complexity and the computational burden are reduced simultaneously. Second, based on the real-time FE information, an FE-based interval type-2 (IT2) T-S fuzzy fault-tolerant control scheme is presented to achieve the compensation for the influence of the fault signal and the stabilization for the system. Different from the traditional methods, a mixed design scheme, which is based on the IT1 T-S fuzzy fault estimation observer method and the IT2 T-S fuzzy fault-tolerant controller method, is proposed in this paper. This strategy can not only reduce the computational burden, but also obtain a less conservative result. Finally, the effectiveness of the mixed design approach is illustrated by an example.

A memetic algorithm with a novel neighborhood search and modified solution representation for closed-loop supply chain network design	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING												Stringent pressures from environmental requirements have forced plants to face a commencing problem, which is to improve strategies to configure forward and reverse supply chains simultaneously. With this aim, many mathematical models and solution approaches have been developed in the literature. In this paper, to tackle such problems, a memetic algorithm (MA) with an extended priority-based (EPb) encoding/decoding method based on a flexible combinatorial neighborhood search (NS) strategy is developed. Moreover, to avoid time-consuming repair process in discrete solution representation, a technique to convert the discrete representation to a continuous one is proposed. Finally, to speed up the proposed algorithm, a multi-start simulation annealing (MSA) is embedded to the MA. To assess the quality of the novel hybrid memetic algorithm (HMA), test problems from the small size for accuracy to the real size for efficiency are presented. The results are first compared with commercial solvers and then compared with other genetic algorithms (GAs) and MAs in the literature with different solution encoding/decoding methods and operators. All algorithms are applied for a closed-loop supply chain network design (CLSCND) which deals with locating facilities as well as assigning product flows and inventory costs in a multi period environment. The results demonstrate the high quality of the proposed HMA.

Comparability of a regional and state survey: effects on fish IBI assessment for West Virginia, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Probability-based survey designs are now being investigated to allow condition to be assessed for a discrete population of watershed management units and to infer probability of impairment to other unsampled watersheds. Results can be used to focus further monitoring and restoration efforts. Fish community data and index of biotic integrity (IBI) development were compared between the 1993 and 1998 Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment (EMAP-MAIA) survey and a West Virginia Regional EMAP (WV REMAP) survey conducted in 2001-2002. Both designs were based on probability surveys, but the EMAP design treated streams as a continuous linear network comprising an infinite population of points, while the REMAP design used a discrete set of watershed outlets as defined by 12-digit Hydrologic Cataloging Units (HUC12) as the sample population. The comparability of the watershed-based WV REMAP survey design results with the linear network-based EMAP-MAIA survey results for West Virginia was affected by the different size range of watershed areas included in each target population. Once similar watershed area ranges were considered by narrowing the size range included in the West Virginia EMAP-MAIA data set, virtually identical cumulative distribution functions for fish IBI scores were obtained. The reduced variability in reference conditions obtained by applying a restricted range of watershed areas allowed us to detect and correct for ecoregional differences in fish IBI metrics and scores, after excluding the biogeographically distinct Potomac River drainage basin located in the Central Appalachian Ridge and Valley Ecoregion.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2008	603						279	300		10.1007/s10750-008-9278-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9278-3													WOS:000254088900021

The amount of earthwork operations depends on the design of the vertical alignment, so a good vertical alignment can have a profound impact on final construction costs. In this research, we improve the performance of a previous mixed-integer linear programming model, and we propose a new quasi-network flow model. Both models use a piecewise quadratic curve to compute the minimum cost vertical alignment and take earthwork operations into account. The models consider several features such as side-slopes, and physical blocks in the terrain. In addition to improving the precision, we propose several techniques that speed up the search for a solution, so that it is possible to make interactive design tools.

We formulate a joint design of remote radio head (RRH) selection, RRH-user association, and transmit beamforming for simultaneously optimizing the achievable sum rate and total power consumption, using the multiobjective optimization concept. Due to the nonconvexity of perfronthaul capacity constraints and introduced binary selection variables, the formulated problem lends itself to a mixed-integer nonconvex program, which is generally non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Motivated by powerful computing capability of C-RAN and for benchmarking purposes, we propose a branch and reduce and bound-based algorithm to attain a globally optimal solution. For more practically appealing approaches, we then propose three iterative low-complexity algorithms. In the first method, we iteratively approximate the continuous nonconvex constraints by convex conic ones using successive convex approximation framework. More explicitly, the problem obtained at each iteration is a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MI-SOCP) for which dedicated solvers are available. In the second method, we first relax the binary variables to be continuous to arrive at a sequence of SOCPs and then perform a postprocessing procedure on the relaxed variables to search for a high-performance solution. In the third method, we solve the considered problem in view of sparsity-inducing regularization. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms converge rapidly and achieve near-optimal performance as well as outperform the known algorithms.

The random packet losses are described by a Bernoulli distributed white sequence that obeys a conditional probability distribution, and the multiplicative disturbances are in the form of a scalar Gaussian white noise with unit variance. In the presence of mixed delays, random packet losses and multiplicative noises, sufficient conditions for the existence of an observer-based fuzzy feedback controller are derived, such that the closed-loop control system is asymptotically mean-square stable and preserves a guaranteed H-infinity performance.

Hydrodynamic Mixing Tunes the Stiffness of Proteoglycan-Mimicking Physical Hydrogels	ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS												Self-assembling hydrogels are promising materials for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. However, designing hydrogels that replicate the 3-4 order of magnitude variation in soft tissue mechanics remains a major challenge. Here hybrid hydrogels are investigated formed from short self-assembling beta-fibril peptides, and the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate (CS), chosen to replicate physical aspects of proteoglycans, specifically natural aggrecan, which provides structural mechanics to soft tissues. Varying the peptide:CS compositional ratio (1:2, 1:10, or 1:20) can tune the mechanics of the gel by one to two orders of magnitude. In addition, it is demonstrated that at any fixed composition, the gel shear modulus can be tuned over approximately two orders of magnitude through varying the initial vortex mixing time. This tuneability arises due to changes in the mesoscale structure of the gel network (fibril width, length, and connectivity), giving rise to both shear-thickening and shear-thinning behavior. The resulting hydrogels range in shear elastic moduli from 0.14 to 220 kPa, mimicking the mechanical variability in a range of soft tissues. The high degree of discrete tuneability of composition and mechanics in these hydrogels makes them particularly promising for matching the chemical and mechanical requirements of different applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

In the first problem, all customers need to be served by open facilities, and in the second (covering) variant a penalty is imposed for customers that cannot receive the service. Compared to the standard facility location setting, an additional constraint is imposed asking that all open facilities are interconnected, i.e., all open facilities need to be within a given radius of each other. These problems combine classical facility location aspects with network design, and we exploit this link to derive new mixed integer programming models. The strength of these models is investigated both theoretically and empirically.

J	Wu, DQ; Zhang, YN				Wu, Dongqing; Zhang, Yunong			Discrete-time ZNN-based noise-handling ten-instant algorithm solving Yang-Baxter-like matrix equation with disturbances	NEUROCOMPUTING												Time-variant Yang-Baxter-like matrix equation (YBLME) with the disturbances of noises is the hotspot in various scientific disciplines. The existing research, either can not handle the noise, or rely on the build-in numerical algorithm provided by MATLAB. Therefore, it is necessary to further study the digital-computer discrete solution of this problem. In this paper, the authors propose a noise-handling ten-instant discrete solution for the time-variant YBLME. By defining the matrix-form error function, Zhang neural network (ZNN) is exploited to design the continuous-time noise-handling ZNN model. For potential digital hardware (i.e., digital computer) realization, a discrete-time ZNN-based noise-handling ten-instant (DTZNH10i) algorithm, which is capable of handling three types of noises, is proposed on the basis of a Zhang time discretization (ZTD) formula. The convergence and precision of the proposed DTZNH10i algorithm are investigated and discussed. Theoretical analyses show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The paper offers three examples of time-variant YBLME with disturbances of constant, linear, and bounded random noises to illustrate the efficacy and convergence of the proposed algorithm.

The authors introduce scrambler networks, a feature attribution method tailor-made for discrete sequence inputs. Sequence-based neural networks can learn to make accurate predictions from large biological datasets, but model interpretation remains challenging. Many existing feature attribution methods are optimized for continuous rather than discrete input patterns and assess individual feature importance in isolation, making them ill-suited for interpreting nonlinear interactions in molecular sequences. Here, building on work in computer vision and natural language processing, we developed an approach based on deep learning-scrambler networks-wherein the most important sequence positions are identified with learned input masks. Scramblers learn to predict position-specific scoring matrices where unimportant nucleotides or residues are scrambled by raising their entropy. We apply scramblers to interpret the effects of genetic variants, uncover nonlinear interactions between cis-regulatory elements, explain binding specificity for protein-protein interactions, and identify structural determinants of de novo-designed proteins. We show that scramblers enable efficient attribution across large datasets and result in high-quality explanations, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods.																				2522-5839				JAN	2022	4	1					41	+		10.1038/s42256-021-00428-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42256-021-00428-6		JAN 2022						35966405					WOS:000746785300005
J	Xie, XH; Li, SB; Xu, BG				Xie, Xuhuan; Li, Shanbin; Xu, Bugong			Output-based event-triggered control for networked control systems: tradeoffs between resource utilisation and robustness	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												The additional threshold of a mixed event-triggering mechanism (ETM) makes it impossible to guarantee the requirement of asymptotic stability. As a consequence, it is necessary to investigate input-to-state practically stable (ISpS) which is a mild stability property. In this study, the authors firstly model the closed-loop event-triggered control system as a delayed linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems with a mixed ETM and parameter uncertainty. Then, a co-design condition in a sense of ISpS of controller gain and trigger parameters for the delayed LPV systems is obtained by employing the parameter-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and congruent transformation method. Moreover, based on the obtained co-design condition in a sense of ISpS, an optimisation algorithm for the tradeoffs between resource utilisation and robustness of the closed-loop system is further proposed. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				OCT 16	2018	12	15					2138	2147		10.1049/iet-cta.2018.5323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2018.5323													WOS:000445062500014
J	Li, ZT; Guo, YQ; Gui, WH				Li, Zhitao; Guo, Yuqian; Gui, Weihua			Asymptotical feedback controllability of continuous-time probabilistic logic control networks	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS												In this article, we study the controllability of continuous-time probabilistic logic con-trol networks (CT-PLCNs) under sampled-data feedback controls (SDFCs). First, we demonstrate that the concept of finite-time controllability with probability one for discrete-time probabilistic logic control networks cannot be generalized to CT-PLCNs. Then, we propose the concepts of asymptotical feedback reachability and asymptotical feedback controllability for CT-PLCNs. Based on the invariant subsets, we prove that a target state is asymptotically feedback reachable if and only if the target state is a control equilibrium point and any initial state has an admissible path to the target state. More-over, we introduce the concept of reachability matrix and propose an easily verifiable criterion for asymptotical feedback reachability expressed in terms of the reachability matrix. Based on these, we prove that a CT-PLCN is asymptotically feedback controllable if and only if every state is a control equilibrium point and there is an admissible path between any pair of initial and target states. The relation between controllability and stabilizability is also discussed. We prove that a CT-PLCN is asymptotically feedback controllable if and only if every state is asymptotically feedback stabilizable. For a controllable CT-PLCN, we propose an algorithm of designing a stabilizing SDFC for any given target state. Additionally, we discuss the asymptotical feedback controllability of CT-PLCNs under time-varying nonuniform SDFCs. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to explain the proposed methods and verify the controllability criteria.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper considers a general multi-hop RIS-aided multi-user communication system and the weighted sum-rate maximization problem is studied by jointly designing the active beamforming matrix at the base station and multiple phase-shift matrices at the RISs (considering both continuous and discrete phase constraints). To tackle the resulting highly nonconvex optimization problem, a problem-tailored low-complexity and globally convergent algorithm based on block minorization-maximization (BMM) is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed BMM approach and the performance improvement gained with multi-hop RISs are both demonstrated through numerical simulations. The merits of the proposed algorithms are further illustrated by indicating their adaptivity in solving many other RIS-related system designs.																			2325-3789		978-1-6654-2851-4				2020							106	110		10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593114													WOS:000783745500022

This fact results in distinct behaviours depending on the dynamic state (flow/volume) of the network. These behaviours can not be neglected nor can be modelled by a pure linear representation. In order to take into account these phenomena and elements for the design of the control strategy, a modelling approach based on piece-wise linear functions (PWLF) is proposed and compared against a hybrid modelling approach previously reported by the authors. Control performance results and associated computation times considering both modelling approaches are compared by using a real case study based on the Barcelona sewer network. Results have shown an important reduction in the computation time when the PWLF-based model is used, with an acceptable suboptimality level in the closed-loop system performance.

A hierarchical behavior prediction framework at signalized intersections	2021 IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC				IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)	SEP 19-22, 2021	Indianapolis, IN	IEEE				Road user behavior prediction is one of the most critical components in trajectory planning for autonomous driving, especially in urban scenarios involving traffic signals. In this paper, a hierarchical framework is proposed to predict vehicle behaviors at a signalized intersection, using the traffic signal information of the intersection. The framework is composed of two phases: a discrete intention prediction phase and a continuous trajectory prediction phase. In the discrete intention prediction phase, a Bayesian network is adopted to predict the vehicle's high-level intention, after that, maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning is utilized to learn the human driving model offline; during the online trajectory prediction phase, a driver characteristic is designed and updated to capture the different driving preferences between human drivers. We applied the proposed framework to one of the most challenging scenarios in autonomous driving: the yellow light running scenario. Numerical experiment results are presented in the later part of the paper which show the viability of the method. The accuracy of the Bayesian network for discrete intention prediction is 91.1%, and the prediction results are getting more and more accurate as the yellow time elapses. The average Euclidean distance error in continuous trajectory prediction is only 0.85 m in the yellow light running scenario.

Design of the Toroidal Field Coil System for the TPM-1U Tokamak	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Using infrastructure from the old TPM-1 tokamak in Mexico, there is an ongoing project to bring it back into operation, but with important upgrades. One of the main planned improvements will be the substitution of the continuous winding used to generate the toroidal field (TF) with a set of discrete circular coils. The new toroidal magnetic field configuration should also allow stable operation of the machine at plasma currents of up to 50 kA for 30 ms. At this design stage, decisions regarding number and characteristics of the coils and power delivery strategy to them need to be addressed. In the present paper, a study regarding the parameters required for the generation of the adequate TF are presented, including the process for determining number of TF coils, their size and position, the required current pulse for operation, and a potential strategy for generating such pulse based on passive pulse-forming networks.

Optimization of extended business processes in digital supply chains using mathematical programming	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												We propose a mathematical programming approach to optimize the business process transactions in dig-ital supply chains. Five scheduling models from the Process Systems Engineering (PSE) area are applied to schedule the processing of orders in a simplified Order-To-Cash (OTC) business process, which is mod-eled as a multistage network with parallel units (agents). Two case studies are presented to compare the performance of the scheduling models on various sizes of a flexible jobshop representation of the OTC process. The models are compared and scaled to select those that are more suitable to this application. The continuous-time general precedence model provides an accurate representation of the real system and performs well for small instances. The discrete-time State-Task Network (STN), however, proves most efficient in terms of tractability, despite the well-known limitations resulting from discretizing time. The tightness of the linear programming (LP) relaxations in the discrete-time STN framework, as well as the ability of commercial solvers to perform preprocessing and apply heuristics to the STN formulation, en-ables finding near optimal solutions quickly even for larger instances.

In this paper, we provide a new analysis of a TCP/AQM system that aims to improve the accuracy of the MGT fluid model especially in heavy traffic conditions. The analysis is based on the consideration of two extreme congestion scenarios that leads to the derivation of upper and lower bounds for the queue length and marking probability dynamics and showing that they approach each other in steady state.

We consider the problem of weighted sum average rate maximisation of wireless links. In an orthogonal transmission system, a link is selected using instantaneous signal-to-noise (SNR) of all the links, and its rate and power are set in a jointly optimised manner. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we analyse ISLA schemes with continuous rate adaptation using constant or adaptive transmission powers. ISLA schemes are designed in similar settings for practical discrete rate-adaptive systems using adaptive modulation and coding. To this end, a design framework is presented, which relies on a partitioning of space of links' SNRs into regions, similar to structured vector quantisation. Within this framework, a particular ISLA design with high performance and polynomial complexity is suggested. The proposed schemes are designed before the start of the transmission, based on closed-form solutions, and can easily be applied to multiple access or broadcast networks. We also analyse several schemes for comparison, which employ modified Round-Robin, opportunistic scheduling or online generalised scheduling. Numerical results demonstrate how the proposed ISLA schemes outperform the benchmark schemes and effectively meet various user requirements.(1)						taki, mehrdad/0000-0003-0063-2166; Nezafati, Mohammad B./0000-0003-4858-6031													0020-7217	1362-3060				JUL 2	2020	107	7					1098	1126		10.1080/00207217.2019.1703222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207217.2019.1703222		DEC 2019											WOS:000503901200001

It is considered that the Markov chain parameter, denoted by ?(k), is not observable but, instead, only an estimation, represented by (?) over cap (k), is available for the filter design. Sufficient synthesis conditions for the filter design, based on linear matrix inequalities, are provided. These conditions for the H-2 and H-8 filters are not conservative in the sense that, for the full-order case and perfect information of the Markov parameter, they become also necessary. Simplified conditions are derived for the Bernoulli case. This article is concluded with an illustrative example in the context of networked control systems, in which we study the effects of reducing the order of the filter on the estimation performance.					; Marcorin de Oliveira, Andre/K-3830-2018	Barros dos Santos, Sergio Ronaldo/0000-0002-2716-7455; Costa, Oswaldo/0000-0002-0875-8698; Marcorin de Oliveira, Andre/0000-0003-4351-3896													2168-2216	2168-2232				OCT	2023	53	10					6353	6364		10.1109/TSMC.2023.3283210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2023.3283210		JUN 2023											WOS:001019417500001

RCACO determines the number of fuzzy rules and optimizes all the free parameters in each fuzzy rule. It uses an online-rule-generation method to determine the number of rules and identify suitable initial parameters for the rules and then optimizes all the free parameters using continuous ant-colony optimization (ACO). In contrast to traditional ACO, which optimizes in the discrete domain, the RCACO optimizes parameters in the continuous domain and can achieve greater learning accuracy. In RCACO, the path of an ant is regarded as a combination of antecedent and consequent parameters from all the rules. A new path-selection method based on pheromone levels is proposed for initial-solution construction. The solution is modified by sampling from a Gaussian probability-density function and is then refined using the group best solution. Simulations on fuzzy control of three nonlinear plants are conducted to verify RCACO performance. Comparisons with other swarm intelligence and genetic algorithms demonstrate the advantages of RCACO.

Mobility & Routing Control in Networks of Robots	49TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control				49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 15-17, 2010	Atlanta, GA	IEEE				Most coordinated tasks performed by teams of mobile robots, require reliable communications between the members of the team. Therefore, task accomplishment requires that robots navigate their environment with their collective movement restricted to formations that guarantee integrity of the communication network. Maintaining this communication capability induces physical constraints on trajectories but also requires determination of communication variables like routes and transmitted powers. The development of theory and algorithms for joint control of mobility and communications is therefore necessary to facilitate efficient design of mobile autonomous systems. In this paper we address this challenge using a hybrid approach, where continuous motion controllers based on potential fields interact with discrete optimization of the communication variables to result is a muti-robot network that deploys itself to accomplish certain tasks, while ensuring integrity of communications. Our definition of network integrity differs from existing approaches in that it is not based on the topology of the network but on metrics that are of interest to the performance of communication between robots and possibly a fixed infrastructure. In this paper, integrity is defined as the ability of a network to support desired communication rates.

Oscillating droplet trains in microfluidic networks and their suppression in blood flow	NATURE PHYSICS												Droplets forming sequences in simple microfluidic networks are known to exhibit complex behaviours, but their dynamics are yet to be probed in channels long enough to accommodate many droplets simultaneously. Here we show that uniform sequences of liquid droplets flowing through microfluidic networks can spontaneously form 'trains' that periodically exchange between different branches of the network. Such system-wide oscillations do not rely on direct droplet-droplet interactions, are common to networks of various topologies, can be controlled or eliminated by adjusting network dimensions and can synchronize into larger flow patterns. The oscillations can also be suppressed via droplet collisions at diverging junctions. This mechanism may explain why red blood cells in microcapillaries exhibit only low-amplitude oscillations, preventing dangerous local hypertension or hypoxia that might otherwise ensue. Our findings are substantiated by a theoretical model that treats droplets as sets of moving points in one-dimensional ducts and captures the dynamics of large droplet ensembles without invoking the microscopic details of flows in or around the droplets. For blood flow, this simplified description offers more realistic estimates than continuous haemodynamic models, indicating the relevance of the discrete nature of blood to the excitation of oscillations.

We assume that the half-duplex relay is equipped with a buffer and employs in each time slot adaptive scheduling of reception and transmission based on the instantaneous qualities of the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links. Furthermore, as a practical constraint, we assume that in each time slot, the source and the relay can select transmission rates only from a discrete and finite set of available transmission rates. For this network, we design the optimal scheduling of reception and transmission at the relay and the optimal selection of the transmission rates at the source and the relay such that the throughput is maximized. Our numerical results show that the maximum throughput achieved with the proposed buffer-aided protocol for discrete transmission rates is significantly larger than the throughput achieved with conventional relaying protocols with continuous transmission rates.

Under the assumption that the activation functions are globally Lipschitz continuous, we derive a new criterion for the robust stability of a class of delayed neural networks by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theorems and the Homomorphic mapping theorem. Different from those previously published conditions in the recent literature, the robust stability result presented in this paper not only establishes a time-independent relationship between the network parameters of the neural network, but also takes into account the number the neurons of the designed neural system. Some illustrative numerical examples are also given to make a detailed comparison between our result and the previously published corresponding results. This comparison proves that our result is new and can be considered an alternative condition to those of the previously reported robust stability results. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the digital modulation still remains a challenge for neural networks. The intrinsic mechanism of neural network based digital modulation is mapping continuous output of the neural network encoder into discrete constellation symbols, which is a non-differentiable function that cannot be trained with existing gradient descend algorithms. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we develop a joint coding-modulation scheme for digital semantic communications with BPSK modulation. In our method, the neural network outputs the likelihood of each constellation point, instead of having a concrete mapping. A random code rather than a deterministic code is hence used, which preserves more information for the symbols with a close likelihood on each constellation point. The joint coding-modulation design can match the modulation process with channel states, and hence improve the performance of digital semantic communications. Experiment results show that our method outperforms existing digital modulation methods in semantic communications over a wide range of SNR, and outperforms neural network based analog modulation method in low SNR regime.																			2325-3746		978-1-6654-5085-0				2022							361	366		10.1109/WCSP55476.2022.10039447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WCSP55476.2022.10039447													WOS:000972901000067

Notably, the installation of urban transshipment points has gained increasing attention, used by logistics operators to transfer goods from large freight trucks to smaller and more agile vehicles for last-mile delivery. Nevertheless, the main challenge is how to decide the number and location of these facilities under the presence of demand uncertainty. In this paper, we develop a two-stage stochastic program to design two-echelon last-mile delivery networks under demand un-certainty. This approach decomposes the problem into strategic decisions (facility location) and operational decisions (daily distribution of goods). To address large-scale instances, we solve the model through the sample average approximation (SAA) technique and estimate the optimal routing costs (of the SAA counterpart) using a continuous approximation method. Using a real-world case study with more than 1300 customers from New York City, our results provide several managerial insights regarding the mix of transportation modes, facility location, and the impact of allowing the outsourcing of customer demand. We provide extensive validation of the two-stage stochastic program results through a simulation-based approach and the calculation of the value of the stochastic solutions.

Simultaneous re-design and scheduling of multiple effect evaporator systems	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												Evaporation is a key operation in many industries and its optimization is required for the efficient management of water and energy within the process. During the operation, dissolved solids settle on the heat exchange surfaces with the consequent increase in the heat transfer resistance. Therefore, periodic shutdowns of the trains of evaporators are required for the cleaning of the units in order to restore acceptable performance. In this work the simultaneous re-design and scheduling of multiple effect evaporation systems is addressed. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model based on a discrete time representation is proposed and applied to a typical evaporation system in the sugar industry with several multiple effect parallel lines and time decaying performance.

J	Wang, ZT; Jiang, WN; Wu, WK; Wang, SH				Wang, Zhitao; Jiang, Weinuo; Wu, Wenkai; Wang, Shihong			Reconstruction of complex network from time series data based on graph attention network and gumbel softmax	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C												It is a challenging practical problem to infer the network structure from measurable time series data. Recently, with the rapid development of graph deep learning, Zhang et al. [Appl. Netw. Sci. 4, 110 (2019)] applied graph neural network to the field of network reconstruction and proposed Gumbel Graph Network. In this paper, a graph deep learning network reconstruction method based on graph attention network and Gumbel Softmax (GAT-GS) is proposed, which can realize high accuracy network reconstruction and node state prediction of discrete and continuous systems. The GAT-GS model is designed based on the dynamic equation of nodes. It consists of two parts: a network structure learner to reconstruct a more real rather than functionally connected networks, based on Gumbel Softmax sampling to generate network structures; and a node state learner using graph attention networks to learn the state evolution of nodes, with the introduction of Laplacian matrix and adjacency matrix for better adaptation to diffusion coupling and unidirectional coupling systems. This model is trained to dynamically adjust the network adjacency matrix and attention coefficients to obtain the network structure and predict the node state. Experimental results show that the GAT-GS model has high reconstruction accuracy, strong robustness and high universality. It can be applied to various kinds of dynamic systems, including Coupled Map Lattice model and Lorenz system, can deal with time series data from regular to complete chaos, can reconstruct various kinds of complex networks, including regular network, Barabasi-Albert network and Watts-Strogatz small world network, and it can also reconstruct networks from small scale to large scale with higher computational efficiency.																			0129-1831	1793-6586				MAY	2023	34	05								10.1142/S0129183123500572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0129183123500572		OCT 2022											WOS:000873846000001
J	Azuaje, F				Azuaje, Francisco			Computational discrete models of tissue growth and regeneration	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS												Tissue growth and regeneration are fundamental processes underpinning crucial physiological and pathological conditions: ranging from normal blood vessel network development, response to stem cells therapy and cancers. Modelling of such biological phenomena has been addressed through mathematical and algorithmic approaches. The former implements continuous representations based on differential equations. The latter exploit operational descriptions in the form of computing programs to represent and execute the models. Within this area, models that define the cell as the fundamental unit of model development, as well as discrete representations of different model entities, are important to plan in vitro experiments and to generate new testable hypotheses. This article reviews the application of algorithmic discrete models, with a focus on tissue growth and regeneration phenomena in the context of health and disease. The review begins with an overview of basic concepts, problems and approaches of computational discrete models. This will include a discussion of basic assumptions and design principles. An overview of key cell-driven approaches and examples of applications in tissue growth and regeneration is provided. The specification, implementation and analysis of a model are illustrated with a hypothetical example, which mimics the branching and sprouting patterns observed in blood vessel network development. The article concludes with a discussion of current challenges and recommendations.																			1467-5463					JAN	2011	12	1					64	77		10.1093/bib/bbq017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbq017								20513669					WOS:000286991000007

Asynchronous observer-based <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> control for switched stochastic systems with mixed delays under quantization and packet dropouts	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS												In this paper, the observer-based H-infinity control problem is investigated for a class of discrete-time switched stochastic systems with mixed delays comprising both discrete and distributed delays. The measurement output of the addressed system is subject to quantizations and packet dropouts. The observer/controller switching is allowed to be asynchronous with the subsystem switching. An observer-based controller is designed such that, in the simultaneous presence of system switches, mixed delays, quantizations and packet dropouts, the closed-loop system is guaranteed to be mean-square exponentially stable while achieving the prescribed H-infinity performance constraints. Based on the piecewise Lyapunov-like functionals and the average dwell-time switching, sufficient conditions are first established under which the closed-loop system is mean-square exponentially stable with a weighted disturbance attenuation level. Then, the explicit characterizations of the observer/controller gains are obtained by means of certain nonlinear matrix inequalities that can be effectively solved by applying the cone complementary linearization algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design and characterization of superconducting nanowire-based processors for acceleration of deep neural network training	NANOTECHNOLOGY												Training of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a computationally intensive task and requires massive volumes of data transfer. Performing these operations with the conventional von Neumann architectures creates unmanageable time and power costs. Recent studies have shown that mixed-signal designs involving resistive crossbar architectures are capable of achieving acceleration factors as high as 30 000 x over the state of the art digital processors. These approaches involve utilization of non-volatile memory elements as local processors. However, no technology has been developed to-date that can satisfy the strict device requirements for the unit cell. This paper presents the superconducting nanowire-based processing element as a crosspoint device. The unit cell has many programmable non-volatile states that can be used to perform analog multiplication. Importantly, these states are intrinsically discrete due to quantization of flux, which provides symmetric switching characteristics. Operation of these devices in a crossbar is described and verified with electro-thermal circuit simulations. Finally, validation of the concept in an actual DNN training task is shown using an emulator.

Design of robust <i>H<sub>∞</sub></i> state estimator for delayed polytopic uncertain genetic regulatory networks: Dealing with finite-time boundedness	NEUROCOMPUTING												In this paper, a robust H-infinity design approach is proposed to accomplish the state estimation task for a class of continuous-time gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in the finite-time framework. For the GRNs under investigation, the distributed inter-node time delays and intra-node time delays are, respectively, taken into account in the feedback regulation function and the translation process. Moreover, the parameter uncertainty with convex polytopic constraint is introduced to characterize the unavoidable modeling errors induced by parameter sensitivity, calibration accuracy, abrupt structural changes and failures, etc. The primary objective of this paper is to design a robust state estimator for the considered GRNs based on the measured concentrations of messenger ribonucleic acid and protein such that the finite-time boundedness and the H-infinity performance are guaranteed. By resorting to the Lyapunov stability theory, the Jensen's inequality and the Gronwall inequality, some sufficient conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Subsequently, a set of parameter matrices with special structures is designed by means of the convex optimization techniques. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demon-strate the finite-time boundedness and the robust performance of the developed state estimation approach. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

J	Grot, M				Grot, Matthias			Decision support framework for tactical emergency medical service location planning	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												A well -designed emergency medical services (EMS) system is essential to provide the best possible quality of care to patients in emergencies. Exogenous effects, such as demographic change or extreme weather conditions, lead to a continuous increase in emergency calls. On the other hand, emergency vehicles and qualified personnel are limited. Consequently, there is a continuous need to improve the existing EMS systems in order to optimize the use of the available resources. To assist decision makers in this complex task, we provide a decision support framework at the tactical site planning level. First, we analyze the given historical data to find suitable periods that have similar structures in terms of the number of calls and the time of day. We follow this approach to account for fluctuating demand and time -dependent travel times. A new stochastic, time -dependent, mixed -integer extension of the maximum expected coverage location problem (MEXCLP) is developed that accounts for ambulance site interdependencies. We conduct computational experiments for an existing EMS network structure to optimally locate sites and allocate ambulances. Furthermore, we analyze the benefit of additional ambulances and flexible waiting sites. A discrete -event simulation (DES) is used to evaluate the model solutions and to provide further insights into the trade-off between quality and cost of care for the given model solutions. Results based on anonymized real -world EMS data indicate that flexible waiting sites provide considerable potential savings in the use of ambulances while maintaining a high level of coverage.

One key application of WBSN is mobile health (mllealth) for continuous patient monitoring, acquiring vital signs e.g. EEG, ECG, etc. Such monitoring devices are doomed to be portable, i.e., hatter powered, and agile to allow for patient mobility, while providing sustainable, energy-efficient hardware platforms. Hence, EEG data compression is critical in reducing the transmission power, hence increase the battery life. In this paper, we design and implement a complete hardware model based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for vital signs data compression and reconstruction on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) based platform. We evaluate the performance of our DWT compression FPGA implementation under different practical parameters including filter length and the compression ratio. We investigate the hardware and computational complexity of our design in terms of used resource blocks for future comparison with state-of-the-art techniques.

First, in order to conform to the actual kinematics model of the robot, the continuous environmental state space and discrete action state space are designed. In addition, an improved deep Q-network (DQN) method is proposed, which takes the directly collected information as the training samples and combines the environmental state characteristics of the robot and the target point to be reached as the input of the network. DQN method takes the Q value at the current position as the output of the network model and uses epsilon-greedy strategy for action selection. Finally, the reward function combined with the artificial potential field method is designed to optimize the state-action space. The reward function solves the problem of sparse reward in the environmental state space and makes the action selection of the robot more accurate. Experiments show that compared with the classical DQN method, the average loss function value is reduced by 36.87% and the average reward value is increased by 12.96%, which can effectively improve the working efficiency of mobile robot.																			2090-0147	2090-0155				APR 23	2022	2022								5433988	10.1155/2022/5433988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/5433988													WOS:001135120400001

A model-based quasi-decentralized networked control structure that enforces closed-loop stability with minimal data transfer, while simultaneously taking into account the different communication delays associated with the transfer of information between the constituent subsystems, is developed. In this structure, each control system includes: (1) a set of predictive models each of which predicts the evolution of the state variables of a given neighboring unit when measurements are unavailable and is updated when communication is restored, and (2) a set of propagation models each of which uses the delayed measurements from a given unit, together with the past values of the estimated local control action, to generate an estimate of the current state which is then used to update the state of the corresponding model. A combined discrete-continuous system formulation of the networked closed-loop plant is developed and analyzed, leading to an explicit characterization of the closed-loop stability properties in terms of the update period, the communication delay sizes, the degree of plant-model mismatch, and the selection of controller design parameters. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using a reactor-separator plant example.																			0743-1619	2378-5861	978-1-4577-1096-4; 978-1-4577-1095-7				2012							6491	6496																WOS:000310776206130

Nodes that have similar local connective patterns may share the same role. As a complementary concept of community, role can also help to recognize real-world entities. For example, it can denote identity or function in social networks. Role has been studied over the past decades, and learning role-based network representations is crucial to many downstream tasks. The important step for role-based network embedding method is extracting features to measure structural similarity instead of proximity. Although some methods have been developed to capture role features to learn structural similarities between nodes, they all design these features of fixed types, such as the global, local, and higher-order features. These features can only represent a certain type of structure, and it is very difficult to model the complex relationship between different scale features in the field of role-based network embedding. Therefore, we propose a novel role-oriented network embedding framework based on adversarial learning between higher-order and local features (ARHOL) to generate powerful role-based node representations. The higher-order features are discrete so we leverage the Auto-Encoder on them to obtain continuous representations. Then we apply the GIN on its outputs to aggregate local information. Finally, we consider the GIN as the generator and design an adversarial game between local features and GIN outputs to integrate these two aspects of features, which can enhance each other and improve the robustness. The extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our model, and prove the effectiveness of integrating higher-order and local features.																					978-1-4503-8446-9				2021							3632	3636		10.1145/3459637.3482051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3459637.3482051													WOS:001054156203134

In a decentralized setting, for PPDS, federated generative models with differential privacy are used by the existing methods. Unfortunately, the existing models apply only to images or text data and not to tabular data. Unlike images, tabular data usually consist of mixed data types (discrete and continuous attributes) and real-world datasets with highly imbalanced data distributions. Existing methods hardly model such scenarios due to the multimodal distributions in the decentralized continuous columns and highly imbalanced categorical attributes of the clients. To solve these problems, we propose a federated generative model for decentralized tabular data synthesis (HT-Fed-GAN). There are three important parts of HT-Fed-GAN: the federated variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (Fed-VB-GMM), which is designed to solve the problem of multimodal distributions; federated conditional one-hot encoding with conditional sampling for global categorical attribute representation and rebalancing; and a privacy consumption-based federated conditional GAN for privacy-preserving decentralized data modeling. The experimental results on five real-world datasets show that HT-Fed-GAN obtains the best trade-off between the data utility and privacy level. For the data utility, the tables generated by HT-Fed-GAN are the most statistically similar to the original tables and the evaluation scores show that HT-Fed-GAN outperforms the state-of-the-art model in terms of machine learning tasks.					li, xiaomin/KCX-9845-2024; Yu, Yue/JWP-9103-2024; Ma, Mingyang/JXM-3330-2024; liu, xingwang/KCY-1277-2024; Liu, Yuxuan/JVO-7759-2024; Xiaopeng, Jin/P-5162-2017	Xiaopeng, Jin/0000-0002-0058-8364; Zhang, Xinyi/0000-0002-7144-5037														1099-4300				JAN	2023	25	1							88	10.3390/e25010088	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e25010088								36673229					WOS:000915269200001

ROUs with Bernoulli distributed white noise sequences are firstly considered for tackling state estimation of SNNs, which are mutually uncorrelated stochastic variables. In order to take full advantage of the slope information about activation function (SIAAF), the estimation error of activation function is separated into two parts. Based on the more SIAAF, a modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed. In addition, by combining integral inequality and zero equality with several parameters, further improved results are emerged to ensure the error system is globally asymptotically stable with a prescribed level y and reduce conservativeness to some extent. Furthermore, the more practical non-fragile estimator gain matrix can be obtained via the above designed optimization algorithm. Finally, two numerical examples are furnished to verify the effectiveness and performance of the developed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Heterogeneous impulsive effect is a unified framework of nonidentical and time-varying impulses, i.e., the impulsive effect to state of each neuron is not only non-identical to each other but also distinct at different impulsive times. Here heterogeneous impulsive control is designed, which is an extension of hybrid impulsive control. The problem is studied with the following procedures. Firstly, the master-slave CVNNs are explicitly separated into two real-valued neural networks (RVNNs). Secondly, the two RVNNs are transformed into impulsive error dynamical system using the heterogeneous impulsive controller. Thirdly, the concepts of average impulsive interval (All) and average impulsive gain (AIG) are implemented to obtain the synchronization of delayed CVNNs under heterogeneous impulsive effects. By employing a matrix measure method and extended impulsive Halanay inequality, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee exponential synchronization of the given delayed CVNNs. The dependency of convergence rates on Alls and AlGs is explicitly discussed. Finally, two examples are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed theoretical results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of Networked Structural Control With Packet Loss	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY												This brief considers the analysis of networked structural control systems with measurement loss. This is modeled as a sampled-data system that integrates the discrete-time operation of the controller with a fast-sampling approximation of the continuous-time structural (plant) dynamics. Random measurement loss in each channel due to the use of the wireless transmission is modeled as a Bernoulli process. This leads to a discrete-time, Markov jump linear model for the feedback system. An H-2-norm analysis is proposed to assess the stability and the performance of the structural control. An example of a three-story building model is used to illustrate this approach. The H-2-norm results are shown to be in agreement with the numerical simulations. The analysis can, thus, be used to assess various design choices. For example, the relationship between the probability of signal loss and the H-2-norm depends on the method used to handle the signal loss. Moreover, the analysis shows that, for a jump controller setup using steady-state Kalman gains, the system can become unstable at very small probabilities of signal loss.

However, there is an increasing demand for fast and efficient processing systems that can handle large streams of data while decreasing system footprints. Neuromorphic computing answers this need by creating decentralized architectures that communicate with binary events over time. Despite its rapid growth in the last few years, novel algorithms are needed that can leverage the potential of this emerging computing paradigm and can stimulate the design of advanced neuromorphic chips. In this work, we propose a time-based spiking neural network that is mathematically equivalent to the Fourier transform. We implemented the network in the neuromorphic chip Loihi and conducted experiments on five different real scenarios with an automotive frequency modulated continuous wave radar. Experimental results validate the algorithm, and we hope they prompt the design of ad hoc neuromorphic chips that can improve the efficiency of state-of-the-art digital signal processors and encourage research on neuromorphic computing for signal processing.

J	Kim, C; Lee, J; Yoo, J				Kim, Cheolwoong; Lee, Jaewook; Yoo, Jeonghoon			Machine learning-combined topology optimization for functionary graded composite structure design	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING												This study presents new framework in which the representative volume element (RVE) method and machine learning (ML) model are used to construct continuous anisotropic effective material properties for simultaneous design of the overall topology configuration and local fiber material layout in functionally graded composite structures. It is an alternative to the asymptotic homogenization design method (AHDM) to obtain continuous effective material property functions. While the AHDM uses the asymptotic homogenization theory (AHT) and Legendre polynomials, the RVE method calculates anisotropic effective material properties having nonlinear behavior with respect to design variables of microstructures, and it is easier to implement than AHT given the governing equations and appropriate boundary conditions. More efficient and accurate than Legendre polynomials, ML is used to build a continuous model of the RVE results required for simultaneous design of the overall topology configuration and local fiber material layout. To show the convenience and expandability of the proposed method, a 3D RVE model is also proposed through the extension of the 2D model. The proposed method is verified through 2D and 3D numerical examples to minimize structural compliance and obtained results are compared with those from the application of AHDM.

However, the research on dynamic surface control technology in solar tracking systems in nonlinear control systems is mostly based on continuous-time systems, while adaptive dynamic surface control based on discrete-time nonlinear control systems can describe an actual control system more accurately in the production process. It can effectively suppress interference with extremely high stability and safety. To solve the problem of low efficiency in photovoltaic power generation, this research first built a photovoltaic power generation servo system model based on the parameter of uncertainty. Then, a discrete adaptive neural network dynamic surface (DANNDS) controller was designed to solve the problems in the design of the traditional backstepping method. Finally, based on the designed method of a dynamic surface controller, a discrete adaptive neural network quantization controller (DANNQC) for the photovoltaic power generation servo system was designed by introducing external disturbance. The control parameters and their studied ranges were as follows: The reference signals were or1=sin(0.1t) and or2=cos(0.1t). The parameters of the virtual control law and the final control law were m11=0.01, m22=0.01, m12=0.02, m13=0.02, and m23=0.02. The time constant of the low-pass filter was ?12=?13=?22=?23=0.005. The parameters of the parameter regulation law were ?12=?13=?22=?23=0.0005 and a12=a13=20, a22=a23=22. The research results show that the MTE, RMSTE, and 2NTE scores of the height angle servo motor of the DANNDS control method were 0.0026, 7.0279 x 10(-4), and 0.3552, respectively. The scores for each index of the azimuth servo motor were 0.0028, 8.9237 x 10(-4), and 0.4511, respectively. The height angle tracking error for the DANNQC control method was [-0.02,0.022]. The azimuth tracking error was [-0.03,0.03]. In summary, the photovoltaic power generation servo system based on the DANNQC has a better control performance. By controlling the height angle and azimuth angles, it can better track the position of the sun and adjust the position of the photovoltaic panel in real time. The sun's rays illuminate the photovoltaic panel at an appropriate angle to achieve maximum power generation efficiency, which is of great practical significance for the development of solar technology.																				2227-9717				JUN	2023	11	6							1667	10.3390/pr11061667	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr11061667													WOS:001021103300001

Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach was adopted. First, a participation-observation netnographic approach was employed to identify the interactions that lead to the collective creation of three types of value: social, intellectual, and cultural. Second, using social network analysis, the collective value creation process was examined through the network structures, and the key actors and their roles in value creation were identified. Findings findings presented that members collectively create value in a unique manner for enhancing product designs in a crowdsourcing community. Three types of value coexisted and were often created inter-dependently. The interactions among the members were not dense yet were fairly knitted without any significant core-periphery structures, indicating a less restrained flow of value. The findings of the study identified that most of the bridging members in the network were likely to have diverse social and intellectual resources. Originality/value The present study was one of the first to examine the collective value creation process through a network perspective. In particular, this study offered a richer understanding of the unique collective value creation process in a crowdsourcing community and the role of bridging actors in the network. Implications for crowdsourcing companies are provided to sustain a continuous flow of quality contributions from the forum community members.

Adaptive traffic signal control as the principle part of intelligent transportation systems has a primary role to effectively reduce traffic congestion by making a real-time adaptation in response to the changing traffic network dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective approach in machine learning that has been applied for designing adaptive traffic signal controllers.,One of the most efficient and robust type of RL algorithms are continuous state actor-critic algorithms that have the advantage of fast learning and the ability to generalize to new and unseen traffic conditions. These algorithms are utilized in this paper to design adaptive traffic signal controllers called actor-critic adaptive traffic signal controllers (A-CATs controllers). The contribution of the present work rests on the integration of three threads: (a) showing performance comparisons of both discrete and continuous A-CATs controllers in a traffic network with recurring congestion (24-h traffic demand) in the upper downtown core of Tehran city, (b) analyzing the effects of different traffic disruptions including opportunistic pedestrians crossing, parking lane, non-recurring congestion, and different levels of sensor noise on the performance of A-CATS controllers, and (c) comparing the performance of different function approximators (tile coding and radial basis function) on the learning of A-CATs controllers. To this end, first an agent-based traffic simulation of the study area is carried out. Then six different scenarios are conducted to find the best A-CATs controller that is robust enough against different traffic disruptions. We observe that the A-CRTs controller based on radial basis function networks (RBE (5)) outperforms others. This controller is benchmarked against controllers of discrete state Q-learning, Bayesian Q-learning, fixed time and actuated controllers; and the results reveal that it consistently outperforms them.

However, the flexible interconnection form that uses back-to-back power electronic converters to replace tie switches has disadvantages such as high cost and large footprint, so its mass promotion and application are bound to be limited. Therefore, a new topology of flexible interconnected distribution network with embedded DC system (FDN+EDC) with a better economy is proposed. Firstly, the topology of FDN+EDC is introduced to improve the controllability level of the distribution network under high percentage DG penetration, and is compared with the conventional flexible interconnection method. Secondly, in order to realize the coordinated optimal economic operation of source, network and load in the FDN+EDC, a dynamic reconfiguration model of switches status and continuous adjustment of flexible interconnection device (FID) are proposed. Then, to achieve a fast and globally optimal solution of the model, a hierarchical coordinated optimization strategy is designed based on an improved particle swarm algorithm for the optimization of discrete and continuous variables. Finally, the validity of the algorithm is verified, and an 88-node FDN+EDC is constructed to verify the advantages of the proposed embedded DC flexible interconnection topology and realize the joint optimal dispatch of network-source-load.

However, conventional manufacturing techniques face critical challenges in producing arbitrary geometries with programmable features, continuous interior networks, and multimaterials homogeneity. Here we propose a generalized three-dimensional (3D) printing methodology for graphene aerogels and graphene-based mixed-dimensional (2D + nD, where n is 0, 1, or 2) hybrid aerogels with complex architectures, by the development of hybrid inks and printing schemes to enable mix-dimensional hybrids printability, overcoming the limitations of multicomponents inhomogeneity and harsh post-treatments for additives removal. Importantly, nonplanar designed geometries are also demonstrated by shape-conformable printing on curved surfaces. We further demonstrate the 3D-printed hybrid aerogels as ultrathick electrodes in a symmetric compression tolerant microsupercapacitor, exhibiting quasi-proportionally enhanced areal capacitances at high levels of mass loading. The excellent performance is attributed to the sufficient ion- and electron-transport paths provided by the 3D-printed highly interconnected networks. The encouraging finding indicates tremendous potentials for practical energy storage applications. As a proof of concept, this general strategy provides avenues for various next-generation complex-shaped hybrid architectures from microscale to macroscale, for example, seawater desalination devices, electromagnetic shielding systems, and so forth.

It is formulated as a sequential coding optimization problem. The goal is to find a deterministic but adaptive policy, as a series of mappings from the historical information to the quantization strategy. In particular, an optimization problem is formulated, and then solved by the Bellman equation in dynamic programming (DP). To overcome the challenge of continuous state space, a practical solution is proposed by leveraging the approximate DP (ADP). The performance of the proposed strategy is examined for both scalar and vector dynamical systems in two practical applications.

J	Liu, HY; Xie, C				Liu, Haiyang; Xie, Chi			Allocating exclusive and intermittent transit lanes in dynamic traffic networks with connected and automated vehicles *,**	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Exclusive bus lanes (XBLs) have been widely discussed and implemented worldwide in recent years. An improved and more flexible transit lane management strategy-intermittent bus lanes (IBLs)-prove to be potentially more efficient and car-friendly than XBLs. The common benefit of XBLs and IBLs arises from the fact that they separate the bus and car traffic and hence eliminate the impacts of slowly moving buses on the car traffic. Compared to XBLs, the application of IBLs has not been broadly adopted in the real world so far except very few cases, because managing an urban IBL segment or area typically involves extra traffic signals and message signs and the switch between its regular and protected statuses could potentially cause unexpected traffic chaos and safety issues. The recent emergence of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies, however, favors relieving these concerns and bring the dawn to a future application of this theoretically sound traffic control strategy. This paper is dedicated to evaluating the network performance of XBLs and IBLs and optimizing the networkwide configurations of these two strategies for future urban traffic networks where CAVs prevail. For this purpose, we formulate a system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) problem with carexclusive lane segments, on the basis of a cell transmission model for separate car and bus traffic (CTM-SCB). By limiting its applicable context to morning commute networks and emergency evacuation networks, this model is set with only one real or virtual destination, which greatly eases its modeling and solution complexity. On the basis of the single-destination SO-DTA model, an XBL-based network design problem and an IBLbased network design problem are then both formulated into mixed integer programming models and solved by a discrete optimization solver, where the former problem statically configures bus lanes while the later one allows a dynamic allocation of bus lanes.

J	Li, L; Li, XP				Li, Li; Li, Xiaopeng			Parsimonious trajectory design of connected automated traffic	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												One challenging problem about connected automated vehicles is to optimize vehicle trajectories considering realistic constraints (e.g. vehicle kinematic limits and collision avoidance) and objectives (e.g., travel time, fuel consumption). With respect to communication cost and implementation difficulty, parsimonious trajectory planning has attracted continuous interests. In this paper, we first analyze the feasibility conditions for a general continuous-time trajectory planning problem and then propose an analytical solution method for two important boundary trajectory problems. We further propose a discrete time model with a more general objective function and a certain sparsity requirement that helps parsimonious planned trajectories. This sparsity requirement is implemented with a norm regulatory term appended to the objective function. Numerical examples are conducted on several representative applications and show that the proposed design strategy is effective. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a optimal operation model with multi-objective mixed discrete variables is established for large-scale water supply systems of some city, and the model is solved by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Simulation results of the water supply network are compared with those given by using Genetic Algorithms (GA) to solve the same problem under the same conditions, showing better performance. PSO is shown to be a promising method to solve optimal design problems regarding, in particular, water supply systems, according to the results herein obtained.																					978-0-7695-3865-5				2009							509	512		10.1109/ISCID.2009.273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISCID.2009.273													WOS:000276213800125
J	Steefel, CI; Hu, MS				Steefel, Carl, I; Hu, Mengsu			Reactive Transport Modeling of Mineral Precipitation and Carbon Trapping in Discrete Fracture Networks	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In this study we use numerical experiments to analyze reactive flow and transport behavior in discrete intersecting fracture networks, focusing on (a) how reaction-induced changes in physical and chemical properties affect flow connectivity and (b) how fracture networks developed in the Earth's critical zone contribute to carbon sequestration via mineral weathering reactions. In the first part of the study, we used two-dimensional reactive flow and transport simulations to analyze the impacts of mixing in a natural discrete fracture network. We concluded that reaction-induced changes can substantially alter the flow connectivity, especially at fracture intersections. The second set of simulations considered the problem of natural weathering of fractured mafic and ultramafic rocks in the partially saturated Earth's critical zone as a function of infiltration rates, fracture permeability, and partially saturated flow parameters. As a model system, we considered an incongruent reaction network with dissolution of forsterite and precipitation of magnesite. The behavior is complex in terms of the rate-controlling processes because of the multicomponent nature of the system as shown by the grid Peclet number: the CO2 behavior is gas diffusion-controlled in the partially saturated zone, while the rate of water flow via the Damkohler number controls Mg2+ transport through the fracture network. The amounts of carbon that can be trapped are modest, but the naturally fractured domain considered here provides a useful "base case" against which various engineered solutions can be compared. Plain Language Summary In this study we use numerical experiments to analyze reactive flow and transport behavior in discrete intersecting fracture networks, focusing on (a) how the interplay between intersections of rough fractures and advection, diffusion, and chemical reaction affects flow connectivity via changes in geometry and physical and chemical properties and (b) how fracture networks developed in the Earth's critical zone contribute to carbon sequestration via mineral weathering reactions.

J	Bagchi, S				Bagchi, Susmit			Construction and Simulation of Composite Measures and Condensation Model for Designing Probabilistic Computational Applications	SYMMETRY-BASEL												The probabilistic algorithms are widely applied in designing computational applications such as distributed systems and probabilistic databases, to determine distributed consensus in the presence of random failures of nodes or networks. In distributed computing, symmetry breaking is performed by employing probabilistic algorithms. In general, probabilistic symmetry breaking without any bias is preferred. Thus, the designing of randomized and probabilistic algorithms requires modeling of associated probability spaces to generate control-inputs. It is required that discrete measures in such spaces are computable and tractable in nature. This paper proposes the construction of composite discrete measures in real as well as complex metric spaces. The measures are constructed on different varieties of continuous smooth curves having distinctive non-linear profiles. The compositions of discrete measures consider arbitrary functions within metric spaces. The measures are constructed on 1-D interval and 2-D surfaces and, the corresponding probability metric product is defined. The associated sigma algebraic properties are formulated. The condensation measure of the uniform contraction map is constructed as axioms. The computational evaluations of the proposed composite set of measures are presented.

For the efficiency of energy, we make the first attempt to devise a switching event-triggered mechanism (ETM) which is characterized by a switching between the discrete-time sampled-data control and the common continuous ETM. In this sense, the event detector has a waiting time interval after sending a sampling signal. This method facilitates to enlarge the lower bound of inter-execution intervals so that the number of samplings can be reduced essentially. The issue of actuator saturation is also considered in this paper. By generalized sector condition, a switching Lyapunov functional is constructed to derive the sufficient conditions such that the discrete-time linear systems are local stable. Based on the stability conditions, the calculation methods are provided to solve both the desired control gains and the triggering parameters. Finally, numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the proposed design mechanism, we will take advantage of hyperbolic tangent functions to smooth the sharp corners of the input saturations and use Young's inequality to handle the nonlinear terms derived from the deducing process, and meanwhile apply the intelligent algorithm to estimate the unknown nonlinearity via neural networks. Furthermore, the backstepping technique is used to complete the design of the controller and Lyapunov stability theory is employed to show that the whole closed-loop system is semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error is bounded subject to the small neighborhood of the origin.

Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths. However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder, i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed. Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5 real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.																					978-1-4503-9096-5				2022							3102	3112		10.1145/3485447.3512030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3485447.3512030													WOS:000852713003018

The integration is challenging because continuous, Newtonian time of the physical part needs be reconciled with discrete time of the cyber part. In this work, the event-based asynchronous actors of Theatre extended with continuous modes, are used for modelling and analyzing CPSs. Continuous modes capture the dynamic laws (ODEs) of variation of physical/environmental variables. Theatre is control-based and distributed. It is implemented in Java, which is used both as the modelling language and as the target implementation language. Specific control forms were developed for simulating a distributed CPS and for assessing its functional/temporal behavior. Continuous modes exploit suitable ODE solvers to predict the future values of selected variables at specific time points. Although classical actors depend on non-deterministic message passing, a Theatre model can be designed to have a deterministic behavior. A hybrid Theatre model can be analyzed by exhaustive model checking by having, for instance, that the computations of the ODE solvers are, preliminarily, offline collected and reused during verification. This paper describes Theatre, summarizes its operational semantics and illustrates a model reduction onto Uppaal timed automata. Then an automotive deterministic model based on both wired and Controller Area Network transmitted messages is presented and thoroughly analysed.																			1550-6525		978-1-7281-7343-6				2020							107	114		10.1109/ds-rt50469.2020.9213705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ds-rt50469.2020.9213705													WOS:000628982300015

The proposed Petri net machine represents an extension of the standard discrete-event Petri nets, but differs conceptually from the conventional hybrid Petri nets in that dynamical processes are stored in the continuous places, similarly as in hybrid automata. In particular, the firing semantics of the corresponding continuous arcs is defined to capture the information exchange between the network nodes. While being primarily a graphical modeling tool, the proposed formalism of hybrid Petri nets infers a hybrid dynamical setting of event-triggered control problems, an approach that has been missing in the literature. The usability of our approach is illustrated in the context of the distributed event-triggered LQR and consensus problems, in conjunction with a systematic methodology for designing optimal adaptive scheduling schemes, governing the communication resources.

J	Abass, M; Majozi, T				Abass, Musah; Majozi, Thokozani			Optimization of Integrated Water and Multiregenerator Membrane Systems	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												Water and energy are key resources in the process industry. The increasing pressure on freshwater and energy resources coupled with stringent environmental regulations on effluent discharge limits have called for innovative designs for sustainable use of water and energy. This can be achieved through process integration techniques that are environmentally benign and economically feasible. This work proposes a robust water network superstructure optimization approach for the synthesis of a multiregenerator network for simultaneous water and energy minimization. Two types of membrane regenerators are considered for this work, namely, electrodialysis and reverse osmosis. In each of the membrane regenerators, a detailed design model is developed and incorporated into the water network model. The detailed model presented in this work is compared to the more common "blackbox" model, which uses linear expressions to represent costs of regeneration units. The results show that the "blackbox" model gives inaccurate cost representation as compared to the detailed model and also the blackbox model framework does not give insights on optimal design of the regeneration units for minimum energy usage. The presence of continuous and integer variables, as well as nonlinear constraints renders the problem mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). The developed model is applied to a pulp and paper case study to demonstrate its applicability, assuming a single contaminant scenario. The model was solved in GAMS using a solver BARON, and the results indicate a 43.7% freshwater reduction, 50.9% decrease in wastewater generation, and 46% savings in total annualized cost.

Design alternatives are generated on the basis of a state space composite model, accounting for fluid mixing, heat transfer, multiple and distributed feeds, initiator efficiency and others. A free radical polymerization kinetic mechanism is superimposed into the framework to describe the molecular and morphological polymer properties. The complexity of the kinetic mechanism due to the associated infinite dimensional population balance model (large stiff system of ODEs) is reduced by applying a continues variable approximation scheme over the discrete chain length domain. Finally an optimization problem is formulated by discretizing the resulting differential algebraic equation (DAE) system into an NLP model by applying a complete parametrization (CP) technique. Optimal reactor designs and operating modes are identified that minimize an objective function subject to technical and product quality constraints.

J	Tolson, BA; Asadzadeh, M; Maier, HR; Zecchin, A				Tolson, Bryan A.; Asadzadeh, Masoud; Maier, Holger R.; Zecchin, Aaron			Hybrid discrete dynamically dimensioned search (HD-DDS) algorithm for water distribution system design optimization	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The dynamically dimensioned search (DDS) continuous global optimization algorithm by Tolson and Shoemaker (2007) is modified to solve discrete, single-objective, constrained water distribution system (WDS) design problems. The new global optimization algorithm for WDS optimization is called hybrid discrete dynamically dimensioned search (HD-DDS) and combines two local search heuristics with a discrete DDS search strategy adapted from the continuous DDS algorithm. The main advantage of the HD-DDS algorithm compared with other heuristic global optimization algorithms, such as genetic and ant colony algorithms, is that its searching capability (i.e., the ability to find near globally optimal solutions) is as good, if not better, while being significantly more computationally efficient. The algorithm's computational efficiency is due to a number of factors, including the fact that it is not a population-based algorithm and only requires computationally expensive hydraulic simulations to be conducted for a fraction of the solutions evaluated. This paper introduces and evaluates the algorithm by comparing its performance with that of three other algorithms (specific versions of the genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization, and particle swarm optimization) on four WDS case studies (21- to 454-dimensional optimization problems) on which these algorithms have been found to perform well. The results obtained indicate that the HD-DDS algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art existing algorithms in terms of searching ability and computational efficiency. In addition, the algorithm is easier to use, as it does not require any parameter tuning and automatically adjusts its search to find good solutions given the available computational budget.

Unactuated pendulum on an actuated cart is a classic example used for designing and testing control algorithms for underactuated systems. While pendulum balancing on a horizontally moving cart is popular and environments available for reinforcement learning, pendulum on vertically moving cart is rarely discussed due to relatively higher difficulty level in balancing it. This paper presents a model environment for a pendulum on a vertically moving cart and trains a neural network controller using reinforcement learning to balance it in vertical position indefinitely without exceeding the displacement limits. Results presented for both continuous and discrete force control input for the cart system show that the neural network controllers can successfully swing up and balance the pendulum.

To address such a challenging problem, we first study the special single-user scenario and propose an algorithm that can transform the optimization problem into a semidefinite program (SDP) or an integer linear program for the cases of continuous or discrete phase shifts, respectively. Then, in order to solve the optimization problem for the multiuser scenario with continuous phase shifts, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm, which can alternately transform the problem into a second-order-cone program and an SDP. Finally, for the multiuser scenario with discrete phase shifts, we design a zero-forcing-based successive refinement algorithm, which can find the suboptimal transmit beamforming and phase shifts by means of alternating optimization. Numerical results show that compared with the benchmark schemes of random phase shifts and without using the RIS, the proposed algorithms can significantly increase the minimum achievable rate. It is also demonstrated that, compared with the case of programming continuous phase shifts, using 2-bit discrete phase shifts can practically achieve the same performance.

At each time, the demand is unknown but each of its components is assumed to belong to an assigned interval. Furthermore, the system has production and transportation capacity constraints. We face the problem of finding a control strategy that keeps the storage levels bounded. We also deal with the case in which storage level bounds are assigned and the controller must keep the state within these bounds. Both discrete and continuous time models are considered. We provide basic necessary and sufficient conditions fur the existence of such strategies. We propose several possible feedback control laws which are robust with respect to link failures and/or network parameter variations. We finally consider the case of processing/transportation delays.

A dynamic-relaxation formulation for analysis of cable structures with sliding-induced friction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES												In many cable structures, special types of joints are designed to allow cables to slide freely along the joints. Thus, a number of discrete cable elements are substituted by a single continuous cable that slides over multiple nodes. Continuous cables are employed in engineering applications such as cranes, domes, tensioned membranes and tensegrity structures. Most studies involve the assumption of friction-less movement of cable elements through pulleys. Nevertheless, frictionless sliding is usually an unrealistic hypothesis. In this paper, the dynamic relaxation (DR) method is extended to accommodate friction effects in tensioned structures that include continuous cables. The applicability of this DR formulation is demonstrated through analysis of three case studies that involve both numerical and experimental investigation. Results show potential to efficiently accommodate sliding-induced friction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on a newly developed parameter-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with Projection Lemma and an improved free-weighting matrix technique for delay-dependent criteria, a new sufficient condition for robust H-infinity performance analysis is first derived and then the filter synthesis is developed by using a simple matrix inequality linearization technique. It is shown that the desired filters can be constructed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed method in comparison with the existing approaches.

In this context, municipalities and logistics service providers aim towards sustainable and profitable city logistics, which are often conflicting goals. Whether to use single-echelon or two -echelon systems with micro-depots and city freighters as well as quantifying the benefits of shipment consolidation between independent providers under different system designs are unanswered questions in academia and practice.We provide a general methodological framework based on continuous approximation theory to study the design of city logistics networks with multiple logistics service providers that choose transportation strategies, each defined by a network structure and specific transportation modes. We provide analytical results on the comparison of different transportation strategies. By providing thresholds on the benefit of consolidated systems, we analytically quantify shipment consolidation effects in city centers. We then embed this continuous approximation into a mixed-integer non-linear program and study parameter sen-sitivities for a real-world case study.Our results show that higher customer density and longer distances between depots and distribution areas promote 2-tier transportation strategies. Consolidation between logistics service providers allows for emission reductions independent of the transportation strategy and correlate with cost reductions up to 50% on the lower echelon. Outsourcing promotes 2-tier last-mile deliveries with city freighters and in a city with heterogeneous districts, it is beneficial to use a hybrid network that includes both single-and two-echelon strategies using multiple transportation modes for different demand classes.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Integrated process design, scheduling, and control using multiparametric programming	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												A unified theory and framework for the integration of process design, control, and scheduling based on a single high fidelity model is presented. The framework features (i) a mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) formulation with design, scheduling, and control considerations, and (ii) a multiparametric optimization strategy for the derivation of offline/explicit maps of optimal receding horizon policies. Explicit model predictive control schemes are developed as a function of design and scheduling decisions, and similarly design dependent scheduling policies are derived accounting for the closed-loop dynamics. Inherent multi-scale gap issues are addressed by an offline design dependent surrogate model.

These continuous-deterministic modeling formalisms, traditionally developed and used by chemical engineers can be distinctly false if the number of molecules of reacting chemical species is very small, or if reaction events are very rare. Then stochastic-discrete representations are appropriate. Importantly, in cases where in a network of reactions there are some parts that must be modeled discretely and stochastically, yet others can be modeled continuously and deterministically, the need for development of multiscale models emerges naturally. In computational synthetic biology, such cases arise often. In this work we present the development of multiscale models for synthetic biology applications, demonstrating accuracy, computational efficiency and utility.

J	Gauthier, B; Parent, V; Lageix, P				Gauthier, Bruno; Parent, Veronique; Lageix, Philippe			Exploring the dynamics of design fluency in children with and without ADHD using artificial neural networks	CHILD NEUROPSYCHOLOGY												The neuropsychology of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been extensively studied, with a general focus on global performance measures of executive function. In this study, we compared how global (i.e., endpoint) versus process (i.e., dynamic) measures of performance may help characterize children with and without ADHD using a design fluency task as a case study. The secondary goal was to compare the sensitivity of standard versus connectionist statistical models to group differences in cognitive data. Thirty-four children diagnosed with ADHD and 37 children without ADHD aged 8-11years old were tested on the Five-Point Test. The continuous process measure of performance, indexed as the number of produced designs at each consecutive 1 minute interval during 5 minutes, was analyzed against the discrete process measure, that is, the number of designs between first and last intervals and the standard global performance measure of total number of produced designs. Results show that the continuous process measure distinguished the two groups better than the two other measures. The detailed observation of production patterns revealed a decreasing linear trajectory in children without ADHD that contrasts with the flat, but fluctuating productivity pattern of children with ADHD. With regards to the second goal, results show that the connectionist and standard methods are equally sensitive to group differences for the three types of measures. This illustrates the utility of quantitative process measures together with the connectionist method in neuropsychological research and suggests great potential for a dynamical approach to cognition.

Results from the screening site characterization then can be used to design and install a cost-effective monitoring well network. At a site in northern California, it was necessary to characterize the stratigraphy and the distribution of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to a depth of 80 feet within a 1/2-mile-by-1/4-mile residential and commercial area in a complex alluvial fan setting. To expedite characterization, a five-week field screening program was implemented that consisted of a shallow groundwater survey, CPT soundings and pore-pressure measurements, and discrete-depth groundwater sampling. Based on continuous lithologic information provided by the CPT soundings, four predominantly coarse-grained, water-yielding stratigraphic packages were identified. Individual coarse-grained units within each package are discontinuous, as they coalesce and pinch out in longitudinal and transverse directions. Seventy-nine discrete-depth groundwater samples were collected using either shallow groundwater survey techniques, the BAT Enviroprobe, or the QED HydroPunch I, depending on subsurface conditions. Using results from these efforts, a 20-well monitoring network was designed and installed to monitor critical points within each stratigraphic package. Good correlation was found for hydraulic head and chemical results between discrete-depth screening data and monitoring well data. Understanding the vertical VOC distribution and concentrations produced substantial time and cost savings by minimizing the number of permanent monitoring wells and reducing the number of costly conductor casings that had to be installed. Additionally, significant long-term cost savings will result from reduced sampling costs, because fewer wells comprise the monitoring network. We estimate these savings to be 50 percent for site characterization costs, 65 percent for site characterization time, and 60 percent for long-term monitoring costs.																									1998							43	51																WOS:000078503000005

A DISCRETE MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO SIMULATE MALWARE SPREADING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C												With the advent and worldwide development of Internet, the study and control of malware spreading has become very important. In this sense, some mathematical models to simulate malware propagation have been proposed in the scientific literature, and usually they are based on differential equations exploiting the similarities with mathematical epidemiology. The great majority of these models study the behavior of a particular type of malware called computer worms; indeed, to the best of our knowledge, no model has been proposed to simulate the spreading of a computer virus (the traditional type of malware which differs from computer worms in several aspects). In this sense, the purpose of this work is to introduce a new mathematical model not based on continuous mathematics tools but on discrete ones, to analyze and study the epidemic behavior of computer virus. Specifically, cellular automata are used in order to design such model.					del Rey, Angel Martin/ABI-7253-2020; Rodriguez, Gerardo/K-2172-2014; Martin del Rey, Angel/K-7825-2014	Rodriguez, Gerardo/0000-0001-5551-0612; Martin del Rey, Angel/0000-0002-3600-0016													0129-1831					OCT	2012	23	10							1250064	10.1142/S0129183112500647	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0129183112500647													WOS:000309682000001
J	Nejati, A; Soudjani, S; Zamani, M				Nejati, Ameneh; Soudjani, Sadegh; Zamani, Majid			Compositional abstraction-based synthesis for continuous-time stochastic hybrid systems	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												In this paper, we propose a compositional framework for the construction of discrete-time finite abstractions, also known as finite Markov decision processes, from continuous-time stochastic hybrid systems by quantifying the distance between their outputs in a probabilistic setting. The proposed scheme is based on the notion of stochastic simulation functions, which is used to relate continuous-time stochastic systems with their discrete-time counterparts. Accordingly, one can employ discrete-time abstract systems as substitutions of the continuous-time ones in the controller design process with guaranteed error bounds on their output trajectories. To this end, we first derive sufficient small-gain type conditions for the compositional quantification of the probabilistic distance between the interconnection of original continuous-time stochastic hybrid systems and their discrete-time (finite or infinite) abstractions. We then construct finite abstractions together with their corresponding stochastic simulation functions for a particular class of nonlinear stochastic hybrid systems having some stability property. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results by applying our approaches to the temperature regulation in a circular building and constructing compositionally a discrete-time abstraction from its original continuous-time dynamics in a network containing 1000 rooms. We employ the constructed discrete-time abstractions as substitutes to compositionally synthesize policies regulating the temperature of each room for a bounded time horizon.

To ensure the experience of edge computing services, we designed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted edge computing network application scenario. In the considered scenario, the UAV acts as a relay node to forward edge computing tasks when the performance of the wireless channel between UEs and ECSs degrades. In order to minimize the average delay of edge computing tasks, we design the optimization problem of joint UE-ECS matching and UAV three-dimensional hovering position deployment. Further, we transform this mixed integer nonlinear programming into a continuous-variable decision process and design the corresponding Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based joint optimization algorithm. Sufficient data pertaining to latency demonstrate that the suggested algorithm can obtain a seamless reward value when the number of training steps hits three million. This verifies the algorithm's desirable convergence property. Furthermore, the algorithm's efficacy has been confirmed through simulation in various environments. The experimental findings ascertain that the PPO-based co-optimization algorithm consistently attains a lower average latency rate and a minimum of 8% reduction in comparison to the baseline scenarios.

Continuous communication is avoided in triggering the conditions for monitoring and controller updates. Our general approach is to employ event-triggering laws with threshold mechanisms that depend on the states of the agents. We start with a static version and then generalize it so that it entails an internal auxiliary variable to regulate the threshold dynamically for each agent.

Optimization of complex integrated water and membrane network systems	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY												Water and energy are key resources in the process and mining industries. Increasing environmental and social pressures have made it necessary to develop processes that minimize the consumption of both these resources. This work considers the synthesis and optimization of water networks through partial treatment of water (regeneration) before recycle/re-use. Two types of membrane regenerators are considered, namely electrodialysis and reverse osmosis. For each of the membrane regenerators, a detailed design model is developed and incorporated into the water network model in order to minimize water and energy consumption, and operating and capital costs. This represents a rigorous design and accurate cost representation as compared to the 'black-box' approach. The presence of continuous and integer variables, as well as nonlinear constraints, renders the problem a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Four cases are presented. The first case looks at the incorporation of multiple electrodialysis regenerators with single contaminant streams within a water network (WN), while the second considers the multiple contaminant scenario. Case 3 examines the incorporation of a reverse osmosis network superstructure within a WN, and case 4 looks at both electrodialysis and reverse osmosis membranes. The developed models are applied to a pulp and paper and a petroleum case study to demonstrate their applicability, assuming both a single and multiple contaminant scenario. The model was solved in GAMS using BARON and DICOPT. The results indicate a wastewater reduction of up to 80% and savings of up to 44% in fresh water intake, 82% in energy, and 45% in the total annualized cost.

Dynamics of the master and slave robots are assumed to be continuous-time with discrete-time controllers. The proposed multirate design guarantees the exponential stability of the teleoperation system over a communication networks. Different sampling rates are imposed on position/velocity signals in both master and slave sides and by exerting input-delay approach, the multirate dynamics is transformed into a continuous-time system. Sufficient Krasovskiibased stability criteria are provided to preserve the exponential stability of the linear discrete-time system for asynchronously sampling intervals and update rates. This analysis is formulated as a convex optimization problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) to calculate the longest interval between two successive sampling periods. The proposed multirate approach demonstrates that selecting adequate intervals for samplers and proper update rates for actuators has a considerable effect on the stability of the system. In order to validate the stability criteria and present the efficacy of the proposed multirate scheme, pair of two degree of freedom manipulators will be investigated and maximum allowable sampling periods and update rates are computed to preserve the exponential stability for different multirate cases.

J	Qiu, BB; Zhang, YN; Yang, Z				Qiu, Binbin; Zhang, Yunong; Yang, Zhi			New Discrete-Time ZNN Models for Least-Squares Solution of Dynamic Linear Equation System With Time-Varying Rank-Deficient Coefficient	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												In this brief, a new one-step-ahead numerical differentiation rule called six-instant g-cube finite difference (6IgCFD) formula is proposed for the first-order derivative approximation with higher precision than existing finite difference formulas (i.e., Euler and Taylor types). Subsequently, by exploiting the proposed 6IgCFD formula to discretize the continuous-time Zhang neural network model, two new-type discrete-time ZNN (DTZNN) models, namely, new-type DTZNNK and DTZNNU models, are designed and generalized to compute the least-squares solution of dynamic linear equation system with time-varying rank-deficient coefficient in real time, which is quite different from the existing ZNN-related studies on solving continuous-time and discrete-time (dynamic or static) linear equation systems in the context of full-rank coefficients. Specifically, the corresponding dynamic normal equation system, of which the solution exactly corresponds to the least-squares solution of dynamic linear equation system, is elegantly introduced to solve such a rank-deficient least-squares problem efficiently and accurately. Theoretical analyses show that the maximal steady-state residual errors of the two new-type DTZNN models have an O(g(4)) pattern, where g denotes the sampling gap. Comparative numerical experimental results further substantiate the superior computational performance of the new-type DTZNN models to solve the rank-deficient least-squares problem of dynamic linear equation systems.																			2162-237X	2162-2388				NOV	2018	29	11					5767	5776		10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2805810	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2805810								29993872					WOS:000447832200049

The aim is to maximize the system energy efficiency subject to constraints on users' quality-of-service, capacity of fronthaul links and transmit power. Different to the conventional power consumption-models, we embrace the dependence of baseband signal processing power on the data rate, and the dynamics of the power amplifiers' efficiency. The considered problem is a mixed Boolean nonconvex program whose optimal solution is difficult to find. As our main contribution, we provide a discrete branch-reduce-and-bound (DBRnB) approach to solve the problem globally. We also make some modifications to the standard DBRnB procedure. Those remarkably improve the convergence performance. Numerical results are provided to confirm the validity of the proposed method.

In this study, the continuous-time derivative (CTD) model and two gradient dynamics (GD) models are developed for real-time varying nonlinear optimization (RTVNO). A continuous-time Zhang dynamics (CTZD) model is then generalized and investigated for RTVNO to remedy the weaknesses of CTD and GD models. For possible digital hardware realization, a discrete-time Zhang dynamics (DTZD) model, which can be further reduced to Newton-Raphson iteration (NRI), is also proposed and developed. Theoretical analyses indicate that the residual error of the CTZD model has an exponential convergence, and that the maximum steady-state residual error (MSSRE) of the DTZD model has an O(tau (2)) pattern with tau denoting the sampling gap. Simulation and numerical results further illustrate the efficacy and advantages of the proposed CTZD and DTZD models for RTVNO.

J	Soltani, H; Shafiei, S				Soltani, Hadi; Shafiei, Sirous			Adiabatic reactor network synthesis using coupled genetic algorithm with quasi linear programming method	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												In this paper a new approach is presented for synthesis of adiabatic reactor networks (ARNs) using genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with quasi linear programming (LP) method. In most cases reactor network (RN) synthesis leads to mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problems or complicated non-linear programming (NLP) problems. In the suggested method to prevent complexity, GA is used to find the best configuration while continuous variables are handled using a quasi LP formulation. In quasi LP model continuous variables are regrouped into (a) normal variables such as concentration, temperature and flow rate (b) variables which make the equations nonlinear such as conversion in each reactor, split ratio of streams, recycles and exit temperatures from coolers or heaters. To optimize continuous variables the quasi LP consists of two nested loops. In the outer loop variables of group (b) are optimized while variables of group (a) are obtained using known values of group (b) in the inner loop. Therefore the complex MINLP or NLP model is converted to a quasi LP which is much easier to solve. Although in the RN only continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) and plug flow reactors (PFR) are used. The cases studied showed that this method can reach near optimum and in some cases better solutions compared to the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to guarantee the convergence performance of such systems, an input filter is designed in front of actuators to estimate the controller updated input under the effect of those uncertainties. Specifically, a P-type learning controller is considered firstly, and then a model is developed to describe the transmission of sensor measured output data and controller updated input data under the mixed effect of those uncertainties. On the basis of state augmentation, the two developed data transmission processes are further combined with the controller learning process to build a unified filtering model. According to this filtering model and the projection theory, an optimal filter in linear minimum variance sense is designed at the actuator side to estimate the controller updated input in iteration domain. The convergence performance of the norm of filtering error covariance matrix is proved theoretically, which means driven by this accurately estimated input, the convergence performance of networked systems adopting the P-type learning controller is guaranteed. Finally, some numerical results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In line with this, the main purpose of this study is to develop a sustainable food Supply Chain Network (SCN). The SCN enables the collection of agro-food grains from different farmers' locations and delivers the same to food processing units. To design an efficient and effective sustainable pickup and delivery network, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) mathematical model is formulated. The proposed model achieves the sustainability goal by minimizing the collection costs. The developed MINLP model is solved by using an exact optimization approach in LINGO 18 software. Further, to test the efficacy of the developed model, various computational experiments are performed, varying from small to large size data. The results of these experiments reflect that our model can support businesses in designing an efficient and effective sustainable pickup and delivery network. Lastly, it has been shown that innovative packaging materials can help to minimize the wastage of food.

The mixed time delays are considered, which are comprised of both the discrete interval delays and infinite distributed delays. Meantime, two random variables obeying the Bernoulli distribution are utilised to depict the phenomena of randomly occurring discrete time-varying delay and distributed time-delay, in which the uncertain occurrence probabilities are modelled by the known scalars. An appropriate sliding surface function is firstly presented. Furthermore, some sufficient criteria via the free weighting matrices idea are obtained to ensure the admissibility of the resultant sliding motion by introducing new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Subsequently, an RASMC law is synthesised to ensure the reachability criterion of pre-designed sliding surface, where an adaptive mechanism is introduced to estimate the related unknown bounds. Finally, the feasibility of the new RASMC strategy is illustrated by a numerical simulation.

J	Chakraborty, A				Chakraborty, A.			A globally convergent mathematical model for synthesizing topologically constrained water recycle networks	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This paper develops a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to minimize fresh-water consumption in process plants by optimal recycle/reuse of process water. Prior work in this area ranged from insight-based graphical methods (pinch analysis) to mathematical programming. However, both approaches have drawbacks in incorporating topological constraints, e.g. constraints arising from capital cost considerations to limit network complexities, interconnections or forbidden source-sink matches. Mathematical programs often render themselves to MINLPs when incorporating topological constraints. To obtain reliable solution to the MINLPs, researchers often employed evolutionary search-based (stochastic) methods. Stochastic methods are computationally tedious and only render 'near-optimal' solutions to topologically constrained water-recycle networks. This paper will use some basic linearization of products of binary-continuous variables to cast the MINLP problem into an MILP formulation, thereby guaranteeing global optimality at significantly reduced computational burden. The computational advantage of the proposed MILP model over Genetic Algorithm (CA) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) will be demonstrated with the help of industrial case studies.

J	Díaz, J; Montoya, MC; Hernández, S				Diaz, J.; Cid Montoya, M.; Hernandez, S.			Efficient methodologies for reliability-based design optimization of composite panels	ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE												The main factors governing the design of composite laminates are the geometrical dimensions, the stacking sequence-including ply thickness and orientation angles-, the mechanical properties of the materials, the applied loads and the performance requirements. Most of these factors are commonly affected by uncertainty and this should be taken into account when designing these structures. Thus, uncertainty quantification should be used to evaluate the performance requirements and a reliability-based procedure is advisable when the design is optimized. However, these methods present several drawbacks, like the lack of trustworthy information about the uncertainty present in the variables of the model or the high computational cost required to apply the algorithms to medium to large models. This paper evaluates several methodologies for design optimization of composite panels under uncertainty. The uncertainty quantification is performed using stochastic expansion and limit state approximation methods. Monte Carlo sampling is also used to verify reliability results. The optimization process is carried out using gradient-based and genetic algorithms, with either continuous or discrete design variables. Surrogate methods, including polynomial, kriging, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and artificial neural networks, as well as parallel computing, have been leveraged to keep analysis times under acceptable levels. An application example of a stiffened composite panel of an aircraft fuselage is presented to demonstrate the computational performance and the accuracy of the methods. Results show major improvement in analysis time without compromising on precision. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we investigate how to prepare a certain single- or two-qubit target state from arbitrary initial states in semiconductor double quantum dots with only a few discrete control pulses by leveraging the deep reinforcement learning. Our method is based on the training of the network over numerous preparing tasks. The results show that once the network is well trained, it works for any initial states in the continuous Hilbert space. Thus repeated training for new preparation tasks is avoided. Our scheme outperforms the traditional optimization approaches based on gradient with both the higher efficiency and the preparation quality in discrete control space. Moreover, we find that the control trajectories designed by our scheme are robust against stochastic fluctuations within certain thresholds, such as the charge and nuclear noises.

Despite that this collision problem has been treated in existing RACH schemes by organizing IoT devices' transmission and re-transmission via the central control at the Base Station (BS), these existing RACH schemes are usually fixed over time, thus can hardly adapt to time-varying traffic patterns. In order to optimize the long-term objective in the number of success devices, this paper aims to design Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based optimizers with Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) for optimizing RACH schemes, including Access Class Barring (ACB), Back-Off (BO), and Distributed Queuing (DQ). Specifically, we apply DQN to handle discrete action selection for the BO as well as the DQ schemes, and DDPG to handle continuous action selection for the ACB scheme. Both agents are integrated with Gated recurrent unit Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network to approximate their value function/policy, which can improve the optimization performance by capturing temporal traffic correlations. Numerical results showcase that our proposed DRL-based optimizers considerably outperform conventional heuristic solutions in terms of the number of success access devices.					jiang, nan/AAV-1280-2021; Nallanathan, Arumugam/HCH-9017-2022; Deng, Yansha/ABD-2830-2020	jiang, nan/0000-0002-5337-890X; Nallanathan, Arumugam/0000-0001-8337-5884; Deng, Yansha/0000-0003-1001-7036													1550-3607		978-1-7281-5089-5				2020										10.1109/icc40277.2020.9149055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icc40277.2020.9149055													WOS:000606970302134

The hybrid precoder design is formulated as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by considering both continuous and discrete phase shift networks for implementing the analog precoder. The resulting optimization problem is nonconvex and difficult to solve. To that end, first, we apply a closed-form tight upper bound to approximate the ergodic rate. Then, we adopt Dinkelbach's algorithm and the iteratively weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method to obtain the fully digital precoders. After that, the alternating minimization and inexact majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms are utilized to compute the hybrid precoders. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithmic solutions achieve significant performance gains when compared to existing literature ones, especially in the case where the discrete phase shift network is employed for analog preceding.

Underground natural gas storage (UNGS) has the characteristics of large capacity and low gas storage cost, and it is usually used as the main storage and peak shaving method for natural gas. As an important part of the surface engineering of UNGSs, the surface gathering and transportation system is responsible for gas injection and production and has a significant impact on the economic benefits of the entire surface engineering. Therefore, the optimization of the entire surface system has a great impact on improving economic benefits. However, there is no relevant article on the optimization of the dual-pipe injection-production pipeline network for the surface system of UNGSs. This paper considers the dual-pipe injection-production pipeline network of underground gas storage and establishes a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model. The goal of this model is to minimize the total cost of pipelines, platforms, and central stations. Constraints are considered in the model, such as the connection mode, facility/well number, length, flow balance, capacity, pressure, flow rate, pipe diameter, wall thickness, and variable value. The GAMS/IPOPT solution algorithm is adopted to find the best topology of the model, including the position of the platform and the central station, pipe diameter, wall thickness, and gas pressure and flow rate. Finally, two cases are used to compare the single and dual-pipe network systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and the accuracy of the algorithm. The optimal results show that the mathematical model can reduce the total investment, and it can also guide the design and construction of the ground engineering of UNGSs.

We consider a scenario where a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas is serving a single antenna vehicular equipment (VE). We employ a two stage design approach; the first stage considers the beamforming design, and the second stage considers adaptive power allocation, and modulation designs for fixed beamforming. For the beamforming design, we apply the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) due to its optimality. And for fixed beamforming, the proposed design problem turns out to be a power and modulation adaptation problem which can be solved when the distribution of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is known. For this reason, we propose a novel and general approach to derive the statistical distribution of SNR by exploiting the structure of the array, the beamforming type and slow fading channel coefficients, and utilize the derived SNR distribution to design the power and modulation adaptation strategies. It is shown that the proposed design requires different power adaptation policies for continuous and discrete M-QAM modulations. All the analytical expressions have been verified by performing extensive simulations. Furthermore, we have examined the effect of different channel parameters on the proposed adaptation policies. We have observed that the proposed power allocation is very useful when the number of scatterers Ls and modulation order are very low. In all other cases, we have found that a constant power allocation is an optimal strategy for a medium to large Ls and modulation order.																					978-1-7281-3783-4				2020							90	96																WOS:000668567200014
J	Chu, YF; Wassick, JM; You, FQ				Chu, Yunfei; Wassick, John M.; You, Fengqi			Efficient scheduling method of complex batch processes with general network structure via agent-based modeling	AICHE JOURNAL												A novel efficient agent-based method for scheduling network batch processes in the process industry is proposed. The agent-based model is based on the resource-task network. To overcome the drawback of localized solutions found in conventional agent-based methods, a new scheduling algorithm is proposed. The algorithm predicts the objective function value by simulating another cloned agent-based model. Global information is obtained, and the solution quality is improved. The solution quality of this approach is validated by detailed comparisons with the mixed-integer programming (MIP) methods. A solution close to the optimal one can be found by the agent-based method with a much shorter computational time than the MIP methods. As a scheduling problem becomes increasingly complicated with increased scale, more specifications, and uncertainties, the advantages of the agent-based method become more evident. The proposed method is applied to simulated industrial problems where the MIP methods require excessive computational resources.

Imputation of Discrete and Continuous Missing Values in Large Datasets Using Bayesian Based Ant Colony Optimization	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												When preparing large databases, obtaining quality data for analysis without any missing values is almost impossible in many cases. Integration of raw data from multiple heterogeneous sources often results in some values missing leading to loss of valuable information. Even though many methods have been introduced by researchers, only less effort has been spent on handling missing values in heterogeneous attributes (both discrete and continuous) under Missing At Random pattern, the common scenario where missing values have dependency on covariates in the dataset. Also, only few techniques are capable of dealing with missing values in large databases and this demands immediate attention of researchers. This paper addresses both these problems by introducing a single technique called Bayesian Ant colony Optimization (BACO) which combines the searching capability of Ant Colony Optimization with probabilistic nature of Bayesian principles. The algorithm is designed in such a way that missing values in both discrete and continuous attributes in large datasets are efficiently imputed. BACO is implemented in six large real datasets, and it is observed that its imputation accuracy outperforms than that of existing standard techniques. The statistical tests conducted also prove the superior results of BACO in the imputation process.

Fusing Swarm Intelligence and Self-Assembly for Optimizing Echo State Networks	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE												Optimizing a neural network's topology is a difficult problem for at least two reasons: the topology space is discrete, and the quality of any given topology must be assessed by assigning many different sets of weights to its connections. These two characteristics tend to cause very "rough." objective functions. Here we demonstrate how self-assembly (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be integrated to provide a novel and effective means of concurrently optimizing a neural network's weights and topology. Combining SA and PSO addresses two key challenges. First, it creates a more integrated representation of neural network weights and topology so that we have just a single, continuous search domain that permits "smoother" objective functions. Second, it extends the traditional focus of self-assembly, from the growth of predefined target structures, to functional self-assembly, in which growth is driven by optimality criteria defined in terms of the performance of emerging structures on predefined computational problems. Our model incorporates a new way of viewing PSO that involves a population of growing, interacting networks, as opposed to particles. The effectiveness of our method for optimizing echo state network weights and topologies is demonstrated through its performance on a number of challenging benchmark problems.																			1687-5265	1687-5273					2015	2015								642429	10.1155/2015/642429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/642429								26346488					WOS:000359574100001
J	Yaghini, M; Nikoo, N; Ahadi, HR				Yaghini, Masoud; Nikoo, Nariman; Ahadi, Hamid Reza			AN INTEGER PROGRAMMING MODEL FOR ANALYSING IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT TRAIN TYPES ON RAILWAY LINE CAPACITY	TRANSPORT												The evaluation of railway line capacity is an important problem, which effects majority of problems in rail transportation planning. The railway capacity is dependent on infrastructure, traffic, and operating parameters. A key factor affecting railway line capacity is the impact of different train types. As the combination of different train types increases, more interference is generated. In this paper, for evaluation of train type interactions on railway line capacity, an integer-programming model for both line and line section is presented. The problem is formulated as a multicommodity network design model on a space-discrete time network. The railway capacity is calculated using data typically available to planners. The inputs of the model are the characteristic of each train type and railway line attributes. The model determines railway capacity based on train type mixes. In addition, this model considers impact of train types on capacity and waiting time. In order to show the features of the model, a case study is implemented in Iran Railways. The capacity tends to increase non-linearly with small incremental changes in parameters. The mixture of train types reduces the railway line capacity. The proposed model can help railway managers for long-term planning. Keywords: railway transportation, railway capacity, railway line, line section, siding track, discrete-time multicommodity network flow model, integer programming.

Continuous Vocal Imitation with Self-organized Vowel Spaces in Recurrent Neural Network	ICRA: 2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION, VOLS 1-7	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA				IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	MAY 12-17, 2009	Kobe, JAPAN	IEEE				A continuous vocal imitation system was developed using a computational model that explains the process of phoneme acquisition by infants. Human infants perceive speech sounds not as discrete phoneme sequences but as continuous acoustic signals. One of critical problems in phoneme acquisition is the design for segmenting these continuous speech sounds. The key idea to solve this problem is that articulatory mechanisms such as the vocal tract help human beings to perceive speech sound units corresponding to phonemes. To segment acoustic signal with articulatory movement, we apply the segmenting method to our system by Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias (RNNPB). This method determines the multiple segmentation boundaries in a temporal sequence using the prediction error of the RNNPB model, and the PB values obtained by the method can be encoded as kind of phonemes. Our system was implemented by using a physical vocal tract model, called the Maeda model. Experimental results demonstrated that our system can self-organize the same phonemes in different continuous sounds, and can imitate vocal sound involving arbitrary numbers of vowels using the vowel space in the RNNPB. This suggests that our model reflects the process of phoneme acquisition.

For instance, existing state-of-the-art organ segmentation methods learn discrete segmentation maps. Unfortunately, the memory requirements of such methods grow cubically with increasing spatial resolution, which makes them unsuitable for processing high resolution scans. To overcome this, we design an Implicit Organ Segmentation Network (IOSNet) that utilizes continuous Implicit Neural Representations and has several useful properties. Firstly, the IOSNet decoder memory is roughly constant and independent of the spatial resolution since it parameterizes the segmentation map as a continuous function. Secondly, IOSNet converges much faster than discrete voxel based methods due to its ability to accurately segment organs irrespective of organ sizes, thereby alleviating size imbalance issues without requiring any auxiliary tricks. Thirdly, IOSNet naturally supports super-resolution (i.e. sampling at arbitrary resolutions during inference) due to its continuous learnt representations. Moreover, despite using a simple lightweight decoder, IOSNet consistently outperforms the discrete specialized segmentation architecture UNet. Hence, our approach demonstrates that Implicit Neural Representations are well-suited for medical imaging applications, especially for processing high-resolution 3D medical scans.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-031-16443-9; 978-3-031-16442-2				2022	13435						433	443		10.1007/978-3-031-16443-9_42	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16443-9_42													WOS:000867370700042

One main result the paper presents is that under certain assumptions, optimal coding and control policies exist and are stationary. It is also shown that for the remote control of an open-loop unstable system over a discrete noisy communication channel, if the system is driven by a Brownian disturbance, stationary memoryless coding schemes or innovation coding schemes lead to an unstable system. This result is true even when the capacity of the discrete channel is arbitrarily high, but finite. In particular, sensor and controller designs for control of systems driven by noise over communication networks when modeled as continuous alphabet erasure channels, lead to instabitity when are applied to realistic channels. Conditions ensuring stability leading to a recurrent Markov chain are presented. To achieve this, one needs to use coding policies with non-trivial memory constructions.																			0743-1619	2378-5861	978-1-4244-2078-0				2008							3114	3119		10.1109/ACC.2008.4586971	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2008.4586971													WOS:000259261502081

Removing data redundancy brings many benefits in efficient data updating, effective data storage, and error-free query processing. While it has been studied for four decades, existing works on data redundancy mostly focus on syntactic formulations such as normal forms and functional dependencies, which lead to intractable discovery problems. In this work, we propose a new concept, namely functional redundancy, that overcomes the limitations of functional dependencies, especially on continuous data. We design and develop efficient algorithms based on generative adversarial networks to validate any functional redundancy without heavily depending on the number of attributes and the number of tuples like functional dependencies. The core idea is to use the imputation power of generative adversarial networks to model any semantic dependencies between attributes. Extensive experiments on different real-world and synthetic datasets show that our approach outperforms representative baselines, is applicable for first-order and high-order dependencies, and is extensible for different types of data.

David			A Machine Intelligence Designed Bayesian Network Applied to Alzheimer's Detection Using Demographics and Speech Data	COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS	Procedia Computer Science				Conference on Engineering Cyber Physical Systems: Applying Theory to Practice	NOV 02-04, 2016	Los Angeles, CA	Missouri Univ Sci & Technol				Bayesian networks (BNs) have classically been designed by two methods: expert approach (ask an expert for nodes and links) and data driven approach (infer them from data). An unexpected by-product of previous Alzheimer's / dementia research (presented at CAS2015) was yet another approach where the results of a hybrid design were used to configure a BN. A complex adaptive systems approach, (e.g. GA-SVM-oracle hybrid) can sift through the combinatorics of feature subset selection, yielding a modest set of only the most influential features. Then using known likelihoods of demographics associated to dementia, and assuming direct and independent influence of dementia upon speech features, the BN is specified. The conditional probabilities needed can be estimated with far fewer data than the traditional BN data-driven approach. Although BNs have advantages (intuitive interpretation and graceful handling of missing data) they also have challenges. We report initial implementation results that suggest the need to reduce continuous variables to discrete categories, and the still-remaining need to estimate a substantial number of conditional probabilities, remain challenges for BNs. We suggest some ways forward in the application of BNs with the objective of improving / refining Alzheimer's / dementia detection using speech.

Recently researchers developed the quasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington's landscape. The Quasi-potential U(x), derived from interactions in the gene regulatory network (GRN) of a cell, quantifies the relative stability of network states, which determine the effort required for state transitions in a multi-stable dynamical system. However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for continuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are important tools to study complex systems. In this paper, we provide a framework to quantify the landscape for discrete Boolean networks (BNs). We apply our framework to study pancreas cell differentiation where an ensemble of BN models is considered based on the structure of a minimal GRN for pancreas development. We impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to specific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to stable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas development. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint corresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to restrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class. We find that BNs with canalyzing/sign-compatible Boolean functions best capture the dynamics of pancreas cell differentiation. This framework can also determine the genes' influence on cell state transitions, and thus can facilitate the rational design of cell reprogramming protocols. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, to solve this real-time optimization problem, an efficient discrete differential evolution -driven approach named DDE is proposed. The DDE includes discrete versions of mutation and crossover schemes together with a usual selection operation. Furthermore, an additional operator called greedy local search operation is combined with the search procedure of the DDE to increase the convergence speed. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on 32 different traffic case studies generated based on the infrastructure of traffic network in Jurong area of Singapore. The optimization results produced by the DDE are compared with the optimal results achieved by the commercial GUROBI solver. The performance of the DDE is also compared with other metaheuristics namely ABC, GA, HS, Jaya, DSCA and DSCA-LS, which are designed in the literature to solve the TLSP. The performance comparison is analyzed using diverse metrics such as statistical values of optimization results, statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, average relative error percentage, and convergence analysis. The comparison illustrates the significantly better and promising search ability of the DDE as compared to the other metaheuristics.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The selective distribution of CB particles in the immiscible iPP/PE blends was determined by the interfacial tensions, but the morphologies of the polyblends strongly depended on the compounding method. The mild compounding method strongly affected PE phases to form triple phase morphology in the composites, which inhibited effective conductivity network formation in the low CB content range.

It is assumed that there exists a dynamic leader and the subgraph describing the communication topology among the followers is undirected and connected. The proposed global detectability condition extends the traditional local detectability condition to the networked case. By using the relative states of neighboring followers and the relative measurement information of the leader, distributed observer-type consensus protocols are constructed for both continuous- and discrete-time cases to guarantee all the followers to track the leader. A distinct feature of this paper is that the relative states of the leader are estimated by a group of followers rather than any individual follower. It is found that the mean square tracking errors are bounded even if the leader is not detectable by any follower, where the only requirement is that the leader is globally detectable by followers. Simulation results are finally presented to verify the effectiveness of theoretical results.

We commence by evaluating the NC discrete-input-continuous-output memoryless channel (DCMC) capacity of both the amplify-and-forward-based (AF) and decode-and-forward-based (DF) SRANs in the direct-sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA) uplink (UL). While NC detection has the added benefit of eliminating both the pilot overhead and the power-hungry channel estimation, it tends to form an error floor at high Doppler frequencies. We mitigate this problem using multiple-symbol detection, which increases the detection complexity upon extending the detection window. Finally, a relay-aided soft-input-soft-output multiple-symbol differential sphere detection (SISO-MSDSD) CDMA regime is proposed, which significantly reduces the system's complexity without sacrificing its performance.

Synthesis process uses three different types of external, rigid contact surfaces-circular, elliptical, and rectangular-which in combination, offer intricate local curvatures that CCMs can benefit from, to deliver desired, complex output characteristics. A network of line elements is employed to generate topologies. A set of circular subregions is laid over this network, and external contact surfaces are generated within each subregion. Both discrete and continuous design variables are employed-the former set controls the CCM topology, appearance and type of external contact surfaces, whereas the latter set governs shapes and sizes of the CCM constituents and sizes of contact surfaces. All contact types are permitted with contact modeling made significantly easier through identification of outer and inner loops. Line topologies are fleshed out via a user-defined number of quadrilateral elements along lateral and longitudinal directions. Candidate CCM designs are carefully preprocessed before analysis via a commercial software and evolved using a stochastic search. The process is exemplified via a contact-aided, three-kink mechanical switch which is thoroughly analyzed in the presence of friction and wear.																			1050-0472	1528-9001				AUG 1	2021	143	8							081704	10.1115/1.4049337	http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4049337													WOS:000671883000002

New MINLP Formulation for the Multiperiod Pooling Problem	AICHE JOURNAL												The modeling of blending tank operations in petroleum refineries for the most profitable production of liquid fuels in a context of time-varying supply and demand is addressed.

These are better handled by decomposition algorithms that divide the problem into integer and nonlinear components as well as by commercial solvers. In fact, BARON and GloMIQO can solve to global optimality all problems resulting from the new formulation and test problems from the literature.

Low-power continuous-wave nonlinear optics in doped silica glass integrated waveguide structures	NATURE PHOTONICS												Photonic integrated circuits are a key component(1) of future telecommunication networks, where demands for greater bandwidth, network flexibility, and low energy consumption and cost must all be met. The quest for all-optical components has naturally targeted materials with extremely large nonlinearity, including chalcogenide glasses(2) and semiconductors, such as silicon(3) and AlGaAs (ref. 4). However, issues such as immature fabrication technology for chalcogenide glass and high linear and nonlinear losses for semiconductors motivate the search for other materials. Here we present the first demonstration of nonlinear optics in integrated silica-based glass waveguides using continuous-wave light.

The proposed channel model supports the scenario where both transceivers and environments move. The evolution of clusters in the space domain and the practical discrete phase shifts are considered in the channel model. The steering vector is set at the base station for the cooperation with IRS. Through studying statistical properties, the non-stationary properties are verified. We find that IRS plays a role in separating the whole channel and makes the absolute value of time autocorrelation function (ACF) larger than the situation without employing IRS. Time ACF of the case using discrete phase shifts is also compared with the continuous case.

Recently, Zhang et al. developed the continuous-time and discrete-time forms of Zhang dynamics (ZD) for time-varying nonlinear minimization. Based on this previous work, another two discrete-time ZD (DTZD) algorithms are proposed and investigated in this paper. Specifically, the resultant DTZD algorithms are developed for time-varying nonlinear minimization by utilizing two different types of Taylor-type difference rules. Theoretically, each steady-state residual error in the DTZD algorithm changes in an O(tau (3)) manner with tau being the sampling gap. Comparative numerical results are presented to further substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed DTZD algorithms for time-varying nonlinear minimization.

We propose a class of discrete-time recursive algorithms to calculate the weighted second-order moment statics in a distributed way. Different from the continuous-time algorithm, the jumping of the states in discrete-time algorithms makes the convergence analysis much more difficult. In this paper, we first give some sufficient conditions on the control input for driving the whole system to function consensus. Then based on the conditions, we design the algorithm and show that if the communication topology is connected, then by adjusting the communication gain between adjacent agents properly, the proposed distributed algorithm can drive all agents' states to the square root of the weighted second-order moment statistics of the initial values. The numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our algorithms.

J	Naor, M; Wieder, U				Naor, Moni; Wieder, Udi			Novel Architectures for P2P Applications: The Continuous-Discrete Approach	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ALGORITHMS												We propose a new approach for constructing P2P networks based on a dynamic decomposition of a continuous space into cells corresponding to servers. We demonstrate the power of this approach by suggesting two new P2P architectures and various algorithms for them. The first serves as a DHT (distributed hash table) and the other is a dynamic expander network. The DHT network, which we call Distance Halving, allows logarithmic routing and load while preserving constant degrees. It offers an optimal tradeoff between degree and path length in the sense that degree d guarantees a path length of O (log(d) n). Another advantage over previous constructions is its relative simplicity. A major new contribution of this construction is a dynamic caching technique that maintains low load and storage, even under the occurrence of hot spots. Our second construction builds a network that is guaranteed to be an expander. The resulting topologies are simple to maintain and implement. Their simplicity makes it easy to modify and add protocols. A small variation yields a DHT which is robust against random Byzantine faults. Finally we show that, using our approach, it is possible to construct any family of constant degree graphs in a dynamic environment, though with worse parameters. Therefore, we expect that more distributed data structures could be designed and implemented in a dynamic environment.																			1549-6325	1549-6333				AUG	2007	3	3							34	10.1145/1273340.1273350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1273340.1273350													WOS:000494447800010

Measuring and optimizing system reliability: a stochastic programming approach	TOP												We propose a computational framework to quantify (measure) and to optimize the reliability of complex systems. The approach uses a graph representation of the system that is subject to random failures of its components (nodes and edges). Under this setting, reliability is defined as the probability of finding a path between sources and sink nodes under random component failures and we show that this measure can be computed by solving a stochastic mixed-integer program. The stochastic programming setting allows us to account for system constraints and general probability distributions to characterize failures and allows us to derive optimization formulations that identify designs of maximum reliability. We also propose a strategy to approximately solve these problems in a scalable manner by using purely continuous formulations.

Yalcin			Sparse Network Optimization for Synchronization	JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												We propose new mathematical optimization models for generating sparse dynamical graphs, or networks, that can achieve synchronization. The synchronization phenomenon is studied using the Kuramoto model, defined in terms of the adjacency matrix of the graph and the coupling strength of the network, modelling the so-called coupled oscillators. Besides sparsity, we aim to obtain graphs which have good connectivity properties, resulting in small coupling strength for synchronization. We formulate three mathematical optimization models for this purpose. Our first model is a mixed integer optimization problem, subject to ODE constraints, reminiscent of an optimal control problem. As expected, this problem is computationally very challenging, if not impossible, to solve, not only because it involves binary variables but also some of its variables are functions. The second model is a continuous relaxation of the first one, and the third is a discretization of the second, which is computationally tractable by employing standard optimization software. We design dynamical graphs that synchronize, by solving the relaxed problem and applying a practical algorithm for various graph sizes, with randomly generated intrinsic natural frequencies and initial phase variables. We test robustness of these graphs by carrying out numerical simulations with random data and constructing the expected value of the network's order parameter and its variance under this random data, as a guide for assessment.

J	Wang, Q; Wu, DP; Fan, PY				Wang, Qing; Wu, Dapeng; Fan, Pingyi			Effective capacity of a correlated Rayleigh fading channel	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING												The next generation wireless networks call for quality of service (QoS) support. The effective capacity (EC) proposed by Wu and Negi provides a powerful tool for the design of QoS provisioning mechanisms. In their previous work, Wu and Negi derived a formula for effective capacity of a Rayleigh fading channel with arbitrary Doppler spectrum. However, their paper did not provide simulation results to verify the accuracy of the EC formula derived in their paper. This is due to difficulty in simulating a Rayleigh fading channel with a Doppler spectrum of continuous frequency, required by the EC formula. To address this difficulty, we develop a verification methodology based on a new discrete-frequency EC formula; different from the EC formula developed by Wu and Negi, our new discrete-frequency EC formula can be used in practice. Through simulation, we verify that the EC formula developed by Wu and Negi is accurate. Furthermore, to facilitate the application of the EC theory to the design of practical QoS provisioning mechanisms in wireless networks, we propose a spectral-estimation-based algorithm to estimate the EC function, given channel measurements; we also analyze the effect of spectral estimation error on the accuracy of EC estimation. Simulation results show that our proposed spectral-estimation-based EC estimation algorithm is accurate, indicating the excellent practicality of our algorithm.

J	Chen, SQ; Shen, B; Wee, SS; Zhang, XD				Chen, Songqing; Shen, Bo; Wee, Susie; Zhang, Xiaodong			SProxy: A caching infrastructure to support Internet streaming	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA												Many algorithmic efforts have been made to address technical issues in designing a streaming media caching proxy. Typical of those are segment-based caching approaches that efficiently cache large media objects in segments which reduces the startup latency while ensuring continuous streaming. However, few systems have been practically implemented and deployed. The implementation and deployment efforts are hindered by several factors: 1) streaming of media content in complicated data formats is difficult; 2) typical streaming protocols such as RTP often run on UDP; in practice, UDP traffic is likely to be blocked by firewalls at the client side due to security considerations; and 3) coordination between caching discrete object segments and streaming continuous media data is challenging. To address these problems, we have designed and implemented a segment-based streaming media proxy, called SProxy. This proxy system has the following merits. First, SProxy leverages existing Internet infrastructure to address the flash crowd. The content server is now free of the streaming duty while hosting streaming content through a regular Web server. Thus, UDP based streaming traffic from SProxy suffers less dropping and no blocking. Second, SProxy streams and caches media objects in small segments determined by the object popularity, causing very low startup latency, and significantly reducing network traffic. Finally, prefetching techniques are used to pro-actively preload uncached segments that are likely to be used soon, thus providing continuous streaming. SProxy has been extensively tested and we show that it provides high quality streaming delivery in both local area networks and wide area networks (e.g., between Japan and the U.S.).																			1520-9210					AUG	2007	9	5					1062	1072		10.1109/TMM.2007.898943	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2007.898943													WOS:000248314800015

Resource-aware MPC for constrained linear systems: Two rollout approaches	JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL												In systems with resource constraints, such as actuation limitations in sparse control applications or limited bandwidth in networked control systems, it is desirable to use control signals that are either sparse or sporadically changing in time. Motivated by these applications, in this paper we propose two resource aware MPC schemes for discrete-time linear systems subject to state and input constraints. The two MPC schemes exploit ideas from rollout strategies to determine simultaneously the new (continuous) control inputs and the (discrete) time instants at which the control actions are updated. The first scheme provides performance guarantees by design, in the sense that it allows the user to select a desired suboptimal level of performance, where the degree of suboptimality provides a trade-off between the guaranteed closed loop control performance on the one hand and the utilization of (communication/actuation) resources on the other hand. The second scheme provides a guaranteed (average) resource utilization, while cleverly allocating these resources in order to maximize the control performance. By means of numerical examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design of state estimator for bidirectional associative memory neural networks with leakage delays	INFORMATION SCIENCES												This paper considers the issue of state estimation for a class of bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks. More precisely, the BAM model is considered with mixed delays which includes a constant delay in the leakage term, time-varying discrete delay and constant distributed delay. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) together with free-weighting matrix technique, a new delay dependent sufficient condition is derived to estimate the neuron states through available output measurements such that, for all admissible delay bounds, the resulting estimation error system is globally asymptotically stable. Also it is assumed that the derivative of time delay is not necessarily zero or less than one. Further the derived conditions are formulated in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved by using some standard numerical packages. Finally a numerical example with simulation result is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed theory. The result reveals that the leakage delays have a destabilizing influence on the system and they cannot be ignored. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Traditional design methods of irrigation systems consider primarily the hydraulic aspects. Inclusion of water quality aspects requires new tailored design methods. The method suggested herein is part of a continuous effort taken in that direction. Earlier works paved the way for the presently suggested design model which computes the feasibility domain of water discharge and quality of supply networks. Steady-state conditions, conservative water quality parameters, instantaneous and complete mixing of water from diverse water quality sources were assumed. The Q-C (chemical transport sub-problem) was dealt with and the QC feasibility domains of sources for the inner nodes and outlets were computed for every feasible flow pattern in a given network. Feasibility of supply was evaluated by comparing demand (water discharge and quality) values with the supply values computed by the QCFD. Real water supply in a rural community in the Arava desert, Israel, was designed using the QCFD model. Feasibility of various irrigation schedules was tested and a guideline for operation derived. The method, however, needs further improvement.

A stage-wise superstructure containing a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a plug flow reactor (PFR) is used to formulate the mathematical model without the use of differential equations and with a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation. To solve the optimization problem a bi-level meta-heuristic approach combining simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used. Two case studies involving complex nonisothermal homogeneous reaction systems were used to test the applicability of this technique, and a methodology based on temperature profiles was developed to guide the search for operating temperatures during the optimization. The results achieved improvements in the objective function when compared to the majority of results reported in the literature, which demonstrates that the developed methodology is suitable to perform the reactor network synthesis in homogeneous systems.

A new couple-group consensus agreement has been designed for this heterogeneous MASs with time delay. On the basis of delta operator and stability theory, couple-group consensus of the continuous or discrete systems can be transformed to analyze stability of a system with time lag. By using stability theory and LMI (Linear matrix inequality) technique, some meaningful results are put forward to obtain couple-group consensus of the heterogeneous MASs. In addition, these conclusions are also suitable for MASs whose switched topologies networks can't meet the equilibrium of in-degree or can't meet the requirements of any sub-topology with a spanning tree.

We developed a simulator for power loss evaluation aiming at being able to target different power devices (either discrete or power module) and substrates (PCB or ceramic based). In order to provide accurate simulations, we estimate power losses using a mix of analytical formulae populated with empirical data.

Intrinsically Bayesian Robust Kalman Filter: An Innovation Process Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING												In many contemporary engineering problems, model uncertainty is inherent because accurate system identification is virtually impossible owing to system complexity or lack of data on account of availability, time, or cost. The situation can be treated by assuming that the true model belongs to an uncertainty class of models. In this context, an intrinsically Bayesian robust (IBR) filter is one that is optimal relative to the cost function (in the classical sense) and the prior distribution over the uncertainty class (in the Bayesian sense). IBR filters have previously been found for both Wiener and granulometric morphological filtering. In this paper, we derive the IBR Kalman filter that performs optimally relative to an uncertainty class of state-space models. Introducing the notion of Bayesian innovation process and the Bayesian orthogonality principle, we show how the problem of designing an IBR Kalman filter can be reduced to a recursive system similar to the classical Kalman recursive equations, except with "effective" counterparts, such as the effective Kalman gain matrix. After deriving the recursive IBR Kalman equations for discrete time, we use the limiting method to obtain the IBR Kalman-Bucy equations for continuous time. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for two real world problems: sensor networks and gene regulatory network inference.

J	Pistoresi, C; Fan, YL; Luo, LG				Pistoresi, Cyril; Fan, Yilin; Luo, Lingai			Numerical study on the improvement of flow distribution uniformity among parallel mini-channels	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING-PROCESS INTENSIFICATION												Parallel micro or mini-channels are widely used in various devices of process and energy engineering including micro-reactors, compact heat exchangers and fuel cells. Nevertheless, the flow maldistribution due to the improper design of distributor/collector is usually observed, leading to globally poor performances of these devices. The objective of this study is to optimize the shape of the distributor/collector pipes so as to achieve a uniform flow distribution among an array of parallel mini-channels. A Z-type ladder fluid network with 10 mini-channels in parallel having square section is introduced and investigated. Two methods are used to optimize the shape of distributor/collector pipes: an optimized discrete stairway shape and a continuous tapered shape with an inclined angle varying from 0 degrees to 30 degrees. 3D-CFD simulations are carried out using the ANSYS FLUENT code. Numerical results obtained show that a relatively uniform flow distribution may be reached by the discrete stairway shape or by the continuous tapered shape distributor/collector under very low flow-rate conditions. Larger inclined angle or fewer channels in parallel are favorable for more uniform flow distribution under higher flow-rate conditions. Nevertheless the distributor and the collector pipes occupy a large volume so that the entire device is less compact. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, JG; Su, K; Wu, YC				Wang, Jiguang; Su, Kan; Wu, Yucai			The Reliable Facility Location Problem Under Random Disruptions	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS												The classical location models implicitly assume that the facilities, once built, will always operate as planned. However, some of the facilities may become unavailable from time to time due to disruptions caused by natural disasters, key-supplier bankruptcy, terrorist attacks, or labor strikes. Therefore, supply chain disruptions have gained considerable attention by researchers and practitioners in the past few decades. The catastrophic accidents highlighted the urgent need for effective solutions to manage supply chain disruptions in spite of their low probability of occurrence. Therefore, it is critical to take account of disruptions when designing supply chain networks so that they perform well as a whole even after a disruption. Taking into account the random disruption risk, this paper proposes a mixed integer programming model for the reliable facility location problem. This model try to minimize the sum of initial facility construction costs and expected transportation costs in both the regular and the failure scenarios, and present a Lagrange relaxation algorithm to solve it. This paper also analyzes the algorithm's solving performance by a numerical experiment.

By using the event-sampled neural network (NN) to approximate the unknown nonlinear function, an adaptive model and an associated event-triggered controller are designed by exploiting the backstepping method. In the proposed method, the feedback signals and the NN weights are aperiodically updated only when the event-triggered condition is violated. A positive lower bound on the minimum intersample time is guaranteed to avoid accumulation point. The closed-loop stability of the resulting nonlinear impulsive dynamical system is rigorously proved via Lyapunov analysis under an adaptive event sampling condition. In comparing with the traditional adaptive backstepping design with a fixed sample period, the event-triggered method samples the state and updates the NN weights only when it is necessary. Therefore, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

GKNet: Grasp keypoint network for grasp candidates detection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH												Contemporary grasp detection approaches employ deep learning to achieve robustness to sensor and object model uncertainty. The two dominant approaches design either grasp-quality scoring or anchor-based grasp recognition networks. This paper presents a different approach to grasp detection by treating it as keypoint detection in image-space. The deep network detects each grasp candidate as a pair of keypoints, convertible to the grasp representation g = {x,y,w,theta}( T ), rather than a triplet or quartet of corner points. Decreasing the detection difficulty by grouping keypoints into pairs boosts performance. To promote capturing dependencies between keypoints, a non-local module is incorporated into the network design. A final filtering strategy based on discrete and continuous orientation prediction removes false correspondences and further improves grasp detection performance. GKNet, the approach presented here, achieves a good balance between accuracy and speed on the Cornell and the abridged Jacquard datasets (96.9% and 98.39% at 41.67 and 23.26 fps). Follow-up experiments on a manipulator evaluate GKNet using four types of grasping experiments reflecting different nuisance sources: static grasping, dynamic grasping, grasping at varied camera angles, and bin picking. GKNet outperforms reference baselines in static and dynamic grasping experiments while showing robustness to varied camera viewpoints and moderate clutter. The results confirm the hypothesis that grasp keypoints are an effective output representation for deep grasp networks that provide robustness to expected nuisance factors.

The objective is to design control protocols so that the leaders will converge to a certain desired formation while the followers converge to the convex hull of the leaders. A novel protocol is proposed by exploiting the control input information of neighbors. Both continuous-time and discrete-time systems are considered. For continuous-time systems, it is proved that the protocol is robust to any constant delays of the neighbors' control inputs. For discrete-time systems, a sufficient condition on the feedback gain for the containment control is given in terms of the time delay and graph information. Some numerical examples are given to demonstrate the results. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

For two timescale-type NNs (TNNs), how to develop adaptive synchronization control schemes and demonstrate rigorously is still an open problem. This article concentrates on adaptive control design for synchronization of TNNs with unbounded time-varying delays. First, timescale-type Barbalat lemma and novel timescale-type inequality techniques are first proposed, which provides us practical methods to investigate timescale-type nonlinear systems. Second, using timescale-type calculus, novel timescale-type inequality, and timescale-type Barbalat lemma, we demonstrate that global asymptotic synchronization can be achieved via adaptive control under algebraic and matrix inequality criteria even if the time-varying delays are unbounded and nondifferentiable. Adaptive DRS is discussed for TNNs, which implies our control schemes are suitable for continuous-time NNs, their discrete-time counterparts, and any combination of them. Finally, numerical examples on TNNs and timescale-type chaotic Ikeda-like oscillator with unbounded time-varying delays are carried out to verify the adaptive control schemes.

These network intrusion detection systems have been studied together with machine learning and deep learning, but performance is not guaranteed in the actual environment or the class balance problem has not been solved. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the performance of a discretization preprocessing method with a CNN-based classifier on the class imbalance problem of network traffic data. The preprocessing method adds a discretization algorithm for continuous variables in the commonly used conventional preprocessing method and converts 1D network packet vectors into 2D image vectors to improve relational analysis and generalization performance. Since the convolution neural network has immutability to the input data, it improves statistical efficiency in learning network packets converted into images. To evaluate the proposed model, we compared the computational complexity and generalization performance using NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC-IDS 2018, which is a representative network packet data. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that in the case of computational complexity, training time and parameters were reduced compared to the model designed similarly to the proposed model, and accuracy and F1 score improved in generalization performance.

To fully exploit the advantages of NOMA, user (UE) pairing and beamforming design are jointly optimized via a generalized model for UE association, subject to energy efficiency maximization. Owing to the combination of binary variables and nonconvex constraints, the resulting optimization problem belongs to the class of mixed-integer nonconvex programming. An innovative algorithm, integrating the inner-approximation and Dinkelbach methods, is proposed herein to address a nonconvex fractional function. By introducing a pairing matrix and relaxing the binary variables into continuous ones, our approach is capable of reaching an optimal solution, where two arbitrary UEs are optimally paired regardless of geographical or spatial constraints. For practical scenarios, we further propose a robust design to manage the effect of channel estimation errors under settings involving channel uncertainty. Numerical results show that our proposed designs, even with the presence of the imperfect channel state information at the base station, significantly outperform the conventional beamforming and existing pairing schemes.

Distributed Optimization for Robot Networks: From Real-Time Convex Optimization to Game-Theoretic Self-Organization	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE												Recent advances in sensing, communication, and computing technologies have enabled the use of multirobot systems for practical applications such as surveillance, area mapping, and search and rescue. For such systems, a major challenge is to design decision rules that are real-time-implementable, require local information only, and guarantee some desired global performance. Distributed optimization provides a framework for designing such local decision-making rules for multirobot systems. In this article, we present a collection of selected results for distributed optimization for robot networks. We will focus on two special classes of problems: 1) real-time path planning for multirobot systems and 2) self-organization in multirobot systems using game-theoretic approaches. For multirobot path planning, we will present some recent approaches that are based on approximately solving distributed optimization problems over continuous and discrete domains of actions. The main idea underlying these approaches is that a variety of path planning problems can be formulated as convex optimization and submodular minimization problems over continuous and discrete action spaces, respectively. To generate local update rules that are efficiently implementable in real time, these approaches rely on approximate solutions to the global problems that can still guarantee some level of desired global performance. For game-theoretic self-organization, we will present a sampling of results for area coverage and real-time target assignment. In these results, the problems are formulated as games, and online updating rules are designed to enable teams of robots to achieve the collective objective in a distributed manner.

Event-triggered Fault Detection for Discrete-time Linear Multi-agent Systems	2016 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)	Proceedings of the American Control Conference				American Control Conference (ACC)	JUL 06-08, 2016	Boston, MA	Amer Automat Control Council				This paper studies the design and development of event-triggered fault detection (FD) filters for discrete-time linear multi-agent systems. For each agent, an FD filter is designed that receives the output measurements from its neighboring agents whenever specific event conditions are satisfied. With our proposed methodology all agents collaborate with one another to detect the occurrence of faults in the team and each agent not only can detect its own fault but also is capable of detecting its neighbor's fault. The filter parameters and the event conditions are designed such that a mixed II infinity /II- performance index is guaranteed and it is shown that by using an event-triggered technique, the amount of data that is sent by each agent to its neighboring agents is dramatically decreased. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of the problem are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) where extended LMI characterizations are used to reduce the conservativeness of the multi-objective H-infinity/H- problem. Simulation results corresponding to a team of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of the proposed methodology.

The considered uncertainties are edge-based multiplicative ones that are bounded in H-8 norm. The edge sensitivity function matrix (ESFM) and the edge complementary sensitivity function matrix (ECSFM) are defined for the continuous-and discrete-time MASs. Then, an edge sensitivity scheme is used for seeking the filter parameters, by which we show that the consensusability margins of MASs are associated with the edge complementary sensitivity function matrices of the MASs. The parameter conditions for the recursive filters are also be provided, under which the robust consensus with multiplicative uncertainties is achieved with maximal consensusability margins.

A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approach for Simultaneous Ethanol Supply Chain and Involved Plants Design Considering Production Scheduling	ICHEAP-11: 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CHEMICAL AND PROCESS ENGINEERING, PTS 1-4	Chemical Engineering Transactions				11th International Conference on Chemical and Process Engineering (ICheaP)	JUN 02-05, 2013	Milan, ITALY					In this work, a mixed integer programming model for the optimal design and production scheduling of an integrated ethanol/yeast supply chain is proposed. The model simultaneously determines the structure of a three-echelon supply chain (raw material sites-production facilities-customer zones), material flows among network nodes, the design of each installed plant, and the corresponding production campaign. For the selected facilities, out of phase duplication is considered for batch stages, while for equipment design, the optimal sizes are selected from a set of discrete unit values. Also, the number of batches of each product in the campaign and its sequencing for each ethanol/yeast plant are obtained. From the mathematical point of view, a new challenge is posed in this problem: the appropriate production campaign composition for each plant cannot be easily determined since products to be produced in each plant, as well as their production levels, are results of the supply chain design problem which is simultaneously optimized. Therefore, the trade-offs among all these decisions are jointly evaluated in an integrated model. Several examples are considered in order to provide insights into the problem. The presented approach serves as a tool for guiding the decision making for designing and planning supply chain and involved production plants.

The economic and environmental values of a reverse network depend significantly on the quality of the end-of-use products and the remanufacturing policies. Therefore, it is desirable to consider the minimum quality level of the remanufacturing and the remanufacturing policy during the initial design stage. A redesign of the reverse logistics network is addressed based on decisions made regarding the location of the collection facility, the allocation, the minimum quality level and the remanufacturing policies. Based on the known continuous distribution for the quality of an end-of-use product, a bi-objective mathematical model was developed. A mathematical model was then transformed into mixed integer programmes using quadratic terms in the constraints through the development of a discretisation method. To obtain Pareto solutions of a bi-objective model, a quality constraint method was developed by relaxing the non-linearity and complexity of the original epsilon constraint method. The proposed mathematical model and algorithm were able to redesign reverse logistics network throughout the entire processes of collection, transportation and remanufacturing. The validity of the model and accessibility for a large size problem demonstrated through numerical experiments are described herein.

Commonly used methods include machine learning, artificial neural networks, and so on. However, these methods only extract the continuous or discrete features of sequences, which have the drawbacks of low information utilization, poor robustness, and computational complexity. To solve these problems, this paper innovatively uses Wasserstein distance instead of Kullback-Leibler divergence and uses it to construct an autoencoder to learn discrete features of time series. Then, a hidden Markov model is used to learn the continuous features of the sequence. Finally, stacking is used to ensemble the two models to obtain the final model. This paper experimentally verifies that the ensemble model has lower computational complexity and is close to state-of-the-art classification accuracy.

In this paper, we present a new CS algorithm, called NCS, for solving flow shop scheduling problems (FSSP). The NCS hybridizes four strategies: (1) The FSSP is a typical NP-hard problem with discrete characteristics. To deal with the discrete variables, the smallest position value (SPV) rule is employed to convert continuous solutions into discrete job permutations; (2) To generate high quality initial solutions, a new method based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic is used for population initialization; (3) A modified generalized opposition-based learning (GOBL) is utilized to accelerate the convergence speed; and (4) To enhance the exploitation, a local search strategy is proposed. Experimental study is conducted on a set of Taillard's benchmark instances. Results show that NCS obtains better performance than the standard CS and some other meta-heuristic algorithms.

J	Tokos, H; Pintaric, ZN				Tokos, Hella; Pintaric, Zorka Novak			Synthesis of batch water network for a brewery plant	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												This paper presents an industrial application of mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models for the optimisation of a water network, which was initiated by an integral need for cleaner production within a brewery. Several mathematical models were developed in order to reduce the use of freshwater, whilst considering the specific requirements of each particular production section. These models are based on the design method developed by Kim and Smith [1]. The original formulation is modified to enable efficient integration of discontinuous and semi-continuous water-using processes in the packaging area. Semi-continuous processes are treated as water sources of limited capacity. The option of installing storage tanks for semi-continuous water streams is included in the model, in order to re-use these streams during the shutdown periods of semi-continuous operations. The original model is additionally extended with the option of installing local (on-site) wastewater treatment units operating either in batch or semi-continuous modes. This enables the analysing of opportunities for regeneration re-use within the production area, i.e. the brewhouse with a cellar, because of high contaminant concentrations at these sites. The scheduling of batch wastewater treatment units is performed simultaneously in order to adjust the treatment schedule to a fixed schedule of batch processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Extended passive filtering for discrete-time singular Markov jump systems with time-varying delays	SIGNAL PROCESSING												In this paper, the extended passive filtering problem is investigated for a class of discrete time singular Markov jump systems (SMJSs) with time-varying delays. Our attention is focused on the design of a general filter which contains the mode-independent part and the mode-dependent part to address the filtering issue. By employing some novel inequalities based on Abel lemma, some sufficient conditions which ensure the considered SMJSs to be stochastically admissible with a mixed H-infinity and passive performance gamma are established. Based on the conditions, an explicit expression for the desired filter is given. Two numerical examples and a dynamical Leontief model of economic systems are given to demonstrate the reduced conservatism and effectiveness of the presented general filter technique.

J	Lee, KH; Huang, BA				Lee, Kwan Ho; Huang, Biao			H structured model reduction algorithms for linear discrete systems via LMI-based optimisation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE												In this article, H structured model reduction is addressed for linear discrete systems. Two important classes of systems are considered for structured model reduction, i.e. Markov jump systems and uncertain systems. The problem we deal with is the development of algorithms with the flexibility to allow any structure in the reduced-order system design, such as the structure of an original system, decentralisation of a networked system, pole assignment of the reduced system, etc. The algorithms are derived such that an associated model reduction error guarantees to satisfy a prescribed H norm-bound constraint. A new condition for the existence of desired reduced-order models preserving a certain structure is presented in a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and non-convex equality constraints. Effective computational algorithms involving LMI are suggested to solve the matrix inequalities characterising a solution of the structured model reduction problem. Numerical examples demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model reduction method.

The system sum rate maximization framework is formulated by jointly optimizing subcarrier allocation, base station transmit beamforming and IRS phase shift. Considering the continuous and discrete hybrid action space characteristics of the optimization variables, we propose an efficient resource allocation algorithm combining multiple deep Q networks (MDQN) and deep deterministic policy-gradient (DDPG) to deal with this issue. In our algorithm, MDQN are employed to solve the problem of large discrete action space, while DDPG is introduced to tackle the continuous action allocation. Compared with the traditional approaches, our proposed MDQN-DDPG based algorithm has the advantage of continuous behavior improvement through learning from the environment. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance of our design in terms of system sum rate compared with the benchmark schemes.

This creates an apparent conflict with common resource limitations in these systems, given that, for instance, lengthy message authentication codes (MAC) introduce significant overheads. We present a framework to ensure both timing guarantees for real-time network messages and Quality-of-Control (QoC) in the presence of network-based attacks. We exploit physical properties of controlled systems to relax constant integrity enforcement requirements, and show how the problem of feasibility testing of intermittently authenticated real-time messages can be cast as a mixed integer linear programming problem. Besides scheduling a set of real-time messages with predefined authentication rates obtained from QoC requirements, we show how to optimally increase the overall system QoC while ensuring that all real-time messages are schedulable. Finally, we introduce an efficient runtime bandwidth allocation method, based on opportunistic scheduling, in order to improve QoC. We evaluate our framework on a standard benchmark designed for CAN bus, and show how an infeasible message set with strong security guarantees can be scheduled if dynamics of controlled systems are taken into account along with real-time requirements.

By utilizing zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) method, a continuous-time ZND (CTZND) model is first proposed for solving the corresponding continuous-time nonlinear optimization (CTNO) problem. Afterwards, three different explicit linear multi-step methods (i.e., explicit linear 3-step, 2-step, and 1 step methods) are respectively presented and investigated. To solve such a DTNO problem, the explicit linear 3-step method is adopted to combine with the CTZND model, and hence a 3-step discrete-time ZND (DTZND) model is proposed. For comparison purposes, 2-step and 1-step DTZND models are also developed. Besides, theoretical analyses indicate the validity and superiority of the proposed 3-step DTZND model. Finally, the numerical experimental results based on a 2-joint robot manipulator and a PUMA560 robot manipulator further verify that the proposed 3-step DTZND model is much superior to the other two DTZND models.

Among the relevant properties in an industrial context, the verification of partial monotony may become mandatory. This paper proposes a method to evaluate themonotony property using aMixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver. Contrary to the existing literature, this monotony analysis provides a lower and upper bound of the space volume where the property does not hold, that we denote "Non-Monotonic Space Coverage". This work has several advantages: (i) our formulation of the monotony property works on discrete inputs, (ii) the iterative nature of our algorithm allows for refining the analysis as needed, and (iii) from an industrial point of view, the results of this evaluation are valuable to the aeronautical domain where it can support the certification demonstration. We applied this method to an avionic case study (braking distance estimation using a neural network) where the verification of the monotony property is of paramount interest from a safety perspective.

To address this challenging mixed-integer non-linear problem, we decompose it into an optimization problem (P1) with continuous variables and a matching problem (P2) with integer variables. For the non-convex optimization problem (P1), iterative algorithms are proposed for allocating transmit power, designing reflection matrix, and determining decoding order by invoking relaxation methods such as convex upper bound substitution, successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation. For the combinational problem (P2), swap matching-based algorithms are proposed to achieve a two-sided exchange-stable state among users, BSs and subchannels.

We investigate the joint design of precoding, multivariate compression and RU-user selection which maximizes the energy efficiency of downlink C-RAN networks. The considered problem is inherently a rank-constrained mixed Boolean nonconvex program for which a globally optimal solution is difficult and computationally expensive to find. In order to derive practically appealing solutions, we invoke some useful relaxation and transformation techniques to arrive at a more tractable (but still nonconvex) continuous program. To solve the relaxation problem, we propose an iterative procedure based on DC algorithms which is provably convergent. Numerical results demonstrate the superior of the proposed solution in terms of achievable energy efficiency compared to existing schemes.

AIO is capable to give continuous estimation for the states of a continuous nonlinear system by using the output of the system just at discrete impulse times. This is very significant in applications when establishing a continuous link (couple) between system (drive) and observer (response) is impossible. Also, the AIO estimates both states and unknown parameters of the uncertain system while its computational expense is relatively small in comparison with most conventional observers. Through a new theorem asymptotic convergence of the state estimation error is proved and an upper bound on the maximum possible impulse interval is given. The AIO design routine is simplified by modifying conditions of the proposed theorem to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Because of these advantages, the AIO is used through a chaotic systems observer-based synchronization scheme. Simulation results confirm the proficiency of the AIO even when the coupling signal is scalar.

Creating polymer templates and their use in the in-situ synthesis of biodegradable composite networks	POLYMER												A biodegradable polyethyleneoxide polycaprolactone polyethyleneoxide (PEO-PCL-PEO-or PECE) triblock polymer was synthesized as a structure-directing agent for high-surface area silica formation. Systematic end-group functionalization of the triblock polymer, prior to its use as a structure-directing agent for high-surface area silica growth, imparts an additional reactive function that is exploited to grow a continuous organic phase within and around the silica particles. Hence, the biodegradable triblock also acts as a macromer whose dual function leads to in-situ generation of intimately mixed biopolymer/nanoporous-silica composite networks. This composite can be both biodegradable and biocompatible, and the modulus is comparable to other non-biodegradable materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A discrete fracture network approach for the design of rock foundation anchorage	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF MINING AND METALLURGY SECTION A-MINING TECHNOLOGY												A major consideration in the design of high-capacity tiedown anchors for dams, bridges and tower foundations includes the tensile resistance of the rock mass to pullout typically as a result of overturning moments or hydrostatic uplift. Rock mass pullout capacity for installed anchors is developed from the tensile strength and fracture propagation properties of intact rock, the orientation and physical properties of the discontinuities and anchor confinement at depth. The typically assumed but conservative design approach is to assume that only the dead weight of a uniformly shaped inverted 'rock pull out cone' provides resistance to anchor pullout with an assumed initiation point and breakout angle. It is appreciated that the 'dead weight' cone assumption may be valid if the discontinuities are continuous and the geometry allows for a discrete block to form in the area of anchorage. However, if these persistent joints are not ubiquitously developed this failure mechanism may not represent the conditions across a foundation and can lead to a very conservative anchor designs. A less conservative approach is to consider the deadweight and the tensile strength across the surface area of the assumed pullout cones. Strength estimates are often estimated by a designer using correlations based on the Hoek-Brown failure criteria or the Barton Q-system. However, fundamental assumption of these empirical methods is that the discontinuities are sufficiently closely spaced such that the rock mass can be considered homogenous and isotropic - and this often not the case (Hoek, Carter and Diederichs 2013). In reality, at the scale of many rock anchor pullout problems, the strength and deformation properties of the rock mass are anisotropic, controlled by a few persistent discontinuities and small 'rock bridges' that exist between naturally occurring joints. To accommodate scale effects and the variability of jointing, this paper introduces a reliability-based design (RBD) approach for anchors that uses discrete fracture networks (DFNs) combined with numerical models. With this approach, limitations of the current practice for anchor design are addressed and opportunities are identified to optimise rock anchor designs provided that sufficient information is available to produce a representative DFN. Typically, this requires geological mapping to characterise the rock mass and verify the conditions at discrete anchor locations and in situ anchor testing can be carried out during construction.

The sampled-data system consists of a deterministic, linear, time-invariant, continuous-time plant and a stochastic, linear, time-invariant, discrete-time, jump linear controller. The jump linear controller models computer systems and communication networks that are subject to stochastic upsets or disruptions. This sampled-data model has been used in the analysis and design of fault-tolerant systems and computer-control systems with random communication delays without taking into account the inter-sample response. This paper shows that the known equivalence between the stability of a deterministic sampled-data. system and the associated discrete-time representation holds even in a stochastic framework.

J	Li, JY; Wang, ZD; Lu, RQ; Xu, Y				Li, Jun-Yi; Wang, Zidong; Lu, Renquan; Xu, Yong			A component-based coding-decoding approach to set-membership filtering for time-varying systems under constrained bit rate	AUTOMATICA												This paper is concerned with the set-membership filtering (SMF) problem for a class of discrete time -varying systems with unknown-but-bounded noises under bit rate constraints. The communication between sensor nodes and filters is implemented through a wireless digital communication network with limited bandwidth. A bit rate constraint is first established to quantify the extent to which the network is constrained. A component-based coding-decoding procedure is proposed that enables individual decoder to decode messages from different components scattering in different physical locations. Based on this procedure, a decoded-measurement-based recursive SMF scheme with a prediction-correction structure is put forward. The desired parameters of the set-membership filter can be calculated recursively by the proposed recursive SMF scheme. Furthermore, the co-design issue of the bit rate allocation protocol and the filter gain is converted into the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem that is solved by means of the particle swarm optimization and the recursive filtering algorithms. Finally, numerical simulations on two scenarios are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SMF approach.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jin, S; Roy, S				Jin, Sian; Roy, Sumit			FMCW Radar Network: Multiple Access and Interference Mitigation	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING												With the increasing proliferation of radars on vehicles, interference among vehicular radars is becoming a serious issue. In this work, we consider a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar network with coherent radar interference where all radars adopt the same chirp slopes. Four asynchronous non-cooperative media access control (MAC) protocols are used for mutual radar interference mitigation. We propose two cross-layer performance metrics - multiple access capacity and probability of target misdetection to quantify the network performance under each MAC protocol. Based on our analysis and extensive simulations, we find the pure random access achieves a very poor trade-off between multiple access capacity and probability of target misdetection. However, such a trade-off can be significantly improved by frequency hopping and phase coding. This shows that proper MAC protocols can achieve very good performance even without synchronization and coordination. We describe new insights behind such gains that can be valuable for FMCW radar MAC design.
