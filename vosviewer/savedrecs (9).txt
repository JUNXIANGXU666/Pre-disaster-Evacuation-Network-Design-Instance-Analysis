The network-induced delay is considered, and its distribution characteristic is described by a Bernoulli stochastic variable. A novel event-triggered control scheme is proposed in order to save the limited network communication bandwidth. Based on the Lyapunov-Kravoskii stability theory, a delay-distribution-dependent criterion is derived which guarantees the closed-loop networked discrete-time nonlinear singular system is regular, causal, and stable with a certain H-infinity performance index. A co-design method for the H-infinity controller and the event-triggered scheme is presented by using the singular value decomposition technology. An numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a novel approach for designing a discrete-time sliding mode controller using Thiran's delay approximation is presented considering the real time networked medium and packet loss situation. Thiran's delay approximation technique is used to compensate the controller to actuator fractional delay as well as sensor to controller fractional delay in the sliding surface. Further, the stability condition for the closed loop system with proposed controller is derived using Lyapunov function. The efficacy of the proposed strategy is endowed by simulation results that are conceded in the presence of CAN and Switched Ethernet communication medium.

Then, we further develop the adaptive distributed observer for the discrete-time leader system over jointly connected switching networks, which has the advantage over the distributed observer in that, it does not require that every follower subsystem know the system matrix of the leader system.

The renewable energy is fully exploited under the uncertainty of renewable generation and load demand. The DRL agent learns an optimal policy from history renewable and load data of previous days, where the policy can generate real-time decisions based on observations of past renewable and load data of previous hours collected by connected sensors. The goal is to reduce operating cost on the premise of ensuring supply-demand balance. In specific, a novel finite-horizon partial observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model is conceived considering the spinning reserve. In order to overcome the challenge of discrete-continuous hybrid action space due to the binary DG switching decision and continuous energy dispatch (ED) decision, a DRL algorithm, namely, the hybrid action finite-horizon RDPG (HAFH-RDPG), is proposed. HAFH-RDPG seamlessly integrates two classical DRL algorithms, i.e., deep Q-network (DQN) and recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG), based on a finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data in an IoT-driven MG to evaluate the capability of the proposed algorithm in handling the uncertainty due to interhour and interday power fluctuation and to compare its performance with those of the benchmark algorithms.

Timetabling optimization is significantly complicated by two factors. First, it exhibits strong interdependencies with subsequent fleet assignment decisions of the airlines. Second, flights' departure and arrival times are important determinants of passenger connection opportunities, of the attractiveness of each (nonstop or connecting) itinerary, and, in turn, of passengers' booking decisions. Because of these complicating factors, most existing approaches rely on incremental timetabling. This paper introduces an original integrated optimization approach to comprehensive flight timetabling and fleet assignment under endogenous passenger choice. Passenger choice is captured by a discrete-choice generalized attraction model. The resulting optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. This paper also proposes an original multiphase solution approach, which effectively combines several heuristics, to optimize the network-wide timetable of a major airline within a realistic computational budget. Using case study data from Alaska Airlines, computational results suggest that the combination of this paper's model formulation and solution approaches can result in significant profit improvements as compared with the most advanced incremental approaches to flight timetabling. Additional computational experiments based on several extensions also demonstrate the benefits of this modeling and computational framework to support various types of strategic airline decision making in the context of frequency planning, revenue management, and postmerger integration.

The method considers the teletraffic from the network viewpoint. The traffic estimation is based on the geographic traffic model, which obeys the geographical and demographical factors for the demand for mobile communication services. For the spatial teletraffic characterization, a novel representation technique Is introduced which uses the notion of discrete demand nodes. We show how the information in geographical information systems can be used to estimate the teletraffic demand in an early phase of the network design process. Additionally, we outline how the discrete demand node representation facilitates the application of demand-based automatic mobile network design algorithms.

Most of the processes for industrial mAb production rely on fed-batch operations, resulting in significant downtime. Transitioning to fully continuous and integrated processes holds the potential to boost product yield, enhance quality, and reduce storage costs for intermediate products. The integrated continuous mAb production process can be divided into the upstream and downstream processes. One crucial aspect that ensures the continuity of the integrated process is the switching of the capture columns, which are typically chromatography columns operated in a fed-batch manner downstream. Due to the discrete nature of the switching operation, advanced process control algorithms such as economic MPC (EMPC) are computationally difficult to implement. This is because an integer nonlinear program (INLP) needs to be solved online at each sampling time.This paper introduces two computationally-efficient approaches for EMPC implementation, namely, a sigmoid function approximation approach and a rectified linear unit (ReLU) approximation approach. It also explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). These three methods are compared to the traditional switching approach which is based on a 1 % product breakthrough rule and which involves no optimization.(c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

J	Anand, M; Kumar, PR				Anand, M.; Kumar, P. R.			A Digital Interface for Gaussian Relay and Interference Networks: Lifting Codes From the Discrete Superposition Model	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY												For every Gaussian network, there exists a corresponding deterministic network called the discrete superposition network [1]. We show that this discrete superposition network provides a near-optimal digital interface for operating a class consisting of many Gaussian networks in the sense that any code for the discrete superposition network can be naturally lifted to a corresponding code for the Gaussian network, while achieving a rate that is no more than a constant number of bits lesser than the rate it achieves for the discrete superposition network. This constant depends only on the number of nodes in the network and not on the channel gains or SNR. Moreover the capacities of the two networks are within a constant of each other, again independent of channel gains and SNR. We show that the class of Gaussian networks for which this interface property holds includes relay networks with a single source-destination pair, interference networks, multicast networks, and the counterparts of these networks with multiple transmit and receive antennas. The code for the Gaussian relay network can be obtained from any code for the discrete superposition network simply by pruning it. This lifting scheme establishes that the superposition model can indeed potentially serve as a strong surrogate for designing codes for Gaussian relay networks. We present similar results for the Gaussian interference network, MIMO Gaussian interference networks, MIMO Gaussian relay networks, and multicast networks, with the constant gap depending additionally on the number of antennas in case of MIMO networks.																			0018-9448					MAY	2011	57	5					2548	2564		10.1109/TIT.2011.2120070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2120070													WOS:000289836300002

Reliability-based topology optimization for offshore wind farm collection system	WIND ENERGY												An optimization framework for global optimization of the cable layout topology for offshore wind farm (OWF) is presented. The framework designs and compares closed-loop and radial layouts for the collection system of OWFs. For the former, a two-stage stochastic optimization program based on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed, while for the latter, a hop-indexed full binary model is used. The purpose of the framework is to provide a common base for assessing both designs economically, using the same underlying contingency treatment. A discrete Markov model is implemented for calculating the cable failure probability, useful for estimating the time under contingency for multiple power generation scenarios. The objective function supports simultaneous optimization of (i) initial investment (network topology and cable sizing), (ii) total electrical power loss costs and (iii) operation costs due to energy curtailment from cable failures. Constraints are added accounting for common engineering aspects. The applicability of the full method is demonstrated by tackling three differently sized real-world OWFs. Results show that (i) the profitability of either topology type depends strongly on the project size and wind turbine rating. Closed loop may be a competitive solution for large-scale projects where large amounts of energy are potentially curtailed. (ii) The stochastic model presents low tractability to tackle large-scale instances, increasing the required computing time and memory resources. (iii) Strategies must be adopted in order to apply stochastic optimization for modern OWFs, intending analytically or numerically simplification of mathematical models.

Existing works mainly focus on studying the charging utility maximization problem, that is, they aim to supply as much power as possible to all sensor nodes with a certain number of wireless chargers. However, these works ignore the task performing function of sensor nodes, supplying more power to sensor nodes cannot guarantee that tasks can be performed better. In this paper, therefore, we consider a more practical issue of deploying wireless chargers, where our objective is to maximize the total achieved task utility with a limited deployment cost budget. We formulate our problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming problem, and prove its NP-Hardness. To address this problem, we split it into two sub-problems, where the first sub-problem is about power allocation for sensor nodes, and the second sub-problem is about optimal wireless charger placement. We design an approximation algorithm for each sub-problem, and give theoretical analyses of our algorithms. By solving the two sub-problems accordingly, we get a feasible solution that has a 1/2 (1 - 1/e) performance guarantee for the original problem. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to validate the performance of our algorithms. The results show that our designs significantly outperform the baseline algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms.

Such identification consists of two major steps: behavior learning using a specially designed neural network and extraction of a DEVS model from the learned neural network. This paper presents a method for extracting a DEVS model from one such neural network called CRNN (compound recurrent neural network), which is trained using observed input/output events of an unknown DES. The DES to be identified is restricted to a subclass of DES in which any unknown state can be determined by a finite number of input/output sequences. Identification experiments were performed with three types of unknown DESs, the result of which verified the validity of the proposed model extraction method.

Indeed, purely qualitative and purely quantitative studies display limitations. The purpose of this study is to provide methodological insights by suggesting that mixed methods can be suitably used, depending on the specific research questions. Design/methodology/approach The study consists of an analysis and critical discussion of the methods used in a number of papers leveraging social network approaches to study social networks in tourism and hospitality. The authors describe the benefits and limitations of each method studies considered are examined based on a number of aspects. Findings More than half of the studies classified as network studies adopt quantitative designs and quantitative methods including statistical analyses and observational data. Mixed methods study is a minority and they are almost never labeled as mixed methods. A relevant portion of qualitative studies increasingly embeds a number of rudimentary statistical analyses. With an example, the authors also discuss that purely quantitative or purely qualitative methods can lead to discrepant results, and thus, the authors encourage scholars to embrace mixed method research designs such as explanatory or exploratory sequential designs. Advanced researchers might attempt in the future to embrace transformative, embedded or multiphase mixed methods. Research limitations/implications - This study is based on academic papers and research published before 2019. A rich research agenda is designed. Originality/value This study contributes to explore the way social networks have been dealt with in tourism and hospitality research so far, by advancing a proposal to adopt mixed methods in the form of explanatory or exploratory sequential designs. To the best of the knowledge, it is the first study addressing methodological pitfalls in extant network-based research within the tourism and hospitality domain.

In this paper, an extrusion equipment with gradually narrowed flow channel was designed for continuous preparation of conductive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites via spatial confining forced network assembly (SCFNA) method. By changing processing parameters, the dispersion and aggregation status of short carbon fibers (SCFs) can finally reach a stable state and form conductive networks with different qualities. Besides, we furtherly developed an online monitoring and detection method via image analysis technique to evaluate the completion degree of these conductive networks.

Thus, it has great potentials to be used in healthy lighting, high resolution displays, plant lighting with higher color rendering index close to sunlight and higher color fidelity index. The spectral power distribution (SPD) of light source, representing its light quality, is always dynamically controlled by complex electrical and thermal loadings when the light source operates under usage conditions. Therefore, a dynamic prediction of SPD for the full-spectrum white LED has become a hot but challenging research topic in the high quality lighting design and application. This paper proposes a dynamic SPD prediction method for the full-spectrum white LED by integrating the SPD decomposition approach with the artificial neural network (ANN) based machine learning method. Firstly, the continuous SPDs of a full-spectrum white LED driven by an electrical-thermal loading matrix are discretized by the multi-peak fitting with Gaussian model as the relevant spectral characteristic parameters. Then, the Back Propagation (BP) and Genetic Algorithm-Back Propagation (GA-BP) NNs are proposed to predict the spectral characteristic parameters of LEDs operated under any usage conditions. Finally, the dynamically predicted spectral characteristic parameters are used to reconstruct the SPDs. The results show that: (1) The spectral characteristic parameters obtained by fitting with the Gaussian model can be used to represent the emission lights from multiple chips and phosphors in a full-spectrum white LED; (2) The prediction errors of both BP NN and GA-BP NN can be controlled at low level, that is to say, our proposed method can achieve a highly accurate SPD dynamic prediction for the full-spectrum white LED when it operates under different operation mission profiles.					yutong, li/GRF-2883-2022; li, fei/JYP-3334-2024; Fryc, Irena/S-6171-2018	yutong, li/0000-0002-7866-9367; Fryc, Irena/0000-0002-1381-253X; Fan, Xuejun/0000-0003-0525-4424; Qian, Cheng/0000-0002-5413-8908													1943-0655	1943-0647				FEB	2020	12	1							8200218	10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2962818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2962818													WOS:000511172600001

In such networks, wavelength channels of the optical paths can have a variety of capacities (10/40/100 Gbps). It has been shown that this feature enables new paradigms for protection in optical wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) networks. In this paper, we propose to design transparent MLR networks with shared subconnection protection (SSP). SSP in an MLR network, compared with other more classical approaches (dedicated or shared protection), can also address the cost-versus-capacity trade-off in providing shared protection in a transparent network. The design problem is solved by a two-step approach that formulates part of the problem as an integer linear program (ILP). Our results show that SSP enables higher sharing of backup capacity in an MLR network in that the design cost is up to 37% less than a single-line-rate network with SSP and around 40% less than MLR with dedicated protection.

Unfortunately, for complex systems and networks this design stage can be as important as difficult. In fact, classical analytical methods can become too complicated, inefficient or even inappropriate when determining reliability and availability of non-trivial systems. For that reason, we have developed simulation-based algorithms, which have been implemented as C/C++ programs, to perform these tasks. A procedure to obtain all minimal paths connecting a set of nodes in a network is also presented. Finally, a case-study regarding a Wide Area Network (WAN) that connects several Local Area Networks (LANs) is introduced and analyzed using these algorithms and procedure.

The input data-set needed by the algorithm is composed of gradation of the mix, bulk specific gravity of aggregates, low- and high-performance grade of the binder, binder content of the mix and the target number of gyrations (i.e. N-ini, N-des and N-max). The proposed ANN model uses a three-layer scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation (feed-forward) network. The ANN was trained using data obtained from numerous roads with a total of 1817 different mix designs. Results revealed that the ANN was able to predict V-a within V-a (measured) +/- 1.0% range 85-93% of the time and within V-a (measured) +/- 0.5% range 60-70% of the time. Currently with the developed ANN model, Superpave mix design can take approximately between 1.5 and 4.5 days, which corresponds to 3-6 days of savings.

Here, a large-area two-dimensional conjugated-polymer-framework is grown with regular pore distribution, enabling 99.5% salt rejection by forward osmosis. The development of membranes that block solutes while allowing rapid water transport is of great importance. The microstructure of the membrane needs to be rationally designed at the molecular level to achieve precise molecular sieving and high water flux simultaneously. We report the design and fabrication of ultrathin, ordered conjugated-polymer-framework (CPF) films with thicknesses down to 1 nm via chemical vapour deposition and their performance as separation membranes. Our CPF membranes inherently have regular rhombic sub-nanometre (10.3 x 3.7 angstrom) channels, unlike membranes made of carbon nanotubes or graphene, whose separation performance depends on the alignment or stacking of materials. The optimized membrane exhibited a high water/NaCl selectivity of similar to 6,900 and water permeance of similar to 112 mol m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), and salt rejection >99.5% in high-salinity mixed-ion separations driven by osmotic pressure. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that water molecules quickly and collectively pass through the membrane by forming a continuous three-dimensional network within the hydrophobic channels. The advent of ordered CPF provides a route towards developing carbon-based membranes for precise molecular separation.

The present mixed-methods study analyzed trajectories of postimplementation MI competence scores and compared postimplementation qualitative interviews among the clinics with the highest levels of provider competency and the lowest levels of competency to further understand mechanisms of successful implementation.Setting:Ten HIV clinics in the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions.Methods:This study used a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. Continuous MI competency data from the parent study were structured with repeated measurements nested within providers nested within 10 sites. A mixed-effects regression model rank ordered the clinics by competence scores. Key stakeholders (N = 77) at the 10 randomized clinics completed a 1-hour qualitative interview at 12-month follow-up (immediately postimplementation). Using the phases of reflexive thematic analysis, interviews from the 3 highest competence clinics and the 3 lowest competence clinics were pragmatically analyzed.Results:Thematic analysis suggested 3 central themes that influenced successful evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation. Organizational culture included the leadership, collective effort, and resources that influenced how the organization at large responded to the implementation intervention. Staff attitudes encapsulated individual providers' mindsets and attitudes about MI and the implementation intervention. EBP integration reflected the perception and use of MI by individuals and the organization as a whole. These themes and their subthemes are interconnected and exerted an influence on each other through the implementation process.Conclusions:Findings suggest additional implementation strategies to improve implementation of EBPs. Such mixed-methods research is critical to understanding the mechanisms of successful implementation of EBP and improving future implementation strategies.

J	Tsai, JF; Lin, MH; Wang, PC				Tsai, Jung-Fa; Lin, Ming-Hua; Wang, Pei-Chun			An Efficient Deterministic Approach to Optimal Design of Reliable Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY												Reliability and cost are two most important issues in network design optimization that is extensively applied into various optimization problems such as supply chain network design, telecommunication network design, and transportation engineering. This paper proposes an efficient deterministic optimization approach for solving the problem of designing a reliable network. The problem discussed in this paper considers the minimization of the total cost subject to demand, flow balance, and capacity constraints while simultaneously employing mitigation resources to reduce the risk of network failures. Such a problem is typically formulated as a nonconvex mixed-integer program that cannot be easily solved to obtain a global optimum. The proposed optimization method transforms the original nonconvex program into a mixed-integer linear program by linearization techniques and is thus guaranteed to reach a global optimum. In addition, an extended model of minimizing the total weighted loss subject to resource constraints is discussed and globally solved by the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively solves the reliable network design problem with the minimal total cost or the minimal total weighted loss under an appropriate allocation of mitigation resources.																			0018-9529	1558-1721				JUN	2018	67	2					598	608		10.1109/TR.2018.2821669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TR.2018.2821669													WOS:000433911000013

The main result of the paper shows that under some small gain theorem-type conditions, a network of symbolic models can be constructed which approximates a network of incrementally stable control systems in the sense of approximate bisimulation with any desired accuracy. Compositional design of quantization parameters of the symbolic models is also derived and based on the topological properties of the network.

The communication constraint and no prior knowledge of the leader's dynamics cause a challenging task about the observer design. To this end, an adaptive critic design-based distributed optimal observer is developed via the actor-critic framework. The critic network is employed to approximate the cost function. The action network produces the optimal correction policy of the observer. Through convergence analysis, the overall estimation error and the weight estimation errors of the critic network and the action network are demonstrated to be all uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the developed observer.					chen, xin/AFS-7186-2022	Chen, Xin/0000-0001-9924-6833; Wu, Min/0000-0002-0668-8315													2168-2216	2168-2232				NOV	2021	51	11					6976	6985		10.1109/TSMC.2019.2962088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2019.2962088													WOS:000707443800041

Mixed Precision Quantization is a process of assigning different precision to different Neural Network layers for optimized inference. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a process of automatically designing the neural network for a task and can also be extended to search for the precision of each weight and activation matrix. In this paper, we develop the following three methods: (i) Fast Differentiable Hardware-aware Mixed Precision Quantization Search method to find optimal precision, (ii) Joint Differentiable hardware-aware Architecture and Mixed Precision Quantization Co-search, (iii) Joint Accelerator, Architecture, and Precision triple co-search to find best possibilities in all the three worlds.

Impact of an incomplete solute mixing model on sensor network design	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												Incomplete mixing models have recently been shown to better represent solute transport at junctions of pressurized water systems, compared to a complete mixing assumption. The present work incorporated an incomplete solute mixing model into a methodology for sensor network design. Water quality simulations conducted using both mixing models were carried out to generate pollution matrices that provided the input data for the set covering optimization formulation. Multiple contamination and detection scenarios were simulated by considering both a minimum hazard level of the contaminant and a maximum volume of contaminated water consumed. Examination and comparison of outcomes demonstrated that the water quality solver used may impact sensor network designs in three ways by altering: (i) the minimum number of monitoring stations required for full detection coverage, (ii) the optimal layout of stations over the water network and (iii) the detection domain of some stations.

This optimization was conducted because there is no clear method of designing concrete mixture composition and for the purpose of shortening procedure of the trial mix design of concrete. Mix design depend on many variables and deterministic models cannot give good results. The goal of the research was to make a model of a neural network, on the set of available data from 288 trial mix, which would, with highest accuracy, predict the compressive strength of concrete at the age of 28 days. In order to attain as high accuracy of obtained results as possible, three levels of input data to the neural networks were considered. On each of the applied groups of input data, the neural networks with 1 and 2 hidden layers were formed. On the basis of the adopted neural network, an algorithm for usage of the network in actual situations was made, applied on an actual model.

The methodology used for processing the scientific literature was content analysis, using the google scholar search engine. The main keywords used were RL and PW. This article is divided into two parts: the first part discusses the development of circular economy models and RL networks and raises the conceptual framework of the research, and the second part presents mathematical models and exploratory studies, proposed as a solution for RL problems of PW. Articles published between years 2014 and 2019 were reviewed. In total, 102 references were used, 70 of them are part of the literature review. According to our findings, we can state that the most widely used solution method for mathematical modeling is mixed-integer linear programming, and for exploratory studies, it was evaluations. About 93% of studies evaluated raw materials related to PW; only 13% of studies had models with stochastic processes; and 88% of the investigations used continuous variables, being the multiobjective functions one of the most used to provide solutions to RL problems. Regarding the mathematical models, 49% were evaluations, 9% corresponded to multicriteria analysis, 29% to linear and nonlinear programming, and 4% to another type of evaluation or model.

It allows the autonomous adjustment of levels of autonomy (LOA) and the human-robot collaboration modes according to the task requirements as well as the states of environments, robots and the human operator. However, it is still difficult for humans and robots to understand each other's intentions and motivations due to the challenges of cognition representation and behavior reasoning In this paper, we propose a novel mixed-initiative MUT approach using coactive design and graph neural networks (GNN) towards explainable human-robot collaboration. First, an interdependence analysis table is designed for a specific manned-unmanned aerial vehicle task following the coactive design principles of observability, predictability and directablity. Then, a multi-agent dynamic task assignment system is designed based on a task model with key decision-making points. Finally, we have used the Graph Network Library to design a GNN model for adjusting the LOA among the MAV and UAVs in the given task.

The correlations between connectivism and contextualized learning through a formative experience of the Open Educational Movement was analyzed in order to propose strategies that result in greater perseverance, active participation and retention of less self-motivated students in MOOCs. A mixed method approach was used to survey students, interview students and coordinators, and analyze relevant documents. The findings were classified as (1) Challenges: self-motivation, self-regulation abilities, extra time invested, release requirements, goals and inductive activities before the course opening, unsatisfactory identification of students, difficult activities, feedback monitoring and a platform incompatible with balancing its use with that of social networks; (2) Problems: limited information and communication technology skills, difficult feedback research in forums, uncertain peer feedback when not theory-based or scaffolded by teachers, scarce theoretical support in evidence portfolios and a lack of means to help low self-motivated or self-regulated students; (3) Main contextual obstacles: some students cannot count on their employers' support or continuous technology access, some students basic wellbeing needs are not met, and inability to contextualize learning; (4) Connectivism: students' motivation in the MOOC content and their expanding knowledge networks. Based on these findings, a MOOC design requirement template aimed at supporting students' self-motivation and self-regulation through connectivism is provided.

Design/methodology/approach A field experiment was set up over a period of three months to test the effects of two variants of an advertisement campaign (a social vs a discrete ad) on the modeled networked and discrete ROIs. Findings The authors find that emphasizing discrete user actions leads to lower network gains, but higher monetary returns while the social action emphasis produces higher network gains, but lower monetary returns. The study further suggests that social action focus is preferable for brand promotion and engagement, whereas the discrete action focus is suitable for boosting sales and website traffic. Practical implications Several potential implications for social media researchers and marketers are also discussed. Originality/value The authors for the first time showed that that the social media returns are derived not only from individual actions taken by the user (e.g. likes and shares) but also from users' social interdependencies and the additional exposure that results from network effects.																			1066-2243					APR 6	2020	30	2					631	652		10.1108/INTR-07-2018-0346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/INTR-07-2018-0346													WOS:000534449800012

This graph alignment problem generalizes graph isomorphism and arises in applications from social network analysis to bioinformatics. Some solutions assume that auxiliary information on known matches or node or edge attributes is available, or utilize arbitrary graph features. Such methods fare poorly in the pure form of the problem, in which only graph structures are given. Other proposals translate the problem to one of aligning node embeddings, yet, by doing so, provide only a single-scale view of the graph. In this article, we transfer the shape-analysis concept of functional maps from the continuous to the discrete case, and treat the graph alignment problem as a special case of the problem of finding a mapping between functions on graphs. We present GRASP, a method that first establishes a correspondence between functions derived from Laplacian matrix eigenvectors, which capture multiscale structural characteristics, and then exploits this correspondence to align nodes. We enhance the basic form of GRASP by altering two of its components, namely the embedding method and the assignment procedure it employs, leveraging itsmodular, hence adaptable design. Our experimental study, featuring noise levels higher than anything used in previous studies, shows that the enhanced form of GRASP outperforms scalable state-of-the-art methods for graph alignment across noise levels and graph types, and performs competitively with respect to the best nonscalable ones. We include in our study another modular graph alignment algorithm, CONE, which is also adaptable thanks to its modular nature, and show it can manage graphs with skewed power-law degree distributions.

The chillers and ice CTES equipment are connected in series to cool the chilled water so that large temperature difference and ultra low temperature air supply are realized to achieve small flow for energy saving. This study involves two phases: development of the mathematical model of the plant, development and testing of model predictive control algorithms. A co-simulation environment based on Matlab and TRNSYS is developed. The thermal behavior of the ice tank and plate heat ex-changer is analyzed by lumped formulas of the conservation equations in Matlab while models of other equipment such as chillers, pumps and cooling towers are developed in TRNSYS. The ice CTES system is modeled as a hybrid system, where the water phase transitions (solid-melting-liquid) are described by combining continuous and discrete dynamics. The model predictive control algorithm is designed and developed in Matlab to determine the required ice tank outlet water temperature to minimize operating expenses while meeting equipment and thermal comfort constraints under varying loads. The controller is optimized based on a forward neural network dynamic optimization algorithm. The objective function is a constant coefficient quadratic cost function of the ice tank outlet water temperature response and the use of control effort. This paper validates and compares the advantages of the MPC over PID. The findings illustrate that the MPC achieves shorter regulation time and smaller overshoot when compared with PID.

To exploit the cloud-like functions at the network edge, service caching has been implemented to reuse the computation task input/output data, thus effectively reducing the delay incurred by data retransmissions and repeated execution of the same task. In a multiuser cache-assisted MEC system, users' preferences for different types of services, possibly dependent on their locations, play an important role in the joint design of communication, computation, and service caching. In this article, we consider multiple representative locations, where users at the same location share the same preference profile for a given set of services. Specifically, by exploiting the location-aware users' preference profiles, we propose joint optimization of the binary cache placement, the edge computation resource, and the bandwidth (BW) allocation to minimize the expected sum-energy consumption, subject to the BW and the computation limitations as well as the service latency constraints. To effectively solve the mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based offline cache placement scheme using a novel stochastic quantization-based discrete-action generation method. The proposed hybrid learning framework advocates both benefits from the model-free DL approach and the model-based optimization. The simulations verify that the proposed DL-based scheme saves roughly 33% and 6.69% of energy consumption compared with the greedy caching and the popular caching, respectively, while achieving up to 99.01% of the optimal performance.

The time-varying ATM network system is depicted by using a discrete-time linear model with mismatched uncertainties and time delays. An asymptotically stable sliding mode surface is designed by using linear matrix inequality (LMI). Based on the improved discrete time reaching law, the controller can effectively constrain the oscillation of allowed cell rate (ACR) and the queue length in router.

Finite-time sliding mode flow control design via reduced model for a connection-oriented communication network	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												This paper addresses the flow control design of a connection-oriented communication network from the robust control theory perspective. Network is modelled as a nth order discrete system whose first order model is obtained using the two-time scale property associated with the process. The proposed scheme is characterised by-an-equivalent control based discrete sliding mode design for the first order model which is applied to nth order systems through aggregation. Besides its design simplicity, the proposed method exhibits finite time convergence property for the states while applied to the full order system emulating the characteristics of terminal sliding mode in a certain way.

Fortunately, the continuous improvement in urban multimodal transportation networks provides more possibilities for alleviating the operation pressure of a single transportation system. To tackle this issue, this study proposes a novel metro passenger flow control strategy that integrates shuttle buses to ensure normal passenger travel. Specifically, this study aims to discover an effective way to integrate the scheduling problems of metro systems and shuttle bus systems into an optimization model, where the optimization problem in metro systems considers train timetabling, rolling stock circulation, and passenger flow control strategy, while that in shuttle bus systems consider bus timetabling, vehicle utilization, short -turn and flexible limited -stop strategies. These two types of systems are coupled via passengers affected by the flow control measure of metro systems, thereby achieving a joint optimization. Using linearization techniques, we formulate a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to alleviate passenger dissatisfaction while simultaneously decreasing system operating costs. Based on the historical time -varying data of Beijing Metro Batong Line, a series of numerical experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that the joint optimization schedule can effectively alleviate congestion in the metro system during morning peak hours, ensuring operation safety and improving service levels.																			0360-8352	1879-0550				MAR	2024	189								109980	10.1016/j.cie.2024.109980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2024.109980		FEB 2024											WOS:001195242200001
J	Lu, MB				Lu, Maobin			A Sensory Feedback Based Discrete Distributed Observer to Cooperative Output Regulation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												The discrete distributed observer is developed recently to solve the cooperative output regulation problem. The validation of the existing discrete distributed observer depends on the establishment of the communication network. In some practical applications, only the sensor network can be established among all agents. To handle such cases, we propose a sensory feedback-based discrete distributed observer, which depends on the relative output of neighboring agents. In contrast to existing results, the design of the discrete distributed observer and cooperative output regulation analysis should be conducted simultaneously. Resorting to the small-gain theorem, we develop a small-gain condition-based approach and a low-gain-based approach, respectively. By these two approaches, we demonstrate that the discrete distributed observer holds and the cooperative output regulation problem of heterogeneous discrete-time linear multiagent systems can be solved.																			0018-9286	1558-2523				SEP	2022	67	9					4762	4769		10.1109/TAC.2022.3162545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2022.3162545													WOS:000848246200031

Mixed-line-rate (MLR) optical networks offer a transitional solution that allows several coexisting line rates (e.g., 10/40/100 Gb/s). In this paper, we investigate distance-adaptive preconfigured-cycle (p-Cycle) protection scheme in MLR optical networks. Path-lengthlimited p-cycles are designed to be assigned line rate depending on the length of each protection path. Instead of conventional candidate cycle enumeration, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to directly generate the optimal p-cycles with the minimum capital expenditures (CAPEX) cost. We also develop two algorithms to make the proposed MILP model scalable. Simulation results indicate that the algorithms are time efficient for solving the MILP-based p-cycle design. We further compare our p-cycle design method with other schemes, and demonstrate that our method largely reduces the CAPEX cost for more than 40%, mainly in transponder cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that distance-adaptive p-cycle design without candidate cycle enumeration is proposed for MLR optical networks.

Experimental data sets include the content of water, cementitious materials (cement, silica fume, rice husk ash, and natural pozzolanas), coarse and fine aggregates, superplasticizer and the compressive strength, the slump, and the maximum size of the aggregates. Also, statistical analyses are used to correlate the results and the acceptable error. Then, the neural network is retrained using experimental data sets together with analytical data sets that are produced using the Iranian national concrete mix design method, empirical relationships, or both. Finally, the performance of the retrained neural networks is compared with the first one.

Adaptive Recurrent Neural Network Enhanced Variable Structure Control for Nonlinear Discrete Mimo Systems	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												The stability and performance of robust control for a nonlinear complex dynamic system deteriorates due to large uncertainties. To address this, a discrete variable structure control (DVSC) outside of a convex set is designed to force the operating point into a convergent set, which is verified by Lyapunov stability theory. Due to the dynamic features of the lumped uncertainties, they are learned on-line by a recurrent neural network (RNN) in a specific convex set containing the convergent set of the DVSC. Between this convergent set and the convex set, a switching mechanism determines whether a learning RNN for the lumped uncertainties is executed. An adaptive recurrent-neural-network enhanced discrete variable structure control is then established to improve both transient and steady performances. Simulations, including compared examples and application to the trajectory tracking of a mobile robot, validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control.

This allows for disease spread models that includes the time-varying contact network and population demographic. However, performing data-driven simulations with a high degree of detail are computationally challenging. We have developed an efficient and flexible discrete-event simulator SimInf for stochastic disease spread modelling that divides work among multiple processors to accelerate the computations. The model integrates disease dynamics as continuous-time Markov chains and livestock data as events. In this study, all Swedish livestock data (births, movements and slaughter) from July 1st 2005 to December 31st 2013 were included in the simulations. Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (VTEC O157) are capable of causing serious illness in humans. Cattle are considered to be the main reservoir of the bacteria. A better understanding of the epidemiology in the cattle population is necessary to be able to design and deploy targeted measures to reduce the VTEC O157 prevalence and, subsequently, human exposure. To explore the spread of VTEC O157 in the entire Swedish cattle population during the period under study, a within-and between-herd disease spread model was used. Real livestock data was incorporated to model demographics of the population. Cattle were moved between herds according to real movement data. The results showed that the spatial pattern in prevalence may be due to regional differences in livestock movements. However, the movements, births and slaughter of cattle could not explain the temporal pattern of VTEC O157 prevalence in cattle, despite their inherently distinct seasonality.

Design, setting, participants, & measurements The Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study (n=1124) was a multicenter trial that randomized critically ill patients requiring initiation of RRT to more intensive (hemodialysis or sustained low-efficiency dialysis six times per week or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration at 35 ml/kg per hour) versus less intensive (hemodialysis or sustained low-efficiency dialysis three times per week or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration at 20 ml/kg per hour) RRT. Mixed linear regression models were fit to estimate the association of RRT intensity with change in daily urine output in survivors through day 7 (n=871); Cox regression models were fit to determine the association of RRT intensity with time to >= 50% decline in urine output in all patients through day 28. Results Mean age of participants was 60 +/- 15 years old, 72% were men, and 30% were diabetic. In unadjusted models, among patients who survived >= 7 days, mean urine output was, on average, 31.7 ml/d higher (95% confidence interval, 8.2 to 55.2 ml/d) for the less intensive group compared with the more intensive group (P=0.01). More intensive RRT was associated with 29% greater unadjusted risk of decline in urine output of >= 50% (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.51). Conclusions More intensive versus less intensive RRT is associated with a greater reduction in urine output during the first 7 days of therapy and a greater risk of developing a decline in urine output of >= 50% in critically ill patients with severe AKI.

Optical technologies have significant promise in improving the energy efficiency of network infrastructures. Future optical backbone networks will be heterogeneous in nature where a single link may carry various line-rate signals. This mixed-line-rate (MLR) network architecture is shown to be cost effective in satisfying heterogeneous traffic demands. In this study, we present mathematical models that can act as references for designing energy-and cost-efficient MLR optical networks. We also perform a comparative study of the energy efficiency of MLR and special cases of MLR design, named as single-line-rate networks (where all the links have same line rates). We explore the scenarios where the MLR networks minimize energy consumption. Finally, we investigate the relationship between energy-minimized and cost-minimized MLR network design.

The analysis includes both a qualitative as well as a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment consists of a literature review of existing studies about EV charging behaviour and an analysis of semi-structured interviews with Danish EV users. This assessment identifies the most relevant factors for charging. In addition, it highlights that the time horizon of the charging decision is an essential factor. We use this to design two stated-choice (SC) experiments explicitly taking these findings into account. The first SC experiment looks into long-term decisions related to regular charging practices. The second SC experiment captures decisions related to occasional charging needs on longer trips. The SC data consist of three responses from 558 EV owners for each of the two experiments. We model the data using mixed logit models to allow for unobserved heterogeneity and the repeated nature of the SC data. The main findings indicate a high preference for all-inclusive/flat fee pricing structures. Moreover, they show that respondents value interoperability between charging networks, both nationally and internationally. Related to occasional charging, we find willingness-to-pay measures describing the detour respondents are willing to drive to obtain lower costs, a higher likelihood of available chargers, and facilities at the charging location. Overall the analyses highlight many factors that influence the charging decisions of consumers that are relevant for policymakers and charging operators. In addition, they highlight the barriers in a charging context, such as network roaming, lack of charging etiquette, and congestion at chargers.					; Thorhauge, Mikkel/L-5711-2016	Jensen, Anders Fjendbo/0000-0002-1952-7617; Mabit, Stefan Eriksen/0000-0002-3675-6884; Thorhauge, Mikkel/0000-0002-1887-7527													0965-8564	1879-2375				NOV	2022	165						120	143		10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.013		SEP 2022											WOS:000865288200002

Various techniques to reduce these energy demands in SRAM, including heterogeneous and hybrid SRAM designs, have been proposed in earlier works. However, these designs still consume significant energy at higher voltage and suffer from area overhead. Considering the aforementioned issue, we propose 7 different homogeneous Mixed-V-T 8T SRAM architectures for neural networks, which overcome these issues. We analyzed the effect of truncation on different neural networks for different datasets and further applied the truncation technique on the SRAM architecture used for ANN. We design the Mixed-V-T 8T SRAM architecture and validate it suitability for 5 different neural networks. Our proposed Mixed-V-T 8T SRAM architecture requires maximum of 0.34x(0.46x) and 0.56x(0.69x) dynamic energy(leakage power) than Het-6T and Hyb-8T/6T SRAM architecture respectively at 0.5V and maximum of 0.7x(0.84x) and 0.92x(0.90x) dynamic energy(leakage power) than Het-6T and Hyb-8T/6T SRAM array respectively at 0.7 V for 6-bit weights of neural networks.																			1063-9667		978-1-6654-8505-0				2022							174	179		10.1109/VLSID2022.2022.00043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VLSID2022.2022.00043													WOS:000861447800031

By means of the knowledge of clusters controls, a clusters synchronous frame of space-time dis-crete switching complex networks with boundary feedback controller is newly proposed and established. With the helps of some indispensable vector-valued sequence inequalities and Lyapunov function with switching signals and clusters' information, the boundary feedback controllers are designed to synchro-nize space-time discrete switching complex networks coupled with nodes' states or spatial diffusions in the form of clusters. Additionally, a realizable computer algorithm is given to make the derived results of this paper easier to enforce. The current work is pioneering in consideration of discrete spatial diffusions and provides a theoretical and practical basis for future research in this regard.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Future extinction risk of wetland plants is higher from individual patch loss than total area reduction	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Quantifying the risk of extinction due to habitat loss is an increasingly urgent task for the design and implementation of effective conservation interventions. Methods based on species- and endemics-area relationships are well developed, but applications to date have concentrated primarily on the fragmentation of formerly continuous habitats such as forests and woodlands. Applying these area-based methods to predict extinction risk in habitat types occurring naturally as spatially discrete patches has been largely ignored. We address this knowledge gap using a network of seasonally connected wetlands. We modelled the risk of extinction associated with native wetland plant communities under two alternative scenarios: the loss of (i) entire wetlands (patch loss) versus (ii) an equivalent area distributed across the wetlands (area loss). Patch-loss scenarios resulted in more than twice the number of species going extinct than the equivalent loss of area. Extinction due to patch loss was highest when wetlands were removed in increasing size order (smallest to largest) a plausible scenario arising from forecast climatic drying in the region. Small wetlands contained >16% of endemic species in only <5% of wetland area, largely explaining this result. Extinction risk associated with naturally occurring habitat patches depends on the distribution of regionally endemic species; where this is not solely a function of habitat area, the loss of small patches can represent higher risk than an equivalent reduction in total habitat area across the network.

An intervention study was designed to evaluate the effects of proactive (a daily telephone call initiated by a member of a breastfeeding support team) and/or reactive (mothers could call the breastfeeding support team) telephone based breastfeeding support for mothers after discharge from the NICU. The mothers in the intervention group had access to both proactive and reactive support; the mothers in the control group only had access to reactive support. The aim of this study was to explore the mothers' experiences of the proactive and reactive telephone support. Methods: This study was a qualitatively driven, mixed-method evaluation using three data sources: questionnaires with qualitative open-ended questions, visual analogue scales and telephone interviews. In total, 365 mothers contributed data for this study. The qualitative data were analysed with an inductive thematic network analysis, while the quantitative data were analysed with Student's t-test and the chi-square test. Results: Proactive support contributed to greater satisfaction and involvement in breastfeeding support. The mothers who received proactive support reported that they felt strengthened, supported and secure, as a result of the continuous care provided by staff who were knowledgeable and experienced (i.e., in breastfeeding and preterm infants), which resulted in the global theme 'Empowered by proactive support'. The mothers who received reactive support experienced contradictory feelings; some felt secure because they had the opportunity to call for support, whereas others found it difficult to decide when and if they should use the service, which resulted in the global theme; 'Duality of reactive support'. Conclusion: There were positive aspects of both proactive (i.e., greater satisfaction and feelings of empowerment) and reactive support (i.e., the opportunity to call for support); however, the provision of reactive support alone may be inadequate for those with the greatest need for support as they are the least likely to access it.

By employing Razumikhin technique and Lyapunov functions, several global exponential stability criteria are established. It is shown that, even if the non-linear discrete delay systems, in the absence of impulses, are unstable, impulses can exponentially stabilise the system with an estimated convergence rate. Moveover, these impulsive stabilisation results can be applied to design impulsive control scheme to achieve exponential synchronisation of discrete dynamical networks with coupling time-delays. Synchronisation criteria are obtained by using some simple forms of Lyapunov functions. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the authors' results.

J	Maass, W; Natschläger, T; Markram, H				Maass, W; Natschläger, T; Markram, H			Real-time computing without stable states:: A new framework for neural computation based on perturbations	NEURAL COMPUTATION												A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.																			0899-7667					NOV	2002	14	11					2531	2560		10.1162/089976602760407955	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089976602760407955								12433288					WOS:000178882900001
J	Srivastava, DK; Awchi, TA				Srivastava, D. K.; Awchi, Taymoor A.			Storage-Yield Evaluation and Operation of Mula Reservoir, India	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												A set of nested models was applied to provide useful strategy to evaluate the storage, water yield and the operational performance of the multipurpose Mula reservoir in India. Insufficient yield from the reservoir for the purpose of water supply and irrigation has led to the need for reevaluation. These nested models were applied in tandem using linear programming (LP), dynamic programming (DP), artificial neural networks (ANN), hedging rules (HRs), and simulation. An LP-based yield model (YM) has been used to reevaluate the annual yields available from the reservoir for water supply and irrigation. The yields obtained from the YM have been refined by two DP models, viz; the controlled output DP (CODP) and the controlled inventory DP (CIDP). The prespecified annual release reliabilities and the yield deficits were similar to that used in the YM. In this approach, the ANN models use a hybrid model in the stochastic generation of monthly inflows to the reservoir for studying its operational performance. With the ANN, both the sigmoidal (DPN) and the radial basis function network (RBN) evaluated reservoir performance using results of the DP model. Continuous HR (CHR) and discrete HR (DHR) were also used for modeling the reservoir performance. The results show that the YM estimates the annual multiyields accurately. The data generated by the hybrid models preserve the characteristics of the historical data. The RBN is better than the DPN models. In the CHR, the sets of hedging trigger obtained from the YM gave an acceptable performance. The DHR reduces the number of reservoir empty conditions and hazards of droughts. The study reveals that the project may fail to fulfill the irrigation demands.

In the machine learning context, the above measure can be achieved by defining a regression problem, which aims at numerical prediction of the dissolved oxygen status. In general, the vast majority of popular machine learning algorithms were designed for undertaking classification tasks. In order to effectively adopt the popular machine learning algorithms fir the above-mentioned numerical prediction, in this paper, we propose a two-stage training approach that involves transforming a regression problem into a classification problem and then transforming it back to regression problem. In particular, unsupervised discretization of continuous attributes is adopted at the first stage to transform the target (numeric) attribute into a discrete (nominal) one with several intervals, such that popular machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the interval to which an instance belongs in the setting of a classification task. Furthermore, based on the classification result at the first stage, some of the instances within the predicted interval are selected for training at the second stage towards numerical prediction of the target attribute value of each instance. An experimental study is conducted to investigate in general the effectiveness of the popular learning algorithms in the numerical prediction task and also analyze how the increase of the number of training instances (selected at the second training stage) can impact on the final prediction performance. The results show that the adoption of decision tree learning and neural networks lead to better and more stable performance than Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machine.

Vascular assembly and patterning has largely been studied using a reductionist approach where a particular endothelial cell molecular pathway or cellular mechanism is investigated as a relatively closed system. This trend of research has yielded a staggering wealth of genes, proteins, and cells that play critical roles in angiogenesis and some have resulted in successful targeted angiogenic therapies. However, these genes, proteins, and cells do not exist in discrete closed systems, rather they are intimately coupled across spatial and temporal dimensions. Designing experiments to study a single or group of perturbations is fraught with confounding complications. An integrative tool is required that incorporates gene, protein, and cell information and appropriately describes the complex systems behavior of vascular assembly and patterning. In this paper, we propose a new deterministic mathematical formulation to model growth factor-induced angiogenesis. Conductivity, of the extracellular matrix for the movement/extension of capillary sprouts is a new concept introduced to account for the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the extracellular matrix. The replacement of traditional endothelial cell density by the capillary indicator function enhances the capabilities of capturing the capillary network sharply in a fine scale (i.e., tracking the dynamics of the tip in uni-cellular scale). Major mechanisms including cell proliferation, sprout branching, and anastomosis are incorporated directly into this continuous mathematical model and model parameters are perturbed to determine the strength of their effect on angiogenesis. The model is fully deterministic and generates the overall dendritic structure of the capillary network morphologically similar to those observed in vivo. The simulations "capture" significant vascular patterning, such as vascular loops and backward growth. Moreover, the simulations provide a deeper understanding of the influence of extracellular matrix on angiogenesis and vascular patterning. An advantage of this model is that the complex physical, chemical and biological processes in angiogenesis can be described and consequently analyzed by a mathematical system with self-contained information.

This study addresses the challenge of designing a closed-loop supply chain network (CLSCN) under demand uncertainty by integrating forward and reverse logistics. A continuous approximation (CA) approach is proposed to solve a responsive CLSCN model. An inventory-sharing strategy is applied in the continuous approximation (CA) approach to further solve uncertain demand in a CLSCN. We conduct sensitivity analysis to demonstrate how the optimal design characteristics and the responsive supply chain network (SCN) design depend on various scenarios. A responsive CLSCN's network density is higher than a responsive SCN's. The changes in network density of the distribution center (DC) are not significantly affected by increased risks of uncertainties. The proposed model has demonstrated substantial cost savings compared to the traditional responsive CLSCN model.																			0360-8352	1879-0550				JUN	2024	192								110233	10.1016/j.cie.2024.110233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2024.110233													WOS:001246484100001

Then, a forward control based on a nominal system is employed to cancel the system nonlinear matrix gain and track the desired trajectory. A novel recurrent-neural-network (RNN) with a compensation of upper bound of its residue is applied to model the remained uncertainties in a compact subset Omega. The linearly parameterized connection weight for the function approximation error of the proposed network is also derived, An e-modification updating law with projection for weight matrix is employed to guarantee its boundedness and the stability of network without the requirement of persistent excitation. Then a discrete-time multivariable neuro-adaptive variable structure control is designed to improve the system performances. The semi-global (i,e,, for a compact subset Omega) stability of the overall system is then verified by the Lyapunov stability theory, Finally, simulations are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed controller.																			1083-4419	1941-0492				DEC	2000	30	6					865	877											18252417					WOS:000165708400005

Based on the analysis of the control inputs, the dynamics model can be decomposed into the altitude subsystem and the velocity subsystem. Using the first-order Taylor expansion, the altitude subsystem can be transformed into discrete-time model, and then the strict-feedback form can be obtained. The controller is designed via back-stepping method. During this progress, neural networks are employed to approximate the mismatched uncertainties. Neural networks are used on the denominator of the controller as well as on the numerator of the controller to approximate the whole uncertainty (including the nominal value). The dual neural network controller via back-stepping is able to track system instructions accurately. Stability analysis proves that the errors of all the signals in the system are of uniform ultimate bound-ness. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

J	Gazivoda, M; Bilas, V				Gazivoda, Marko; Bilas, Vedran			Always-On Sparse Event Wake-Up Detectors: A Review	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL												Recently there has been a significant increase in demand for wireless sensor networks, as their field of application is rapidly expanding, drivenmostly by the growing importance and prevalence of the Internet of Things concept. To enable practical application of wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes must be inexpensive, small, light-weight, intelligent and autonomous. This paper presents a review of lowpower always-on wake-up detectors used to reduce a sensor node's power consumption and enable continuous detection of sparse events. We describe the wake-up concept, discuss its advantages and present the wake-up detector's power consumption, detection accuracy and false positive rate as parameters of interest. We present a state-of-the-art analysis of wake-up detectors, grouping them based on their power consumption into zero-power and near-zero-power detectors and active detectors, whichwe further separate based on their implementation into digital detectors and mixed-signal and analog detectors. This analysis shows state-of-the-art wake-up detectors operate with detection accuracy over 90% and a wide range of power consumptions, spanning from a few nW to few tens of mu W, because of their diverse applications and sensor modalities. Additionally, it shows that active mixed-signal wake-up detectors are currently the most utilized implementation, with emphasis on acoustic transducermodality. It also shows potential trends for future detector design utilizing more MEMS and NEMS to further lower detector power consumption. We also show techniques and ideas not yet integrated in the wake-up concept, to potentially improve the wake-up detector concept and present the wake-up detectors' common applications and their specifics.

By using the linear matrix inequality method and the free-weighting matrix technique, we construct a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and establish new sufficient conditions to guarantee that the uncertain discrete-time stochastic neural networks with interval time-varying delay are globally exponential stable in the mean square. Furthermore, we extend our consideration to the stabilization problem for a class of discrete-time stochastic neural networks. Based on the state feedback control law, some novel delay-dependent criteria of the robust exponential stabilization for a class of discrete-time stochastic neural networks with interval time-varying delay are established. The controller gains are designed to ensure the global robust exponential stability of the closed-loop systems.

The P-D and intermittent hybrid state feedback controller is designed, such that normalisation and H-infinity stabilisation of DDISs can be realised. A novel impulsive-inputs-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional based on a couple of auxiliary functions is constructed, which is continuous along the system state trajectories with out imposing additional conditions on impulsive dynamics. Improved H-infinity stability criterion is proposed in the form of linear matrix inequalities by utilizing free weighting matrix technique, and the H-infinity stability criterion is described as a single condition based ona combination of discrete and continuous dynamics. Finally, the usefulness of the method set forth in this work is demonstrated by a two-loop circuit network. Note to Practitioners-This work is motivated by realizingnormalized P-D and intermittent hybridH infinity control for delayeddescriptor impulsive systems. In practical engineering, manydynamic systems have to be formulated as descriptor systemswhen modeling, such as circuit systems, vehicle suspensionsystems, and so on. It is worth pointing out that infinite dynamicmodes will occur due to the algebraic constraints in descriptorsystems, and can lead to internal impulsive behavior. At the sametime, these systems are often accompanied by external impulsiveperturbations, such as the sudden failure of a component incircuit systems, etc. The internal and external impulses can causeserious damage to the system performances and stability. Mostof the existing control schemes are not well suited for suchpractical systems. In addition, due to the presence of time-varyingdelays, the delayed dynamic systems can easily collapse and cause significant damages.

This is achieved by dividing the enormous transmission bandwidth of fiber into smaller communication channels. The major problem with WDM network design is to find an optimal path between two end users and allocate an available wavelength to the chosen path for the successful data transmission. Methods: This communication over a WDM network is carried out through lightpaths. The merging of all these lightpaths in an optical network generates a virtual topology which is suitable for the optimal network design to meet the increasing traffic demands. But, this virtual topology design is an NP -hard problem. This paper aims to explore Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) framework to solve this design issue.

As we show, even small instances of this combined design/routing problem are extremely intractable, We describe computational experience with a cutting plane algorithm for this problem.

The discrete quadratic energy function whose local minima correspond to the attractive fixed points of the network is constructed via solving a system of linear inequalities derived from the strict local minimality conditions. The weights and the thresholds are then calculated using this energy function. If the inequality system is infeasible, we conclude that no such asynchronous DHN exists, and extend the method to design a discrete piecewise quadratic energy function, which can be minimized by a generalized version of the conventional DHN, also proposed herein. In spite of its computational complexity, computer simulations indicate that the original method performs better than the conventional design methods in the sense that the memory can store, and provide the attractiveness for almost all memory sets whose cardinality is less than or equal to the dimension of its elements. The overall method, together with its extension, guarantees the storage of an arbitrary collection of memory vectors, which are mutually at least two Hamming distances away from each other, in the resulting network.					guzelis, cuneyt/S-7282-2019; Zurada, Jacek M/B-8687-2013														1045-9227	1941-0093				MAR	2005	16	2					370	378		10.1109/TNN.2004.841775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2004.841775								15787144					WOS:000227407500008

The construction costs of potential links are assumed as random variables and mutually independent with each other. The upper-level model is a chance constrain model with the objective function of minimizing the total travel costs in the network, and the lower-level model is a user equilibrium model. The stochastic model is then transformed into a deterministic one. A branch-and-bound solution algorithm is designed to solve the deterministic model in an efficient way.

For that purpose, we model the networks as discrete time systems with the available bandwidth acting as the disturbance. The proposed control algorithm is designed in such a way that the closed-loop system stability and finite time error convergence are ensured.

This paper developed a continuous multi-scale synergistic modified cement-based material with excellent properties by polymers, whiskers, and fibers. Notably, the polymer network is formed by in-situ polymerization in the hydration process of cement and works in concert with different scales modified substances. Specifically, the effect of in-situ polymerization of acryl-amide monomers (IPAM), calcium carbonate whiskers (CW), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers on mechanical strength is analyzed by response surface methodology, and the optimal mix ratio design is obtained. With the optimized mix ratio, the flexural strength of multi-scale modification samples is increased by more than 135% compared to the neat paste, while the 28d compressive strength is maintained essentially the same, with only a 2.9% reduction. And multi-scale samples' properties are significantly improved compared to single-scale sam-ples. In addition, multi-scale composites' mechanical properties and microstructure are characterized in detail to investigate the incredible performance and the modification mechanism. Three modified materials form a continuous micro-meso-macro multi-scale structure in the cement matrix. Moreover, the interaction between IPAM, CW, and PVA fibers is confirmed. The IPAM can in-situ modify the interfacial structure of fibers and whiskers, strengthen the interrelation between different scales, resulting in exciting enhancements of the cement -based composite's structure and performance. This multi-scale modification strategy provides new ideas and promising applications for preparing high-performance cement-based materials.

While the device characteristics of these composites have been actively investigated, there is limited knowledge concerning the fundamental intracomponent interactions and the modes of molecular structuring. Here, by use of cellulose and poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), it is shown that the chemical and structural makeup of the surfaces of the composite components are critical factors that determine the materials organization at relevant dimensions. AFM, TEM, and GIVVAXS measurements show that when mixed with cellulose nanofibrils, PEDOT:PSS organizes into continuous nanosized beadlike structures with an average diameter of 13 nm on the nanofibrils. In contrast, when PEDOT:PSS is blended with molecular cellulose, a phase-segregated conducting network morphology is reached, with a distinctly relatively lower electric conductivity. These results provide insight into the mechanisms of PEDOT:PSS crystallization and may have significant implications for the design of conducting biopolymer composites for a vast array of applications.

The corresponding superstructure for the synthesis of hydrogen networks with mixed pattern is firstly presented and its mathematical model is proposed accordingly. One literature case is solved and analysed. The optimal results are compared with those for the conventional hydrogen network and the network with pure intermediate hydrogen headers. It indicates that, the network with mixed pattern can reach the minimum hydrogen utility. The total number of connections between units is less than that of the conventional hydrogen network and the network flexibility is enhanced. Compared with the hydrogen network with pure intermediate hydrogen headers, the number of intermediate hydrogen header is reduced from two to one and it will effectively reduce the investment and retrofit costs.					feng, xiao/KIL-4264-2024														1570-7946		978-0-444-64080-2				2017	40A						841	846		10.1016/B978-0-444-63965-3.50142-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63965-3.50142-2													WOS:000417380000142

Non-fragile observer design for discrete-time genetic regulatory networks with randomly occurring uncertainties	PHYSICA SCRIPTA												This paper investigates the problem of non-fragile observer design for a class of discrete-time genetic regulatory networks (DGRNs) with time-varying delays and randomly occurring uncertainties. A non-fragile observer is designed, for estimating the true concentration of mRNAs and proteins from available measurement outputs. One important feature of the results obtained that are reported here is that the parameter uncertainties are assumed to be random and their probabilities of occurrence are known a priori. On the basis of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and using a convex combination technique, a delay-dependent estimation criterion is established for DGRNs in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that can be efficiently solved using any available LMI solver.

The notion or problem decomposition, local solution, and composition used in Tree-clustering for constraint networks is recognizable in a discrete optimization method known as valuation-based systems (VBS). A valuation network is applied to the optimal design of a simple rectangular concrete beam. Valuation-based systems are useful in concrete design optimization because (1) the domains of most of problems are easily represented as discrete sets, and (2) the potential for local representation of the objective function diminishes the combinatorial explosion of feasible configurations frequently encountered with global methods. A separable objective function for a concrete beam, comprised of direct cost functions and design constraints transformed into penalty cost functions is presented. The underlying theory of valuation-based systems is briefly described in the context of the specific valuation network. The subject valuation network is processed and produces identical solutions generated by an exhaustive optimization approach. Valuation-based systems are best applied iv discrete optimization problems in which the objective function can be separated into several functions with significantly smaller domains.																					0-7844-0163-2				1996							154	165																WOS:A1996BG81M00014

Rollercoaster: An Efficient Group-Multicast Scheme for Mix Networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 30TH USENIX SECURITY SYMPOSIUM					30th USENIX Security Symposium	AUG 11-13, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	USENIX Assoc				Mix network designs such as Loopix provide strong metadata anonymity guarantees that are crucial across many applications. However, because they limit the rate at which messages can be sent by each user, they incur high delays when sending many messages to multiple recipients - for instance, in decentralised collaborative apps. In this paper we present an efficient multicast scheme named Rollercoaster that reduces the time for delivering a message to all members of a group of size m from O(m) to O(logm). Rollercoaster can be deployed without modifications to the underlying mix network, allowing it to benefit from the anonymity set provided by existing users. We further develop an extension that achieves the same asymptotic guarantees in the presence of unreliable group members. While the scheme is applicable to many mix network designs, we evaluate it for the Loopix network, which is the most advanced and practical design to date. For this evaluation we developed a network simulator that allows fast, reproducible, and inspectable runs while eliminating external influences.																					978-1-939133-24-3				2021							3433	3450																WOS:000722006803040

To reduce the transmission data size, the output signals are quantified by a logarithmic quantiser. Compared with the existing results, past output measurements are first introduced for packaging and transmission only when the event condition is satisfied.

Design of non-fragile state estimators for discrete time-delayed neural networks with parameter uncertainties	NEUROCOMPUTING												This paper is concerned with the problem of designing a non-fragile state estimator for a class of uncertain discrete-time neural networks with time-delays. The norm-bounded parameter uncertainties enter into all the system matrices, and the network output is of a general type that contains both linear and nonlinear parts. The additive variation of the estimator gain is taken into account that reflects the possible implementation error of the neuron state estimator. The aim of the addressed problem is to design a state estimator such that the estimation performance is non-fragile against the gain variations and also robust against the parameter uncertainties. Sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the existence of the desired non-fragile state estimators by using the Lyapunov stability theory and the explicit expression of the desired estimators is given in terms of the solution to a linear matrix inequality. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The need for an optimum process with less waste generation and economic and environmental appeal has led to several advances in this field. Nowadays, continuous flow microreactors are used to improve mass and photon transfer issues with good results compared to batch reactors. The small dimensions minimize the effects of the Beer-Lambert law, and the flow fields can be precisely known. However, when high throughput production is required, the advantages of this technology derived from its small size may be lost due to the increase in its dimensions. As a result, a more careful design is necessary to fully integrate this technology into the industry. On a design-case basis, improvements can be made to minimize some limitations, such as an efficiently illuminated surface-to-volume ratio in numbering up systems. Ray-tracing simulations can be a solution to this issue. It allows the tracking of photon fate and opens the possibility of improving the configuration of the microdevice to increase the reaction rate. A good mixing in the microchannels is also essential for a more homogeneous light distribution in the medium, despite some other flow-dependent issues, such as the formation of dead zones. CFD can clarify the phenomena occurring in a fluid in movement, and it has been applied for this purpose in several studies. Moreover, the CFD model can be linked to the ray-tracing model by using the photon flux simulations in microchannels as the light input for the chemical kinetics. Therefore, all the coupled phenomena taking place in these devices can be successfully simulated. However, the computational cost is one obstacle that cannot be overlooked in simulation-based design, optimization, and scale-out tasks. It is well understood that the more complex the model, the greater the computational effort required. As a result, we propose a framework in this paper that combines CFD, ray-tracing simulation, and machine learning to reduce the computational cost of complex tasks, allowing smart decisions fast and accurately. Data-driven models are used in machine learning, and results from CFD and optics simulations can be fed into the model to generate the predictions.

Design of Discrete Hopfield Neural Network Using a Single Flux Quantum Circuit	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY												The superconductor single flux quantum (SFQ) logic family has been recognized as a promising candidate to resolve the energy consumption crisis in the post-Moore era, owing to its high switching speed and low power consumption. In the field of machine learning, where technology and computational requirements are growing rapidly (e.g., image recognition and natural language processing), there is great potential for the implementation of SFQ circuits. In this study, we investigate and implement a discrete Hopfield neural network (DHNN) using SFQ circuits. A DHNN is a binary neural network with less information than a standard full precision neural network; it also provides a higher processing speed. It is mainly used for pattern recognition and recovery. We designed the DHNN circuit with two patterns, each with eight elements. The circuit operates at the clock frequency of more than 50 GHz.

Currently, an increasing number of network design methods based on entropy targets are being applied to network design. The discretization of data is a common method of obtaining the probability in calculations of information entropy. To study the application of different discretization methods and different entropy-based methods in the design of rain gauge networks, this paper compares and analyzes 9 design results for rainy season rain gauge networks using three commonly used discretization methods (A1, SC and ST) and three entropy-based network design algorithms (MIMR, HT and HC) from three perspectives: the joint entropy, spatiality, and accuracy of the network, as evaluation indices. The results show that the variation in network information calculated by the A1 and ST methods for rainy season rain gauge data is too large or too small compared to that calculated by the SC method, and also that the MIMR method performs better in terms of spatiality and accuracy than the HC and HT methods. The comparative analysis results provide a reference for the selection of discrete methods and entropy-based objectives in rain gauge network design, and provides a way to explore a more suitable rain gauge network layout scheme.					huang, yan/GWM-4747-2022; Wang, Zejun/KBB-8454-2024; TIAN, YI/KHU-9704-2024; Huang, YQ/JOK-7580-2023															2073-4441				JUL	2019	11	7							1357	10.3390/w11071357	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11071357													WOS:000480632300042

A discretization-based approach for the optimization of the multiperiod blend scheduling problem	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												In this paper, we introduce a new generalized multiperiod scheduling version of the pooling problem to represent time varying blending systems. A general nonconvex MINLP formulation of the problem is presented. The primary difficulties in solving this optimization problem are the presence of bilinear terms, as well as binary decision variables required to impose operational constraints. An illustrative example is presented to provide unique insight into the difficulties faced by conventional MINLP approaches to this problem, specifically in finding feasible solutions. Based on recent work, a new radix-based discretization scheme is developed with which the problem can be reformulated approximately as an MILP, which is incorporated in a heuristic procedure and in two rigorous global optimization methods, and requires much less computational time than existing global optimization solvers. Detailed computational results of each approach are presented on a set of examples, including a comparison with other global optimization solvers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, a hybrid state-feedback controller, which combines a pinning state-feedback controller and an impulsive state-feedback controller, is presented, and the criterion of the bipartite synchronization is derived by applying the average impulsive interval method. Secondly, for the case of the network states not all being measured, a hybrid measurement-feedback controller, which combines a pinning measurement-feedback controller and a pinning impulsive measurement-feedback controller, is proposed. The time-varying Lyapunov function method is utilized to design the hybrid measurement-feedback controller such that the bipartite synchronization is realized.

J	Trimpe, S				Trimpe, Sebastian			Event-based state estimation: an emulation-based approach	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												An event-based state estimation approach for reducing communication in a networked control system is proposed. Multiple distributed sensor agents observe a dynamic process and sporadically transmit their measurements to estimator agents over a shared bus network. Local event-triggering protocols ensure that data is transmitted only when necessary to meet a desired estimation accuracy. The event-based design is shown to emulate the performance of a centralised state observer design up to guaranteed bounds, but with reduced communication. The stability results for state estimation are extended to the distributed control system that results when the local estimates are used for feedback control. Results from numerical simulations and hardware experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing network communication.

Firstly, a class of discrete networked cascade control systems with nonlinear disturbance is considered, the sliding mode control is introduced and the model of the system is established. Based on this model and the Lyapunov functional method, the state feedback primary controller and the sliding mode secondary controller for this system are co-designed. Finally, an example of a thermal power plant is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-design method. The main advantages are that the sliding mode control is introduced into cascade control system (CCS) and the design method of sliding mode controller for this system is proposed for the first time. On the premise of ensuring the stability of the system, it can be driven to the sliding mode surface in a limited time, and remain on the sliding mode surface in all subsequent times. The method can achieve better results and be applied to the corresponding industrial system with networked cascade control structure.

A Phase-Field-Based Approach for Modeling Flow and Geomechanics in Fractured Reservoirs	SPE JOURNAL												Modeling the geomechanical deformations of fracture networks has become an integral part of designing enhanced geothermal systems and recovery mechanisms for unconventional reservoirs. Stress changes in the reservoir can cause variations in the apertures of fractures resulting in large changes in their transmissivities. At the same time, sustained high-injection pressures can induce shear slipping along existing fractures and faults and trigger seismic activity. In this work, we extend the phase-field method to solve for flow and geomechanical deformations in naturally fractured reservoirs. The framework can predict the opening/closure of fractures as well as their shear slipping because of induced stresses and poromechanical effects. The flow through fractures is modeled on spatially nonconforming grids using the enhanced velocity mixed finite element method. The geomechanics equations are discretized using the continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element method. The flow and mechanics equations are decoupled using the fixed stress iterative scheme. The implementation is validated against the analytical solutions of Mandel's problem and Sneddon's benchmark test. Two synthetic examples are presented to illustrate the impact of poroelastic deformations and the accompanying dynamic behavior of fractures on the safety and productivity of subsurface projects.

For the networked control system, available communication channels are usually limited. Moreover, the data received by the actuator may be different from the data sent by the controller and this phenomenon is referred to as data drift: By taking limited channels and data drift into account, a new model for the networked control system is established. Then a new Lyapunov functional is constructed to drive some stability criteria. Based on these stability criteria, a channel utilization-based switched controller is designed to asymptotically stabilize the networked system in the sense of mean-square. The proposed design method can enhance robustness of the networked control system to data drift and external disturbances. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on computational logistics, the MDC-BAP is formulated to be a unique variant of the classical resource-constrained project scheduling problem, and modeled as a mixed-integer programming model. The modeling objective is to minimize the total dwelling time of linerships in ports. To address this, a Dueling Double DQN-based reinforcement learning algorithm is designed for the multi-terminal dynamic and continuous berth allocation problem A series of computational experiments are executed to validate the algorithm's effectiveness and its aptitude for multiple terminal joint operation. Specifically, the Dueling Double DQN algorithm boosts the average solution quality by nearly 3.7%, compared to the classical algorithm such as Proximal Policy Optimization, Deep Q Net and Dueling Deep Q Net also have better results in terms of solution quality when benchmarked against the commercial solver CPLEX. Moreover, the performance advantage escalates as the number of ships increases. In addition, the approach enhances the service level at the terminals and slashes operation costs. On the whole, the Dueling Double DQN algorithm shows marked superiority in tackling complicated and large-scale scheduling problems, and provides an efficient, practical solution to MDC-BAP for port operators.

J	Rao, QH; Zhao, CC; Yi, W				Rao, Qiuhua; Zhao, Chenchen; Yi, Wei			A new mixed-mode phase- field model for crack propagation of brittle rock	JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING												Study on crack propagation process of brittle rock is of most significance for cracking-arrest design and cracking-network optimization in rock engineering. Phase-field model (PFM) has advantages of simplicity and high convergence over the common numerical methods (e.g. finite element method, discrete element method, and particle manifold method) in dealing with three-dimensional and multicrack problems. However, current PFMs are mainly used to simulate mode-I (tensile) crack propagation but difficult to effectively simulate mode-II (shear) crack propagation. In this paper, a new mixed-mode PFM is established to simulate both mode-I and mode-II crack propagation of brittle rock by distinguishing the volumetric elastic strain energy and deviatoric elastic strain energy in the total elastic strain energy and considering the effect of compressive stress on mode-II crack propagation. Numerical solution method of the new mixed-mode PFM is proposed based on the staggered solution method with self-programmed subroutines UMAT and HETVAL of ABAQUS software. Three examples calculated using different PFMs as well as test results are presented for comparison. The results show that compared with the conventional PFM (which only simulates the tensile wing crack but not mode-II crack propagation) and the modified mixed-mode PFM (which has difficulty in simulating the shear anti-wing crack), the new mixed-mode PFM can successfully simulate the whole trajectories of mixed-mode crack propagation (including the tensile wing crack, shear secondary crack, and shear anti-wing crack) and mode-II crack propagation, which are close to the test results. It can be further extended to simulate multicrack propagation of anisotropic rock under multi-field coupling loads. (c) 2023 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Building a Utility-based Liver Allocation Model in Preparation for Continuous Distribution	TRANSPLANTATION DIRECT												Background. The current model for end-stage liver disease-based liver allocation system in the United States prioritizes sickest patients first at the expense of long-term graft survival. In a continuous distribution model, a measure of posttransplant survival will also be included. We aimed to use mathematical optimization to match donors and recipients based on quality to examine the potential impact of an allocation system designed to maximize long-term graft survival. Methods. Cox proportional hazard models using organ procurement and transplantation network data from 2008 to 2012 were used to place donors and waitlist candidates into 5 groups of increasing risk for graft loss (1-lowest to 5-highest). A mixed integer programming optimization model was then used to generate allocation rules that maximized graft survival at 5 and 8 y. Results. Allocation based on mathematical optimization improved 5-y survival by 7.5% (78.2% versus 70.7% in historic cohort) avoiding 2271 graft losses, and 8-y survival by 9% (71.8% versus 62.8%) avoiding 2725 graft losses. Long-term graft survival for recipients within a quality group is highly dependent on donor quality. All candidates in groups 1 and 2 and 43% of group 3 were transplanted, whereas none of the candidates in groups 4 and 5 were transplanted. Conclusions. Long-term graft survival can be improved using a model that allocates livers based on both donor and recipient quality, and the interaction between donor and recipient quality is an important predictor of graft survival. Considerations for incorporation into a continuous distribution model are discussed.

However, the paths formed by grid edges can be longer than the actual shortest paths in the terrain since their headings are artificially constrained. Existing methods can hardly deal with dynamic obstacles. To address this problem, we propose a new algorithm combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Firstly, we apply the MPC algorithm to predict the trajectory of dynamic obstacles. Secondly, the DDPG with continuous action space is designed to provide learning and autonomous decision-making capability for robots. Finally, we introduce the idea of the Artificial Potential Field to set the reward function to improve convergence speed and accuracy. In this paper, Matplotlib is used for simulation experiments. The results show that our method has improved considerably in accuracy by 8.11%-43.20% compared with theother methods, and on the length of the path and turning angle by reducing about 50 units and 340 degrees compared with DeepQ Network (DQN), respectively.

Digital control and sampling period assignment of multiple plants in networked control systems	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												This study investigates the problem of sampling period assignment and design of digital state feedback controllers for systems subject to time-varying sampling periods and uncertain delays. The system is controlled through a communication network, where the sampling period and the network-induced delay are bounded in a known interval. The sampled system is described by a linear parameter-varying discrete-time model obtained by means of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. The proposed discretisation procedure improves the current approaches in the literature and allows the design of controllers that are robust to the delay and depending on the sampling period defined by a scheduling policy in a scenario with concurrent access to the communication network by multiple plants. The gain-scheduled linear quadratic controller is designed by means of linear matrix inequalities. The policy to access the network is dynamic and formulated as an optimisation problem. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency and the validity of the proposed approach.

It is assumed that there is a path between every pair of processes in the network. The control objective is specified by a prefix-closed language that is controllable and observable, but not coobservable. The paper is focused on communication among processes necessary to meet the control objective. As such, process models are left unspecified; it is only required that disabling any of the controllable events do not block communication among processes. Our findings support the idea that in the presence of ideal communication channels, the protocol design for noncoobservable specifications can be reduced to the synthesis of communicating decentralized supervisors, and we propose solutions for a restricted class of problems. The paper is concluded with a positive result for the case where channels are unreliable.																			0018-9286	1558-2523				MAR	2008	53	2					547	559		10.1109/TAC.2007.915173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2007.915173													WOS:000254184600008

For the altitude subsystem, to avoid the causality contradiction, the original system is formulated into a new equivalent prediction model with strict-feedback form from which the virtual control is designed with error feedback and neural approximation via back-stepping. For stability analysis, Lyapunov function is chosen with regard to the novel formulation of new strict-feedback system.

Herein, a new 3D cadmium metal-organic framework (H3O)center dot[Cd(dppa)] (1) was first synthesized using the rigid 4-(3,5-dicarboxylphenyl)picolinic acid (H(3)dppa) as an organic ligand under solvothermal conditions, exhibiting a novel 6,6-connected network and good tolerance to various solvents. After activation, 1 showed good catalytic reactivity and selectivity for the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives, affording solvent-dependent catalytic activity. Then, using the microcrystals of 1 and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as raw materials, 1@PVDF MMMs were successfully prepared by polymer solution casting. Notably, the integration of MOF and PVDF endows the mixed-matrix membrane 1@PVDF with great advantages in terms of more dispersive Lewis acid catalytic sites and recyclability. As expected, 1@PVDF not only displays good catalytic activity comparable to that of activated 1 but also exhibits remarkable recyclability and continuous usability for the production of benzimidazole and alpha- or beta-amino acid derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a Cd-based MOF and MMMs have been applied as a catalyst for the production of a beta-amino acid. The combination of catalytic MOF and PVDF provides a way to simplify the design of a flow reactor and reduce the costs of manufacturing.					xu, jiawen/KGK-4238-2024; xu, jia/GSD-6347-2022; Xu, Jiawen/JEF-5028-2023	Jiang, Yansong/0000-0002-3086-3590													0020-1669	1520-510X				FEB 1	2021	60	3					2087	2096		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c00084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c00084		JAN 2021						33470793					WOS:000617925100088

A comprehensive case study has been performed for plastic-rich fractions that are treated in German dismantling centres. Plastics from TVs, monitors and printers and small household appliances have been characterised extensively. Based on the characterisation results, state-of-the-art treatment technologies have been combined to design an optimised recycling and upgrade process for each input fraction. High-impact polystyrene from TV casings that complies with the European directive on the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) was produced by applying continuous density separation with yields of about 60%. Valuable acrylonitrile butadiene styrene/polycarbonate can be extracted from monitor and printer casings by near-infrared-based sorting. Polyolefins and/or a halogen-free fraction of mixed styrenics can be sorted out by density separation from monitors and printers and small household appliances. Emerging separation technologies are discussed to improve recycling results.

A mixed eventtriggered ISMC scheme with two different trigger parts is developed and the optimal performance of sliding-mode dynamics with input constrains is ensured. By guaranteeing that the system trajectory converges to the sliding-mode surface with removing the input disturbances, a discontinuous part triggering rule is presented together with the existence analysis of a lower trigger interval time bound. Then, the optimal event-triggered control of sliding-mode dynamics is converted into a discounted factorbased H8 constrained control problem under continuous part triggering condition. To solve the event-triggered HJI equation, a critic-only neural network (NN)-based ADP scheme is developed by applying a concurrent learning. The NN weight is updated by analyzing the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of sliding-mode dynamics considering the event-triggered condition via the Lyapunov technique. Finally, the validity of our control strategy is verified by simulation.

The computational mechanism is used to support the proposed technique CSM and optimize the obtained results with global search technique genetic algorithms (GAs) hybridized with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for quick refinement. Painleve-I is solved by the proposed technique CSM-GASQP. In this process, variation of splines is implemented for various scenarios. The CSM-GASQP produces an interpolated function that is continuous upto its second derivative. Also, splines proved to be stable than a single polynomial fitted to all points, and reduce wiggles between the tabulated points. This method provides a reliable and excellent procedure for adaptation of unknown coefficients of splines by searching globally exploiting the performance of GA-SQP algorithms.

Design and performance of a Nafion dryer for continuous operation at CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> air monitoring sites	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												In preparation for routine deployment in a network of greenhouse gas monitoring stations, we have designed and tested a simple method for drying ambient air to near or below 0.2 % (2000 ppm) mole fraction H2O using a Nafion dryer. The inlet system was designed for use with cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS) analyzers such as the Picarro model G2301 that measure H2O in addition to their principal analytes, in this case CO2 and CH4. These analyzers report dry-gas mixing ratios without drying the sample by measuring H2O mixing ratio at the same frequency as the main analytes, and then correcting for the dilution and peak. broadening effects of H2O on the mixing ratios of the other analytes measured in moist air. However, it is difficult to accurately validate the water vapor correction in the field. By substantially lowering the amount of H2O in the sample, uncertainties in the applied water vapor corrections can be reduced by an order of magnitude or more, thus eliminating the need to determine instrument-specific water vapor correction coefficients and to verify the stability over time. Our Nafion drying inlet system takes advantage of the extra capacity of the analyzer pump to redirect 30 % of the dry gas exiting the Nafion to the outer shell side of the dryer and has no consumables. We tested the Nafion dryer against a cryotrap (-97 degrees C) method for removing H2O and found that in wet-air tests, the Nafion reduces the CO2 dry-gas mixing ratios of the sample gas by as much as 0.1 +/- 0.01 ppm due to leakage across the membrane. The effect on CH4 was smaller and varied within +/- 0.2 ppb, with an approximate uncertainty of 0.1 ppb. The Nafion-induced CO2 bias is partially offset by sending the dry reference gases through the Nafion dryer as well. The residual bias due to the impact of moisture differences between sample and reference gas on the permeation through the Nafion was approximately -0.05 ppm for CO2 and varied within +/- 0.2 ppb for CH4. The uncertainty of this partial drying method is within the WMO compatibility guidelines for the Northern Hemisphere, 0.1 ppm for CO2 and 2 ppb for CH4, and is comparable to experimentally determining water vapor corrections for each instrument but less subject to concerns of possible drift in these corrections.

In addition, a new design algorithm for DTCNNs is developed based on stability theory (not based on the well-known perceptron training algorithm), and the convergence of the design algorithm can be guaranteed by some stability theorems. Finally, the simulating results demonstrate the validity and feasibility of our proposed approach.

This is especially important at the urban-agriculture interface where water quality conditions can change rapidly over short distances. The objective of this research was to optimize the spatial allocation of discrete monitoring sites for synoptic water quality monitoring through analysis of continuous longitudinal monitoring data collected by attaching a water quality sonde and GPS to a boat. Sampling was conducted six times from March to October 2009 along a 6.5 km segment of the Wen-Rui Tang River in eastern China that represented an urban-agricultural interface. When travelling at a velocity of similar to 2.4 km h(-1), this resulted in water quality measurements at similar to 20 m interval. Ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), and turbidity data were collected and analyzed using Cluster Analysis (CA) to identify optimal locations for establishment of long-term monitoring sites. The analysis identified two distinct water quality segments for NH4+-N and EC and three distinct segments for DO and turbidity. According to our research results, the current fixed-location sampling sites should be adjusted to more effectively capture the distinct differences in the spatial distribution of water quality conditions. In addition, this methodology identified river reaches that require more comprehensive study of the factors leading to the changes in water quality within the identified river segment. The study demonstrates that continuous longitudinal monitoring can be a highly effective method for optimizing monitoring site locations for water quality studies.

The antenna is constructed by two cascaded discrete dielectric lenses, which are designed based on a diffractive deep neural network ((DNN)-N-2) with an improved loss function, fed by a static horn. The DDL antenna can achieve dynamic holographic imaging by a simple mechanical translation of the perfect electric conductor (PEC) mask attached to the first lens instead of locally controlling individual meta-atoms through incorporating active elements or phase change materials with complicated feeding networks. The phase profiles for the DDL antenna design are obtained by training four customized input field patterns and corresponding anticipated output target images with the modified (DNN)-N-2. Dynamic switching of four number images "1, 2, 3, 4" is demonstrated by both full-wave simulated and experimental results. The proposed DDL antenna and design strategy present a new approach to achieve wavefront reconfiguration, especially in the absence of tunable components at high frequencies.

In terms of a Markov chain, the event of mode switching at various times is considered in both the parameters and the discrete delays of the neural networks. The state estimation is analyzed when the information is transmitted over a digital communication channel. In this concern the design of the quantizer and the estimator is jointly investigated. The purpose of the concerned problem is to design a mode-dependent state estimator such that the network states are estimated through available output measurements such that the dynamics of the estimation error is stochastically stable. Novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed and sufficient constraints are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities such that the existence of the desired estimator is assured. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through a simulation example.

Multi-Rate Discrete Optimal Controller Design for Multi Sensor Network Systems via LMI	ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS					8th National Conference on Thermophysical Properties (NCTP)	DEC 14-16, 2015	Jaipur, INDIA					This paper proposes a discrete optimal control method based on a multi-rate digital observer for multi sensor network systems. In many multi sensor network systems, the sensing time ratios are generally different each other such that the identical estimation time should be applied at the fastest measuring time for design of an observer in spite of the repeatability of output signals sensed at slower measuring time. This paper proposes the optimal control method based on Kalman filter to store repeated signals in memories in order avoid unnecessary processes. The proposed control system is operated according to the slow measuring time. All signals are calculated to estimate the system states without any repeated data. The proposed design method of the discrete observer develops the performance of low level microcontroller with slow operating abilities since the controller is able to actuate at slow operating time without any loss of output information using simple data storage systems. The optimal stability of the controlled system is verified according to the separation principle of linear quadratic Gaussian system with a single time ratio.																			1936-6612	1936-7317				NOV	2016	22	11					3492	3496		10.1166/asl.2016.7950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/asl.2016.7950													WOS:000399358000066

The uncertainties are approximated by a set of adaptive fuzzy logic systems, with the adjusted parameters updated by a simplified recursive least squares estimation algorithm, combined with a state observer. For a constant known network-induced time-delay, the proposed modified dynamic surface control utilising the predicted system states, expands the acceptable network-induced time-delay and stable operating range for a discrete-time non-linear pure-feedback MIMO system in the network.

The proposed synthesis technique enables to realize associative memories with several advantageous features. First of all, grey-level as well as bipolar images can be stored. Moreover, the proposed approach generates networks with learning and forgetting capabilities. Finally, it is possible to design networks with any kind of predetermined interconnection structure. In particular, neighbourhoods without line crossings can be chosen, greatly simplifying the VLSI implementation of the designed DTCNNs. In the first part of this work a model of a multilevel threshold network is presented and a stability analysis is carried out using basic notions deriving from non-linear dynamical system theory. The synthesis procedure is then developed by means of a pseudoinversion technique, assuring learning and forgetting capabilities of the designed DTCNN. The use of a neighbourhood without line crossings is also discussed. Simulation results are reported to show the capability of the proposed approach.

However, previous works are mostly limited to MLPs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn from non-euclidean data structures such as molecular structures efficiently and are thus highly relevant to computer -aided molecular design (CAMD).

We optimize simultaneously the network architecture and the link dimensioning under discrete cost functions in order to route all traffic demands in line with traffic growth over a discrete time horizon. Because of operational requirements, routing paths used at a given period to route some traffic demands have to be preserved over subsequent periods; this is called incremental routing with respect to incremental flow. To handle the high dimensionality, a compact formulation omitting explicitly written flow variables is given. We examine the dominant polyhedron of the incremental multicommodity flow and provide a polyhedral study of it. Finally, a solution approach taking advantage of the polyhedral structure of MPNDI is proposed, and computational results for a range of instances with 8 and 10 nodes are provided.

In order to make effective design decisions, simulations of these systems must possess the following properties: (1) have high accuracy and fidelity, (2) produce results in a timely manner, and (3) be able to analyze a broad range of network workloads. Most state-of-the-art HPC network simulation frameworks, however, are constrained in one or more of these areas. In this work, we present a simulation framework for modeling two important classes of networks used in today's IBM and Cray supercomputers: torus and dragonfly networks. We use the Co-Design of Multi-layer Exascale Storage Architecture (CODES) simulation framework to simulate these network topologies at a flit-level detail using the Rensselaer Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS) for parallel discrete-event simulation. Our simulation framework meets all the requirements of a practical network simulation and can assist network designers in design space exploration. First, it uses validated and detailed flit-level network models to provide an accurate and high-fidelity network simulation. Second, instead of relying on serial time-stepped or traditional conservative discrete-event simulations that limit simulation scalability and efficiency, we use the optimistic event-scheduling capability of ROSS to achieve efficient and scalable HPC network simulations on today's high-performance cluster systems. Third, our models give network designers a choice in simulating a broad range of network workloads, including HPC application workloads using detailed network traces, an ability that is rarely offered in parallel with high-fidelity network simulations.

Assume that the measured output of the networked time-delay system can be quantized by the logarithmic quantizer before being transmitted through the communication network. In addition, an appropriate compensation strategy is proposed to reduce the effect of the data packet dropout satisfying a Bernoulli distribution. To deal with the quantization issue, the sector bound method can be used to convert the quantized control problem of the networked system into the robust control problem with uncertainty. Then, a novel observer-based H-infinity output feedback controller is designed to ensure that the networked system is exponentially mean-square stable and an expected H-infinity performance constraint is achieved. Finally, a simulation example is given to prove the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

This makes it possible to apply MPC technology to local control for high-dimensional multiple-input-multiple-output systems. The convergence issue of the discrete-time neural network is first studied. By choosing a proper error function, a sufficient condition is obtained under which the neural network converges to the exact optimal solution globally. This is the theoretical basis of this paper. An integrated hardware and software design method to implement the neural network on a DSP chip as a universal QP solver is then developed. With the QP solver handling the computational tasks in MPC problems, a general DSP-based MPC controller is achieved. A prototype system is built on a TMDSEVM6678L DSP development board. It is then applied to an air-separation-unit system and achieves satisfactory control performance. This verifies the effectiveness of the whole design.																			0278-0046	1557-9948				DEC	2014	61	12					7035	7045		10.1109/TIE.2014.2316250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2316250													WOS:000342282900057

Our solvability conditions reveal that the synchronization problem is solvable for all possible, a priori given, set of graphs associated with a communication network only under the condition that the agents are at most weakly unstable (ie, agents have all eigenvalues in the closed unit disc). However, if an upper bound on the eigenvalues inside the unit disc of the row stochastic matrices associated with any graph in a given set of graphs is known, then one can achieve synchronization for a class of unstable agents. We provide protocol design for at most weakly unstable agents based on a direct eigenstructure assignment method and a standard H-2 discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation. We also provide protocol design for strictly unstable agents (ie, agents have at least one eigenvalue outside the unit disc) based on the standard H-2 discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation.

More precisely, we shed light into the design of secure mixed RF-FSO relay networks by questioning two critical design problems: 1) What are the main parameters in the design of secure RF-FSO relay networks? 2) How can we improve the confidentiality of the optical information? To do so, we derive the secrecy outage probability and the probability of positive secrecy capacity performance for mixed RF-FSO relaying schemes under RF and FSO eavesdropper attacks, respectively. To justify the problem, we consider two general fading models, Nakagami-m at the RF side and exponentiated Weibull distribution at the FSO side. The results, which are validated with the Monte-Carlo simulations, show that both the location and the size of the photo-aperture is very important in the design of RF-FSO relay networks to enhance the secrecy performance of the overall system.

First, a more general stability criterion is proposed for nonlinear switched systems on time scales, in which the value of Lyapunov function at some switching instants may not necessarily decrease. Second, based on the discretized Lyapunov function technique, a sufficient condition is derived for stability analysis of linear switched systems with all subsystems unstable on a special kind of time scale (the graininess function is constant). It is shown that this approach does not require the system matrix of one subsystem must commute with the one of the other subsystem, which is essential for stability analysis of linear switched systems on non-uniform time domains by the eigenvalue based approach in the existing results. Moreover, the idea of this paper not only provides a unified approach to study continuous switched systems and their discrete counterparts simultaneously, but also is effective to investigate stability problems of other systems on uniform or non-uniform time domains. Two examples are given for illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling and Control of Wave Propagation in a Ring With Applications to Power Grids	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												This paper concerns the treatment of swing dynamics in a power grid using a continuous approach. Rather than addressing the problem as oscillations in a discrete system, we model the swing dynamics as a propagating electro-mechanical wave using a partial differential equation. A ring geometry with a one-dimensional wave equation is used to analyze the underlying dynamics. A control method is proposed to damp the system dynamics using the concept of Interior Wave Suppression. Unlikedomains withboundaries such as strings, any concentrated input to the ring generates waves in two directions, thereby preventing total absorption. Using a judicious combination of concentrated control inputs, it is shown that a near unidirectional wave can be generated, with minimal backwaves. The resulting closed-loop system is proved to be stable. The overall modeling and control methods are shown to be implementable in a power grid using phasor measurement units as sensors and flexible ac transmission system devices, such as thyristor controlled series compensator, as actuators. How, the proposed methods of modeling and control can be applied to a network of rings is briefly discussed. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate the theoretical derivations.

To facilitate analysis, a discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model with a fast and uniform period is introduced to approximate continuous nonlinear systems. A slow and nonuniform sampler between system and filter is proposed to overcome the contradictions between fast sampling period and limited bandwidth. The nonuniform sampling interval of sampler is subject to a Markov chain. To make full use of the partial information of sampling interval which is accessible to the filter, the asynchronous filter which is described by the hidden Markov model is introduced to reduce conservatism. By resorting to the augmentation approach and the Lyapunov functional method which depends on nonuniform sampling interval, some sufficient conditions for the existence of asynchronous filer are given to guarantee the stability and dissipativity of the augmented system. The gains of asynchronous filter are given via solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Two examples are utilized to illustrate the validity of the developed filter design technique where the relationships between optimal dissipative performance indices and the mode synchronization rate are given.

Existing studies mainly focus on classifying varied distracted driving behaviors, which depend heavily on the scale and quality of datasets and only detect the discrete distraction categories. Therefore, most data-driven approaches have limited capability of recognizing unseen driving activities and cannot provide a reasonable solution for downstream applications. To address these challenges, this paper develops a vision Transformer-enabled weakly supervised contrastive (W-SupCon) learning framework, in which distracted behaviors are quantified by calculating their distances from the normal driving representation set. The Gaussian mixed model (GMM) is employed for the representation clustering, which centralizes the distribution of the normal driving representation set to better identify distracted behaviors. A novel driver behavior dataset and the other three ones are employed for the evaluation, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach has more accurate and robust performance than existing methods in the recognition of unknown driver activities.

J	Sikder, S; Mukherjee, I; Panja, SC				Sikder, Sagar; Mukherjee, Indrajit; Panja, Subhash Chandra			A synergistic Mahalanobis -Taguchi system and support vector regression based predictive multivariate manufacturing process quality control approach	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS												The primary objective of this study is to propose and verify a new synergistic prediction-based multivariate process quality control (MPQC) approach for manufacturing processes. The proposed approach considers the influence of covariates (e.g. uncontrollable inputs) and output (or response) uncertainties to predict, monitor, diagnose, and adjust for out-of-control scenarios. The prediction-based real-time synergistic approach integrates off-line and on-line multivariate quality control strategies. In this approach, based on a current state prediction of responses, process control variables are adjusted to prevent any out-of-control or abnormal situations in the process. The unique approach is designed based on a Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MTS), support vector regression (SVR), bootstrap prediction interval (PI), and derivative-free Nelder-Mead (NM) optimisation strategy. Two real-life case studies demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach and show improvements in process performance. This easy-to-implement distribution-free predictive quality control approach provides the necessary flexibility to industry practitioners for real-life implementation in discrete or continuous manufacturing processes.

J	Liu, ML; Tornatore, M; Mukherjee, B				Liu, Menglin; Tornatore, Massimo; Mukherjee, Biswanath			New Strategies for Connection Protection in Mixed-Line-Rate Optical WDM Networks	JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING												Today's optical wavelength division multiplexing backbone networks need to support traffic demands with very diverse capacity requirements. Recent studies have shown how to design an optical transport network that supports mixed line rates (MLR), where the wavelength channels of the optical paths (i.e., lightpaths) can have a variety of capacities (10/40/100 Gbps). Some preliminary work on the design of MLR optical networks has already appeared, but survivability, which is a key concern in optical network design, is a nascent topic in MLR networks. This study investigates the problem of protection in MLR optical networks: in particular, we study how to design a cost-effective transparent MLR network that provides dedicated protection at the lightpath level. We propose three mechanisms: MLR-at-p-lightpath protection (MLR-p), MLR-at-lightpath protection (MLR-l), and MLR-with-backup-flow-grooming protection (MLR-g). The design problem is solved by two different approaches: (1) a two-step approach that formulates part of the problem as an integer linear program and (2) a heuristic approach. Our results show that, by appropriate assignment of rates to lightpaths, MLR networks can provide protection for diverse traffic demands with much lower transponder cost compared to single-line-rate networks.

C	Gordon, EK; Zarrin, RS			IEEE	Gordon, Ethan K.; Zarrin, Rana Soltani			Online augmentation of learned grasp sequence policies for more adaptable and data-efficient in-hand manipulation	2023 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION, ICRA	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA				IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	MAY 29-JUN 02, 2023	London, ENGLAND	IEEE, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc				When using a tool, the grasps used for picking it up, reposing, and holding it in a suitable pose for the desired task could be distinct. Therefore, a key challenge for autonomous in-hand tool manipulation is finding a sequence of grasps that facilitates every step of the tool use process while continuously maintaining force closure and stability. Due to the complexity of modeling the contact dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can provide a solution in this continuous space subject to highly parameterized physical models. However, these techniques impose a trade-off in adaptability and data efficiency. At test time the tool properties, desired trajectory, and desired application forces could differ substantially from training scenarios. Adapting to this necessitates more data or computationally expensive online policy updates. In this work, we apply the principles of discrete dynamic programming (DP) to augment RL performance with domain knowledge. Specifically, we first design a computationally simple approximation of our environment. We then demonstrate in physical simulation that performing tree searches (i.e., lookaheads) and policy rollouts with this approximation can improve an RL-derived grasp sequence policy with minimal additional online computation. Additionally, we show that pretraining a deep RL network with the DP-derived solution to the discretized problem can speed up policy training.

First, a useful lemma is established on the basis of discrete-time Lyapunov theory and interval estimate methods, which contributes to the stability of partial sampled-data control (PSC) systems. According to the features of the designed control scheme, a single-interval-dependent functional and a double-intervals-dependent functional are constructed by utilizing the corresponding interval information, respectively. Unlike the previous Lyapunov functional methods, the proposed functionals are essentially continuous and then some additional constraint conditions are removed. Then, based on several inequality methods, two sufficient criteria dependent on the controller gain, sampling period, and allowable data loss ratio (ADLR), are respectively developed to guarantee the global synchronization of Lur'e systems. Additionally, the quantitative analysis about the ADLR is discussed. Compared with the existing results, the developed interval-dependent functional techniques are beneficial to enlarging the ADLR. Finally, illustrative examples and an application to image encryption are given to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

J	Tien, VD				Tien Van Do			An efficient solution to a retrial queue for the performability evaluation of DHCP	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is designed to provide an automatic mechanism for the allocation, configuration and management of IP addresses and TCP/IP protocol stack parameters of computers and devices in IP networks. The important feature of DHCP is a "dynamic allocation" mechanism, which assigns an IP address to a client for a limited period of time (called a lease time). Therefore, a previously allocated IP address can automatically be assigned to another host by a DHCP server upon the expiration of the lease time if a host does not renew the use of an allocated IP address. This paper proposes a retrial queueing model to approximate the performability of the DHCP dynamic allocation mechanism. An efficient computational algorithm is developed to calculate the steady state probabilities of a continuous time discrete state Markov process. A comparison of our approximate model with a detailed simulation model of the DHCP dynamic allocation mechanism shows an excellent agreement between the analytical and the simulation results. The impact of the lease time parameter on the performability of the DHCP dynamic allocation mechanism is also illustrated through a numerical study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This advancement provides analog, digital, and essential mixed signal circuits are integrated on a semiconductor device, which is used to build any modern consumer electronic applications including smart devices. In order to verify or test the mixed signals traditional techniques are not encouraging because of cost, performance and production time. The formal verification is technique which provides the evident of conscious algorithms in a system with respect to formal methods. The demand of formal verification in system on chip (SoC) designs in context of both software and hardware is high because of its cost and accuracy. In this paper, the design of formal verification of mixed signals using Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) is analyzed. The design includes mixed signal module, FFNN implemented design, and formal verification for analyze the accuracy of the trained network. The training of FFNN network is performed by using Verilog HDL over Xilinx platform on low cost Artix-7 FPGA. From outcomes it is found that formal verification achieves 94.00% of accuracy with less processing time.																			2194-5357	2194-5365	978-3-030-19813-8; 978-3-030-19812-1				2019	986						31	39		10.1007/978-3-030-19813-8_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-19813-8_4													WOS:000485163400004

However, read current noise in RRAM is one of the critical concerns for storage application, and its microscopic origin is still under debate. In this work, the read current noise in TaOx-based RRAM was studied thoroughly. Based on a noise power spectral density analysis at room temperature and at ultra-low temperature of 25 K, discrete random telegraph noise (RTN) and continuous average current fluctuation (ACF) are identified and decoupled from the total read current noise in TaOx RRAM devices. A statistical comparison of noise amplitude further reveals that ACF depends strongly on the temperature, whereas RTN is independent of the temperature. Measurement results combined with conduction mechanism analysis show that RTN in TaOx RRAM devices arises from electron trapping/detrapping process in the hopping conduction, and ACF is originated from the thermal activation of conduction centers that form the percolation network. At last, a unified model in the framework of hopping conduction is proposed to explain the underlying mechanism of both RTN and ACF noise, which can provide meaningful guidelines for designing noise-immune RRAM devices.

J	Cai, Y; Su, MX; Cai, XS				Cai Yang; Su Mingxu; Cai Xiaoshu			Method for Mixed-Particle Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network	ACTA OPTICA SINICA												Traditional methods for mixed-particle classification usually extract particle features from binary images. After designing appropriate features according to the particle type, particles can be classified using widely known classifiers, such as back-propagation neural network and support vector machine (SVM). However, classifying touching particles is a challenging, and inappropriate feature design may further reduce the classification accuracy. Herein, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to extract the features for building mixed -particle image classifiers. In particular, particle locations in an image arc determined using a region proposal network. Furthermore, a classifier is designed and combined with a fully convolutional network to achieve pixel -level particle segmentation. Experimental analysis is performed on some flowing-mixed -particle systems comprising spherical, elongated, and irregular particles. According to the analysis results, SVM method using manually designed features can achieve an average precision of 87% and recall of 87%, whereas those of the CNN-based method arc up to 97% and 93%, respectively. The latter method can also reduce the analysis error by more than 11% for number median diameter (Dn(50)) of irregular particles. In addition, several shortcomings in traditional methods, such as the need for manually designed features arc solved, making it easier to build an end -to-end system for effective real-time image analysis of flowing mixed particles.																			0253-2239					JUL 10	2019	39	7							0712002	10.3788/AOS201939.0712002	http://dx.doi.org/10.3788/AOS201939.0712002													WOS:000620139400045

J	Feng, Q; Nguang, SK; Perruquetti, W				Feng, Qian; Nguang, Sing Kiong; Perruquetti, Wilfrid			Dissipative stabilization of linear systems with time-varying general distributed delays	AUTOMATICA												New methods are developed for the stabilization of a linear system with general time-varying distributed delays existing at the system's states, inputs and outputs. In contrast to most existing literature where the function of time-varying delay is continuous and bounded, we assume it to be bounded and measurable. Furthermore, the distributed delay kernels can be any square-integrable function over a bounded interval, where the kernels are handled directly by using a decomposition scenario without using approximations. By constructing a Krasovski functional via the application of a novel integral inequality, sufficient conditions for the existence of a dissipative state feedback controller are derived in terms of matrix inequalities without utilizing the existing reciprocally convex combination lemmas. The proposed synthesis (stability) conditions, which take dissipativity into account, can be either solved directly by a standard numerical solver of semidefinite programming if they are convex, or reshaped into linear matrix inequalities, or solved via a proposed iterative algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, no existing methods can handle the synthesis problem investigated in this paper. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is also well known that programs developed in this way are hard to evolve, test, and maintain. These difficulties are intensified when continuous control problems have to be tackled or when the actuation must vary continually subject to the sensor inputs. Such is the case in day-lighting or occupancy-based control applications. In this paper, we propose a declarative high-level Domain-Specific Language that aims to reduce the effort required to specify the control logic of building automation systems. Our language combines fuzzy logic and temporal logic, enabling to define the behaviour in terms of domain abstractions. Finally, the approach has been validated in two ways: (i) in a case study that simulates the control system of an automated office room and (ii) by means of an empirical study to confirm usability (with a System Usability Scale questionnaire) and effectiveness, here regarded from the perspective of correctness, of the proposed language with respect to a well-known language like Simulink.

In an era of global environmental change, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a hotspot of natural hazards. Improving the capability of rural housing disaster insurance to foster local residents' disaster resilience is of great significance but remains under addressed. We used a discrete choice experiment approach to provide the first estimates of rural residents' preferences for rural housing disaster insurance attributes in central and western Tibet. We estimated residents' preferences and willingness-to-pay for the sum insured, subsidy rate, insured object, and perils covered. The potential impacts of increasing the sum insured, expanding the insured object, and lowering subsidy rates were evaluated. Our results suggest that residents prefer products with a high sum insured, high subsidy rate, and a complete list of insured objects. Residents who have experienced specific hazards tend to prefer the corresponding perils covered. Females and residents who have a closer social network are more likely to purchase insurance. Product improvement and policy simulation results suggest that, while lowering the subsidy rate, increasing the sum insured and expanding the insured object could promote participation and improve residents' welfare. Our results could improve the understanding of the preferences of households in remote regions and support policy implementations.

J	Marshall, WE; Garrick, NW				Marshall, Wesley E.; Garrick, Norman W.			Community design and how much we drive	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND LAND USE												The preponderance of evidence suggests that communities with denser and more connected street networks and a higher degree of mixed land uses results in fewer vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT). However, there is less agreement on the size of the effect. Also, there is no clear understanding of the specific aspects of community design-such as street networks and land use mix-that are most important in contributing to lower VKT. One reason why there is some confusion on this point is that past studies have not always made a clear distinction between different street network design characteristics such as density, connectivity, and configuration. In this research, care was taken to control for land use mix while fully characterizing the different features of the street network, including a street pattern classification system that works at the neighborhood level but also focuses on the citywide street network as a separate entity. We employ a spatial kriging analysis of National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data in combination with a generalized linear regression model in order to examine the extent to which community design, particularly in terms of street network design while controlling land use mix, influences VKT in 24 California cities of populations from 30,000 to just over 100,000. Our results suggest that residents of more compact street network designs tend to drive less. Street connectivity, however, played an adverse role in performance.

Digital high-pass filter deconvolution by means of an infinite impulse response filter	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT												In the application of semiconductor detectors, the charge-sensitive amplifier is widely used in front-end electronics. The output signal is shaped by a typical exponential decay. Depending on the feedback network, this type of front-end electronics suffers from the ballistic deficit problem, or an increased rate of pulse pile-ups. Moreover, spectroscopy applications require a correction of the pulse-height, while a shortened pulse-width is desirable for high-throughput applications. For both objectives, digital de convolution of the exponential decay is convenient. With a general method and the signals of our custom charge-sensitive amplifier for cadmium zinc telluride detectors, we show how the transfer function of an amplifier is adapted to an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. This paper investigates different design methods for an IIR filter in the discrete-time domain and verifies the obtained filter coefficients with respect to the equivalent continuous-time frequency response. Finally, the exponential decay is shaped to a step-like output signal that is exploited by a forward-looking pulse processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dimitriou, L				Dimitriou, Loukas			Optimal competitive pricing in European port container terminals: A game-theoretical framework	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES												Containers' handling in dedicated port terminals correspond to a highly competitive market where pricing strategies play a decisive role in their economic and operational performance. For that reason, the formation of an appropriate pricing strategy should follow a thorough methodological treatment supporting policymaking and state-of-the-practice. In the current paper, such a methodological framework is developed and applied to a realistic system, incorporating the concept of pricing differentiation among competing container port facilities. Such an approach may identify pricing strategies that significantly differ from the marginal cost pricing practice, typically adopted by the majority of port authorities. As so, the proposed framework uses elements from non-cooperative game theory and equilibrium network design, enabling its application in realistic large-scale cases. Two distinctive instances are analysed in an additive manner, (a) one simplified case demonstrating the properties of the methodological framework and (b) a generalized case reflecting the market of European container terminals. Moreover, optimal pricing strategies are estimated by two distinctive game formats: a strategic/matrix form of discrete strategies and a continuous game form, each confirmatory of the other. The results provide evidence of the pricing opportunities associated with ports' geographical location especially in relation with the demand profiles manifested in such spatially separated markets.																			2590-1982					MAR	2021	9								100287	10.1016/j.trip.2020.100287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100287													WOS:001133257400004

Self Focusing of 2D Arrays for SHM of Plate-Like Structures Using Time Reversal Operator	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2011: CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE AND INTELLIGENT STRUCTURES, VOL 1	Structural Health Monitoring				8th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring	SEP 13-15, 2011	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA	AF Off Sci Res, Army Res Off, Natl Sci Fdn, Off Naval Res	Stanford Univ			Lamb waves have shown a great potential in structural health monitoring (SHIM) of thin plates that are frequently used in engineering structures. Dense transducer networks or active ultrasonic arrays can be employed to generate and receive Lamb waves. Active arrays, however, enable beam steering and can work as spatial filters enabling assessment of large plate areas from a single fixed position. In this paper a novel method for selective focusing of Lamb waves is presented. The algorithm is an extension of the DORT method (French acronym for decomposition of time-reversal operator) where the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is used for the time-frequency representation (TFR) of nonstationary signals instead of the discrete Fourier transform. An application of the proposed method to self focusing of Lamb waves in an aluminum plate is demonstrated both for a linear and a 2D star-shaped array. The 2D star-like array was designed to eliminate the effect of ambiguous mirrored images encountered for linear arrays. The results obtained with both arrays are presented and compared in the paper. It is shown that the decomposition of the time reversal operator obtained with the proposed method enabled separating point like scatters in the aluminum plate and allowed to focus Lamb waves at a desired point.

The proposed framework is based on a notion of so-called stochastic simulation function enabling us to use an abstract system as a substitution of the original one in the controller design process with guaranteed error bounds. In the first part of the paper, we derive sufficient small-gain type conditions for the compositional quantification of the distance in probability between the interconnection of stochastic control subsystems and that of their (finite or infinite) abstractions. In the second part of the paper, we construct finite abstractions together with their corresponding stochastic simulation functions for the class of linear stochastic control systems. We apply our results to the temperature regulation in a circular building by constructing compositionally a finite abstraction of a network containing 1000 rooms. We use the constructed finite abstractions as substitutes to synthesize policies compositionally regulating the temperature in each room for a bounded time horizon.

Network is modeled as an nth order discrete system whose available bandwidth variations at the bottlenecked link act as an exogenous unmatched disturbance. The proposed scheme is characterized by a simple first order design which is applied to nth order systems through aggregation. Effect of bandwidth variation at the congested node which is modeled as a disturbance, is well accounted in controller design with widely adopted delay-based disturbance estimation. Performance of the proposed scheme is validated through Matlab and ns simulations. Simulation results shows that all the proposed reduced order control scheme tracks the desired queue length effectively under the adverse influence of unmatched disturbances.																			1935-4576		978-1-4799-0752-6				2013							618	623																WOS:000335552900090

However, a drawback of the conventional disturbance observers is that they all assume persistent excitation (PE) of the systems. As a result, they may lead to poor estimation precision when PE is not ensured, for instance, when the disturbance gain of the system is close to the singularity. In this paper, we propose a novel disturbance observer based on concurrent learning (CL) with time-variant history stacks, which ensures high estimation precision even in PE-free cases. The disturbance observer is designed in both continuous and discrete time. The estimation errors of the proposed method are proved to converge to a bounded set using the Lyapunov method. A history-sample-selection procedure is proposed to reduce the estimation error caused by the accumulation of old history samples. A simulation study on epidemic control shows that the proposed method produces higher estimation precision than the conventional disturbance observer when PE is not satisfied. This justifies the correctness of the proposed CL-based disturbance observer and verifies its applicability to solving practical problems.

RISs can manipulate impinging waves through their electromagnetic elements enabling some sort of control over the wireless channel. The potential of RIS technology is explored to perform a sort of virtual equalization over-the-air for frequency-selective channels, whereas equalization is generally conducted at either the transmitter or receiver in conventional communication systems. Specifically, using an RIS, the frequency-selective channel from the transmitter to the RIS is transformed to a frequency-flat channel through elimination of inter-symbol interference (ISI) components at the receiver. ISI is eliminated by adjusting the phases of impinging signals particularly to maximize the incoming signal of the strongest tap. First, a general end-to-end system model is provided and a continuous to discrete-time signal model is presented. Subsequently, a probabilistic analysis for elimination of ISI terms is conducted and reinforced with computer simulations. Furthermore, a theoretical error probability analysis is performed along with computer simulations. It is analysed and demonstrated that conventional RIS phase alignment methods can successfully eliminate ISI, and the RIS-aided communication channel can be converted from frequency-selective to frequency-flat.

Meanwhile, the inherent heterogeneity and concurrency existing in hybrid systems trigger multiple decision challenges, including behavior uncertainty and states consistency. It is difficult to express the complicated nonlinear mapping relationship between decision results and hybrid situations. This proposes the decision-making scheme M-HSTPN-DL with a three-tier architecture based on modified hybrid stochastic timed Petri net (M-HSTPN) and deep learning (DL). Among them, M-HSTPN describes the various hybrid situations, and DL models are taken as the decision model to express the nonlinear relationship between decision results and hybrid situations. Then the training and calling mechanism of decision models is introduced. Taking the hybrid system of bearing fault diagnosis as an example, we compare the decision-making ability of multiple decision models and analyze the advantage of M-HSTPN-DL. It has proven to be that the M-HSTPN-DL architecture can adequately represent the hybrid situation and solves the complex decision- making problem of hybrid systems.																			1932-8184	1937-9234				JUN	2021	15	2					1804	1814		10.1109/JSYST.2020.2983044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2020.2983044													WOS:000659552700029

Based on application requirements, various network configurations can be designed. One such robust configuration is a hybrid wired-cum-wireless sensor network that is composed of a wireless sensor network and a wired backbone which are inter-connected via access points. In this paper, the joint problem of configuring a hybrid wired-cum-wireless sensor network, position-constrained cluster head and access point placement is proposed. The design considers real wireless communication limitations, optimum locations of access points and cluster heads, and hybrid transmission structure of the network with the objective of minimising the network configuration cost. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming and solved using 'CPLEX'. Numerical results show that hybrid configuration is more cost effective than the wireless networks and leads to a longer lifetime at the expense of a more complex design.

Computational methodology is derived from the basic principles of reaction and mixing. Candidate reactor networks are generated by expanding the solution space into regions where different levels of mixing are required. Directions of extending the design space are identified by using formal optimization theory. A set of candidate reactor networks is generated in a finite number of the solution space extensions. The derived methodology eliminates the requirement for an postulated superstructure and the use of qualitative knowledge for finding the optimal solution. With certain modifications the proposed design procedure can also be used to support tile design of batch processes. The generated reactor structures are truly optimal. The proposed methodology is illustrated by an example of integrating chemical reactors into the overall process.

An integrated PSO for parameter determination and feature selection of ELM and its application in classification of power system disturbances	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												This paper presents a performance enhancement scheme for the recently developed extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying power system disturbances using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Learning time is an important factor while designing any computational intelligent algorithms for classifications. ELM is a single hidden layer neural network with good generalization capabilities and extremely fast learning capacity. In ELM, the input weights are chosen randomly and the output weights are calculated analytically. However, ELM may need higher number of hidden neurons due to the random determination of the input weights and hidden biases. One of the advantages of ELM over other methods is that the parameter that the user must properly adjust is the number of hidden nodes only. But the optimal selection of its parameter can improve its performance. In this paper, a hybrid optimization mechanism is proposed which combines the discrete-valued PSO with the continuous-valued PSO to optimize the input feature subset selection and the number of hidden nodes to enhance the performance of ELM. The experimental results showed the proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate in discriminating power system disturbances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Resource management and environment conservation are currently frequently discussed topics worldwide. In this study, a discrete optimization model formulation is presented for an integrated energy, water, and food (EWF) supply chain problem. The optimization model examines the temporal and spatial integration of the EWF supply chain elements to provide optimal infrastructure capacity expansion of essential commodities within the EWF system, and their corresponding periodic optimal supply for a given region. Furthermore, the model considers endogenous demand between the EWF elements that reflect the interdependency of nexus elements. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed to assist in the process of optimal infrastructure capacity expansion and operation of the EWF system. A case study is given to show the application of the proposed mathematical programming model. Several scenarios are assumed for the case study under different commodity prices and climate change conditions. In addition, diversification in the energy and agriculture sectors is examined by shifting from international refined sugar trading to bioethanol production. The results show economic gains of similar to 10% under the emergence of bioethanol production compared with the business-as-usual scenario.

All pipes in the network are used for either deposition (charging) or removal (discharging). The second design is a dual-pipe network design in which a network of HTF pipes carries charging fluid and a separate piping network carries discharging HTF.

Complex 4 can also be synthesized when employing I as a precursor in an extensive study of the anion-exchange reaction. This represents the first successful conversion of a discrete cage into a 3D coordination network based on a cage structure. Complex 2 remains invariable during anion-exchange reactions because uncoordinated Cl- ions are located in the comparatively small inner cavity.

MLR networks can be designed to provide flexible rate assignments to low-bit-rate services and high-bit-rate services in a cost-effective manner. But with increasing number of wavelengths in the network, aggregating wavelengths into wavebands can further reduce the network cost. In this study, we incorporate the idea of waveband switching in MLR network design. Wavebanding or grouping of optical paths reduces the optical switch size at the optical cross-connects (OXCs). When several lightpaths share several common links, they can be grouped together and routed as a single waveband. For optical bypass at a transit node, only two optical ports are required for each waveband, hence reducing the port cost. It can be a challenge for an MLR network to waveband wavelengths of different line rates that have different transmission reaches. In our design, we present a suitable switching architecture and propose an efficient and cost-effective approach for wavebanding in an MLR network. The design problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) where the objective is to minimize transponder cost and port cost. A heuristic algorithm for wavebanding in MLR networks is provided. To further optimize our solution, we also present a Simulated Annealing algorithm for wavebanding. Our results show a significant improvement in cost savings compared to single-line-rate (SLR) networks with wavebanding and an MLR network employing only wavelength switching. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The design of state cost weighting matrix (Q ) has been performed for different conditions namely (i) for controllability and observability technique, (ii) for optimisation and (iii) by providing equal weightage to all the system states while designing the discrete LQR LFC. The enactment of LFC design is checked for standard load disturbance considering the different sample time with diverse structures of Q. Further, the feedback gain matrix obtained via implementing the discrete LQR for control areas of power system using different models of Q is used to meritoriously train the GRNN for assorted operating conditions. At last, the performance of the designed GRNN is evaluated for extensive operating conditions with and without non-linearities and the obtained results are compared with multi-layer perceptron founded artificial neural network and genetic algorithm founded LFC of an energy delivery system.

Our task was to develop a structure analysis method to evaluate these changes quantitatively. We exposed HeLa cells to continuous ultrasound (1 MHz, 1 and 2 W/cm(2), 10 min at 37 degrees C). The microtubules were detected by the monoclonal antibody TU-01/SwAM/FlTC, observed in a fluorescence microscope and photographed digitally. The images were processed by "FFT magic" software. The structure analysis is based on frequency domain filtering using discrete Fourier transform. The basic idea is to design filters to extract information describing best the structural changes. The properties of the filter can be enhanced by direction filtering, i.e., extraction of a symmetric angular segment in the frequency domain centered on a zero frequency. The final image is a normalized sum of inverse FFT's of such segmented spectra. We needed a method yielding a single number assigned to the structure, e.g., the ratio of the area of microtubules to the total cell area. Assuming that the image background intensity is constant, we can use thresholding to detect areas occupied by the cells. The information about the area of the microtubules is contained in a wide range of higher intensities. Therefore, we use a gamma correction. The area occupied by microtubules is then considered an area with intensities above the selected threshold. There were tested three different filters to extract information about microtubules. The mathematical method chosen seems sensitive enough for quantitative assessment of changes of the microtubular network.

J	Zhang, WJ; Natarajan, B				Zhang, Wenji; Natarajan, Balasubramaniam			On the Performance of Kalman Filter for Markov Jump Linear Systems with Mode Mismatch	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING												Markov jump linear system (MJLS) is a class of hybrid systems where the continuous states evolve linearly and the discrete state transitions are modeled via a Markov chain. It has been shown that the optimal estimator for MJLS is a mode-based Kalman filter when the discrete mode is given. However, in practical applications, there are situations where the mode information is inaccurate and mode mismatches result in a biased estimate from the mode-based Kalman filter. This paper, for the first time, studies the impact of time correlated mode mismatch errors on MJLS state estimation using a mode-based Kalman filter. Unlike prior efforts that (1) assume mode mismatches are independent and identically distributed and (2) are limited to bi-modal systems, this paper is built on a general MJLS setup with a Markovian model for mode mismatch errors. The main contribution of this work lies in deriving the statistics of the bias term from a mode-based Kalman filter estimation with the aforementioned system setup. The sufficient conditions based on the probabilities of mode mismatch errors for the bias to be statistically convergent are derived. Since time correlated mode mismatch errors can effectively capture communication link impairments in a cyber-physical system, this new fundamental result provides guidance on the design of estimation strategies for MJLS and sheds light on their resilience in the presence of mode mismatch errors.																			0278-081X	1531-5878				APR	2021	40	4					1720	1742		10.1007/s00034-020-01545-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00034-020-01545-0		SEP 2020											WOS:000570442500001

The state prediction is used to compensate for the effect of the sensor-to-controller delay, and the system can be stabilized by the discrete predictor-based controller.

The complex networks addressed which include neural and social networks as special cases are quite general. Rather than the commonly used Lipschitz-type function, a more general sector-like nonlinear function is employed to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. The distributed infinite time delays in the discrete-time domain are first defined. By utilizing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed discrete-time complex network with distributed delays is synchronized if certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. The state estimation problem is then studied for the same complex network, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that, for all admissible discrete and distributed delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be globally asymptotically stable. Again, an LMI approach is developed for the state estimation problem. Two simulation examples are provided to show the usefulness of the proposed global synchronization and state estimation conditions. It is worth pointing out that our main results are valid even if the nominal subsystems within the network are unstable.

Based on a new discrete-time model, two approaches of robust controller design are proposed-design of a memoryless state-feedback controller and design of a dynamic state-feedback controller. The proposed memoryless state-feedback controller design method is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the delay bound can be computed by using the standard LMI techniques. A numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this methodology. The proposed dynamic state-feedback controller design method is based on a discrete-time Artstein transform. With the sufficient conditions for robust stability and H-infinity control developed in this paper, we also derive the upper bound of network-induced time delays and the lower bound of the network date-transmission rate that can be used as a guideline in choosing proper networks as communication media for NCSs. We constructed an NCS test bed to experimentally verify the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed design methodologies.																					978-0-7918-4216-4				2005							59	66																WOS:000245508100008
J	Ronellenfitsch, H				Ronellenfitsch, Henrik			Optimal Elasticity of Biological Networks	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS												Reinforced elastic sheets surround us in daily life, from concrete shell buildings to biological structures such as the arthropod exoskeleton or the venation network of dicotyledonous plant leaves. Natural structures are often highly optimized through evolution and natural selection, leading to the biologically and practically relevant problem of understanding and applying the principles of their design. Inspired by the hierarchically organized scaffolding networks found in plant leaves, here we model networks of bending beams that capture the discrete and nonuniform nature of natural materials. Using the principle of maximal rigidity under natural resource constraints, we show that optimal discrete beam networks reproduce the structural features of real leaf venation. Thus, in addition to its ability to efficiently transport water and nutrients, the venation network also optimizes leaf rigidity using the same hierarchical reticulated network topology. We study the phase space of optimal mechanical networks, providing concrete guidelines for the construction of elastic structures. We implement these natural design rules by fabricating efficient, biologically inspired metamaterials.

The famous Hopfield neural network (HNN) is an artificial neural network, which has been widely studied and applied. However, discrete HNNs, especially their complex dynamics and hyperchaotic attractors with complex structures, are rarely reported in the literature. To this end, this paper proposes a two-dimensional discrete model of bi-neuron HNN with sine activation functions. The fixed points with stability analysis are theoretically explored and complex dynamics with coexisting behaviors are numerically revealed. The discrete model has infinitely many fixed points and emerges various polyhedral chaotic/hyperchaotic attractors with marvelous fractal structures. Besides, using the model, we design four pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) and test their randomness by TestU01 suite. The results manifest that the PRNGs have high randomness and strong resistance to chaos degradation. Lastly, an FPGA hardware platform is developed to implement the proposed discrete model, upon which the polyhedral chaotic/hyperchaotic attractors are experimentally acquired to validate the numerical results, and two hardware PRNGs are fabricated to provide the true pseudorandom numbers (PRNs).

DTCNN templates have been given for the elemental morphological operators. One way to obtain realizations for more complex operators is cascading the DTCNN equivalences of the constituent elemental operators. Here it is shown that this straightforward mapping mostly yields a non-optimal solution with respect to the required amount of hardware. A hardware reduction scheme of morphologically designed DTCNNs is proposed, which includes the introduction of time variant templates and the identification of non-elementary expressions for which a single layer DTCNN exists.																					0-7803-3261-X				1996							339	343		10.1109/CNNA.1996.566597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1996.566597													WOS:A1996BH11L00059

The proposed method can reduce the amount of computation remarkably without deteriorating the system stability. In order to overcome the control constraints and reduce the computational burden, a nonquadratic performance index is introduced. Then, stability analysis of the event-triggered system with control constraints and an event-triggered constrained controller design algorithm are given. Three neural networks are used in the HDP scheme, which are designed to identify the unknown nonlinear system, approximate value function, and control law, respectively. In the model neural network, an effective method is developed to initialize its weights. Finally, two examples are included to demonstrate the present method.

The main objective of the CLSC is to capture values from end-of-life (EOL) products in a way that ensures a business to be economically and environmentally sustainable. The challenge is the complexity that occurrs due to closing the loop. At the same time, considering stochastic variables will increase the realism of the obtained results as well as the complexity of the model. This study aims to design a CLSC for durable products using a multistage stochastic model in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) while considering uncertainty in demand, return rate, and return quality. Demand was described by a normal distribution whereas return rate and return quality were represented by a set of discrete possible outcomes with a specific probability. The objective function was to maximize the profit in a multi-period and multi-echelon CLSC. The multistage stochastic model was tested on a real case study at an air-conditioning company. The computational results identified which facilities should be opened in the reversed loop to optimize profit. The results showed that the CLSC resulted in a reduction in purchasing costs by 52%, an annual savings of 831,150 USD, and extra annual revenue of 5459 USD from selling raw material at a material market. However, the transportation cost increased by an additional annual cost of 6457 USD, and the various recovery processes costs were annually about 152,897 USD. By running the model for nine years, the breakeven point will be after three years of establishing the CLSC and after the annual profit increases by 1.92%. In conclusion, the results of this research provide valuable analysis that may support decision-makers in supply chain planning regarding the feasibility of converting the forward chain to closed loop supply chain for durable products.

[1] propose a technique called search by objective relaxation for the local access network design problem. In this note we show that this technique can essentially be considered as a stylized branch-and-bound strategy on a mixed-integer programming formulation for the local access network design problem, wherein only a single type of facility can be installed on an edge. This provides an alternate, and somewhat simpler interpretation of their technique. Given the computational success Salman et al. have had in solving large network design problems with SOR, we examine if similar benefits are reaped with the stylized branch-and-bound strategy on the mixed-integer programming formulation. To this end we provide some computational experiments with this stylized branch-and-bound strategy, and compare it with the direct application of a state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming solver to several alternate formulations for the local access network design problem.																			1387-666X		978-0-387-29234-2				2006	33						181	201																WOS:000269923900011

A comprehensive data acquisition and management system for an ecosystem-scale peatland warming and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> experiment	GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS												Ecosystem-scale manipulation experiments represent large science investments that require well-designed data acquisition and management systems to provide reliable, accurate information to project participants and third party users. The SPRUCE project (Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change, http://mnspruce.ornl.gov) is such an experiment funded by the Department of Energy's (DOE), Office of Science, Terrestrial Ecosystem Science (TES) Program. The SPRUCE experimental mission is to assess ecosystem-level biological responses of vulnerable, high carbon terrestrial ecosystems to a range of climate warming manipulations and an elevated CO2 atmosphere. SPRUCE provides a platform for testing mechanisms controlling the vulnerability of organisms, bio-geochemical processes, and ecosystems to climatic change (e.g., thresholds for organism decline or mortality, limitations to regeneration, biogeochemical limitations to productivity, and the cycling and release of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere). The SPRUCE experiment will generate a wide range of continuous and discrete measurements. To successfully manage SPRUCE data collection, achieve SPRUCE science objectives, and support broader climate change research, the research staff has designed a flexible data system using proven network technologies and software components. The primary SPRUCE data system components are the following: 1. data acquisition and control system - set of hardware and software to retrieve biological and engineering data from sensors, collect sensor status information, and distribute feedback to control components; 2. data collection system - set of hardware and software to deliver data to a central depository for storage and further processing; 3. data management plan - set of plans, policies, and practices to control consistency, protect data integrity, and deliver data. This publication presents our approach to meeting the challenges of designing and constructing an efficient data system for managing high volume sources of in situ observations in a remote, harsh environmental location. The approach covers data flow starting from the sensors and ending at the archival/distribution points, discusses types of hardware and software used, examines design considerations that were used to choose them, and describes the data management practices chosen to control and enhance the value of the data.

A controller is designed through a novel recursive design procedure, under which the dependence on virtual controls is avoided and only system states are needed. The numbers of the event-triggered conditions and parameters updated online in each subsystem reduce to only one, which largely reduces the computation burden and simplifies the algorithm realization. In this case, radial basis function NNs (RBFNNs) are employed to approximate the control input. The semiglobal uniformly ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) of all the signals in the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov difference approach.

To overcome the noncausal problem, which has been known to be a major obstacle in the discrete-time control design, both systems are transformed to a predictor for output feedback control design. Implicit function theorem is used to overcome the difficulty of the nonaffine appearance of the control input. The problem of lacking a priori knowledge on the control directions is solved by using discrete Nussbaum gain. The high-order neural network (HONN) is employed to approximate the unknown control. The closed-loop system achieves semiglobal uniformly-ultimately-bounded (SGUUB) stability and the output tracking error is made within a neighborhood around zero. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.

We introduce a new discrete-time approach to analyze the performance of handoff algorithms based on pilot signal strength measurements. We derive exact analytical expressions and develop a recursive numerical procedure to evaluate handoff performance metrics for a mobile station moving along a straight-line trajectory in a cellular network employing hard handoff. The numerical procedure provides a computational solution to a level-crossing problem in discrete time. Our discrete-time approach provides valuable analytical insight into the performance impact of handoff algorithms. Moreover, our numerical procedure for discrete-time handoff analysis provides an accurate and efficient tool for the design and dimensioning of high-performance handoff algorithms. The accuracy of the numerical procedure is validated by simulation.																			1536-1276	1558-2248				SEP	2004	3	5					1721	1733		10.1109/TWC.2004.833480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2004.833480													WOS:000224496200046

The budget is from the allocation of funds in phases and the construction cost change in the process of the construction. The general static transportation network design problems ignores the problems above. So the optimal solution obtained by the static model is best in short time, and it is may be unfeasible in the actual situation. Based on the actual situation and the shortage of the static model, the time-dependent transport network design is proposed in this study. The plan horizon is divided into N intervals and a bi-level model is built to describe the problem. The objective of the upper-level is to minimize the total cost of the whole stages. the lower-level model is a user equilibrium model. Then the branch and bound (B-B) algorithm is designed to solve the model. It is obvious that the solution of the time-dependent simulation model is more feasible than the solution of the static sequential design.

Heat exchanger network synthesis using a stagewise superstructure with non-isothermal mixing	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Much work on heat exchanger network synthesis (HENS) via mathematical programming has employed a stagewise superstructure with the assumption of isothermal mixing. It is well known that the superstructure may miss potentially better networks. In this article, we propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming formulation and a solution strategy to incorporate non-isothermal mixing in HENS. We use an existing modification of the stagewise superstructure, propose novel and improved temperature bounds, and propose logical constraints to obtain superior HENs. Using several examples, we show that our approach finds superior networks compared to those known in the literature, especially for larger and more difficult problems. Furthermore, we propose exact approaches for handling log-mean temperature difference (LMTD) without numerical difficulty, and compare the effectiveness of the known LMTD approximations. We also show that including the stage bypass variables and constraints improves solution quality and efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study modeled the structural balance of social networks as a mathematical optimization problem by using swarm intelligence, and an efficient discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm was proposed to solve the modeled optimization problem. To take advantage of the topologies of social networks in the algorithm design, the discrete representation of the particle was redefined, and the discrete particle update principles were redesigned. To validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, experiments were conducted using synthetic and real-world social networks. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves a balanced social network structure, but also automatically detects the community topology of networks.					hui, zhang/HZJ-4420-2023; Hui, Zhang/JWQ-0400-2024														1311-9702	1314-4081					2015	15	2					23	35		10.1515/cait-2015-0026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cait-2015-0026													WOS:000360812800002

It is extensively believed that real-world networks, especially social networks, are fast mixing with their mixing time at most O(log N) where N is the number of vertices. However, the behavior of mixing time in the real-life networks has not been examined carefully, and exactly analytical research for mixing time in models mimicking real networks is still lacking. In this paper, we first experimentally evaluate the mixing time of various real-world networks with scale-free small-world properties and show that their mixing time is much higher than anticipated. To better understand the behavior of the mixing time for real-world networks, we then analytically study the mixing time of the Apollonian network, which is simultaneously scale-free and small-world. To this end, we derive the recursive relations for all eigenvalues, especially the second largest eigenvalue modulus of the transition matrix, based on which we deduce a lower bound for the mixing time of the Apollonian network, which approximately scales sublinearly with N. Our results indicate that real-world networks are not always fast mixing, which has potential implications in the design of algorithms related to mixing time.

J	Chen, WH; Chen, YF; Zheng, WX				Chen, Wu-Hua; Chen, Yufan; Zheng, Wei Xing			Variable Gain Impulsive Synchronization for Discrete-Time Delayed Neural Networks and Its Application in Digital Secure Communication	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												This article revisits the problems of impulsive stabilization and impulsive synchronization of discrete-time delayed neural networks (DDNNs) in the presence of disturbance in the input channel. A new Lyapunov approach based on double Lyapunov functionals is introduced for analyzing exponential input-to-state stability (EISS) of discrete impulsive delayed systems. In the framework of double Lyapunov functionals, a pair of timer-dependent Lyapunov functionals are constructed for impulsive DDNNs. The pair of Lyapunov functionals can introduce more degrees of freedom that not only can be exploited to reduce the conservatism of the previous methods, but also make it possible to design variable gain impulsive controllers. New design criteria for impulsive stabilization and impulsive synchronization are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical results show that compared with the constant gain design technique, the proposed variable gain design technique can accept larger impulse intervals and equip the impulsive controllers with a stronger disturbance attenuation ability. Applications to digital signal encryption and image encryption are provided which validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

The proposed algorithm keeps fast convergence speed and strong adaptability features of the particle swarm optimization. In addition, it updates an elite set to achieve multi-objective decision-making. Meanwhile, a mutation operator is adopted to make the algorithm converge to the global optimal.

Unlike existing models, the optimization frameworks can determine the optimal designs automatically without trial-and-error once the objective(s) is/are clearly defined. Moreover, these frameworks allow the evaluation of the impacts of the optimal designs on the related parties including landowners, toll road operators, transit operators, and road users, and help network planners and profit-makers with decision making by eliminating many alternative designs. A numerical study is set up to examine road network design's effects on these related parties under three road construction schemes: exact cost recovery, build-operate-transfer, and cross-subsidization. The results show that the changes in landowner profits are not the same after implementing any scheme. These unequal changes raise the issue of the landowner equity. This implies that the government has to consider trade-offs between parties' objectives carefully.					; Szeto, W.Y./E-9886-2010	O'Mahony, Margaret/0000-0002-8647-0091; Szeto, W.Y./0000-0001-7059-3532													1093-9687	1467-8667				AUG	2010	25	6					411	426		10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00654.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00654.x													WOS:000278933600003

The stability conditions for nonlinear sampled-data systems are extended to the time-delay situations, which can guarantee stability of networked control systems when delay and data packet dropout may take place. For these systems, the controller can be designed based on Euler approximation, while the stability can be guaranteed with fast sampling and suitable hardware and software configuration, which control the delay time and data packet dropout.																					978-1-4503-6512-3				2018										10.1145/3207677.3278102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3207677.3278102													WOS:000455679900049

The SGA uses only selection and recombination operators rather than mutation. The UE-DNDP approach proposed in this study has a bilevel structure: the upper-level problem relates to the strategy of the network design authority, and the lower-level problem deals with network user behaviors. To solve the upper-level problem, the SGA is first used to create feasible network design solutions to the UE-DNDP by accounting for a budget constraint. Then the design authority selects the best network design strategy with minimum total system travel time (TSTT). Extensive experimental design and testing on GA operators and parameters are conducted to select the useful GA operators and parameters. For the lower-level problem, the best K-value concept is introduced to reduce the computational effort by allowing only a few best K-design solutions with best fitness values among the feasible network design solutions to the UE network evaluation model. The study uses statistical analysis to validate whether the proposed SGA-based UE-DNDP model is working well. The results of numerical analysis have shown that the proposed solution search procedure could significantly improve computational efficiency without loss of solution quality in terms of TSTT.

In this paper, we provide an energy-saving audio data compression technique for such a network using lifting based partial discrete wavelet transform (PDWT). Unlike existing implementation of such a lifting based PDWT, we exploit both spatial and temporal correlation of data together, with an objective to save energy while achieving acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We subsequently design a tree based routing scheme and an encoding scheme to be used with the proposed compression scheme with a target to reduce energy further. Finally, the design feasibility along with simulation results, including statistical analysis is presented to evaluate efficacy of the scheme in terms of two conflicting parameters viz, energy consumption and SNR.

Using a linear problem formulation, the procedure uses network linear programming as a subproblem that assumes the knowledge of design variables. Since inside its domain, the global objective functions is a convex piecewise linear function, a subgradient method is used to obtain the direction of the improvement of design variables at each iteration using the solutions of the network subproblem. The mixed technique permits an efficient evaluation of the design variables in order to reach a good approximation of the global objective function optimum. The solution technique performs well in the purely linear case and, moreover, allows some kinds of nonlinearities in the cost functions of design variables.

Deep Task-Based Analog-to-Digital Conversion	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING												Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) allow physical signals to be processed using digital hardware. Their conversion consists of two stages: Sampling, which maps a continuous-time signal into discrete-time, and quantization, i.e., representing the continuous-amplitude quantities using a finite number of bits. ADCs typically implement generic uniform conversion mappings that are ignorant of the task for which the signal is acquired, and can be costly when operating in high rates and fine resolutions. In this work we design task-oriented ADCs which learn from data how to map an analog signal into a digital representation such that the system task can be efficiently carried out. We propose a model for sampling and quantization that facilitates the learning of non-uniform mappings from data. Based on this learnable ADC mapping, we present a mechanism for optimizing a hybrid acquisition system comprised of analog combining, tunable ADCs with fixed rates, and digital processing, by jointly learning its components end-to-end. Then, we show how one can exploit the representation of hybrid acquisition systems as deep networks to optimize the sampling and quantization rates given the task by utilizing Bayesian meta-learning techniques. We evaluate the proposed deep task-based ADC in two case studies: the first considers synthetic multi-variate symbol detection, where multiple analog signals are simultaneously acquired in order to recover a set of discrete symbols. The second application is beamforming of analog channel data acquired in ultrasound imaging. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves performance which is comparable to operating with high sampling rates and fine resolution quantization, while operating with reduced overall bit rate. For instance, we demonstrate that deep task-based ADCs enable accurate reconstruction of ultrasound images while using 12.5% of the overall number of bits used by conventional ADCs.					van Sloun, Ruud/AGX-0436-2022; Shlezinger, Nir/HZL-5269-2023; WANG, SHUAI/E-3378-2019	van Sloun, Ruud/0000-0003-2845-0495; Shlezinger, Nir/0000-0003-2234-929X; Luijten, Ben/0000-0002-1797-8721; Amar, Ariel/0000-0002-2993-2640; Eldar, Yonina/0000-0003-4358-5304													1053-587X	1941-0476					2022	70						6021	6034		10.1109/TSP.2022.3229947	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2022.3229947													WOS:000912370800001

An aperiodically intermittent control strategy based on discrete-time state observations (aperiodically intermittent discrete-time state observations control for short) is designed. Different from intermittent control strategies referred in existing literatures, the control duration of the control strategy used in this article is based on discrete-time state observations, which makes the control used in this article somewhat less demanding and more effective. Under the aperiodically intermittent discrete-time state observations control strategy, a valid approach combining Lyapunov method with graph theory is proposed in this article. Throughout this article, a theorem and a corollary to the quasi-synchronization criterion of fuzzy heterogeneous complex networks are established.

Tandem Neural Network Based Design of Multiband Antennas	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION												We present a deep neural network-based framework for designing multiband microstrip antennas given a desired impedance matching spectrum. The approach enables a design methodology that generates the desired antenna structures rapidly (under a second) through an effective deep learning-enabled search of a large design space and eliminates the need for extensive domain knowledge of antenna design. The framework is built on our innovations in tandem neural networks consisting of two cascaded neural networks. Our structures are parameterized in an exponentially large design space of discrete variables (pixels), leading to the realization of nonintuitive structures. This end-to-end synthesis in terms of discrete variables is enabled by introducing a new type of "smooth thresholding" (ST) activation function, which, along with crucial regularization terms in the network loss function, aids in designing our structures. We perform extensive neural network optimizations and study various trade-offs in the design process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by generating single and dual-band resonant structures, which can be up to 50% more compact in terms of area, and up to 18% thinner in terms of substrate height than conventional structures, while retaining competitive performance parameters in terms of gain, polarization properties, radiation efficiency (RE), and fractional bandwidth (FBW).

A diversity-enriched variant of discrete PSO applied to the design of water distribution networks	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												The design of water distribution networks (WDNs) is addressed by using a variant of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. This variant, which makes use of a discrete version of PSO already considered by the authors, overcomes one of the PSO's main drawbacks, namely its difficulty in maintaining acceptable levels of population diversity and in balancing local and global searches.

J	Shin, DH; Kim, Y				Shin, Dong-Ho; Kim, Youdan			Nonlinear discrete-time reconfigurable flight control law using neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY												A neural-network-based adaptive reconfigurable flight controller is presented for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems. The objective of the controller is to make the angle of attack, sideslip angle, and bank angle follow a given desired trajectory in the presence of control surface damage and aerodynamic uncertainties. The adaptive discrete-time nonlinear controller is developed using the backstepping technique and feedback linearization. Feedforward multilayer neural networks (NNs) are augmented to guarantee consistent performance when the effectiveness of the control decreases due to control surface damage. NNs learn through the recursive weight update rules that are derived from the discrete-time version of Lyapunov control theory. The boundness property of the error states and NN weight estimation errors is also investigated by the discrete-time Lyapunov analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is demonstrated by applying it to a nonlinear dynamic model of the high-performance aircraft.

Joint Physical Layer and Data Link Layer Optimization of CDMA-Based Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												In CDMA systems, outer loop power control (OLPC) determines the target value of SNR at the receiver, mostly by using look-up tables to map bit error rates (BERs) to SNR-targets. In this contribution, transmission delay and packet loss rate constraints in the data link layer (DLL) are invoked in order to determine the optimum outer loop SNRtarget setpoint analytically, according to the number of active users in cell. Optimality is, in this sense, the maximization of system throughput. Using the optimum SNR-target, the optimal spreading factor is determined. Subsequently, the joint optimization of outer loop SNR-target and variable spreading factor (VSF), at the physical(PHY)-layer, with truncated automatic repeat request (ARQ) error control mechanism at the data link layer are proposed. Hence, we show that quality of service (QoS) requirements at these layers can be simultaneously satisfied while maximizing throughput. Total and truncated channel inversion strategies are employed in the inner loop to adapt transmit power to short-time channel variations. We propose a system where the number of users in a cell is modeled by a one-dimensional discrete Markov chain, and design the adaptive continuous power and rate mechanism for the worst case packet error rate (PER) condition. The corresponding theoretical throughput, which can be regarded as upper-bound for discrete spreading factor case, is obtained numerically for various settings of system parameters. We have also provided simulation results for a practical channel condition. Our scheme is compared with 'constant SNR-target` and ` PHY-layer based variable SNR-target' cases under continuous power and rate variation to show the achievable gain through the coupling of physical and data link layers parameters.

The derived approach can effectively deal with network-induced delay, data packet dropout and data packet disorder simultaneously, and also leads to a novel model for networked control systems. This model offers the designer the freedom of designing different controllers with respect to specific network conditions, which is distinct from previous results and is expected to result in better performance. By applying switched system theory, the stability criterion for the closed-loop system is obtained. A numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach is also presented.

First, to eliminate the delay term of control input, a time-delay matrix function is developed by designing a M network. Furthermore, the cost function is approximated by the critic NN, and the control signal can be obtained directly by using the information of critic NN according to the equilibrium condition. In addition, to shorten the learning time and reduce the computational burden in the control process, a novel control strategy with less adjustable parameters for the time-delay DT nonlinear systems is proposed in this article, in which the norm of the weight estimations of critic NN is updated to generate a novel long-term performance function. The proposed control algorithm using adaptive critic designs has the advantage of reducing adaptive learning parameters and lessening calculative burden. The Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the time-delay DT controlled systems can be uniformly ultimately bounded stable. Finally, three simulations are presented to demonstrate the control performance of the developed method.																			0143-2087	1099-1514				MAY	2020	41	3					748	764		10.1002/oca.2567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/oca.2567		FEB 2020											WOS:000514538600001

Each complementarity constraint requires the product of a pair of nonnegative variables to be zero. Instead of dealing with this type of constraints directly, the proposed algorithm assigns one of the nonnegative variables in each pair a value of zero. Doing so reduces the design problem to a regular nonlinear program. Using the multipliers associated with the constraints forcing nonnegative variables to be zero, the algorithm then constructs and solves binary knapsack problems to make changes to the zero-value assignments in order to improve the system delay. Numerical experiments with data from networks in the literature indicate that the algorithm is effective and has the potential for solving larger network design problems.																					978-1-4419-0819-3				2009							283	300		10.1007/978-1-4419-0820-9_14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-0820-9_14													WOS:000273561800014

It has reached to point wherein a well established theory as well as implementation reports are available in the literature. Advances in computer communication network with wired and wireless configurations have imposed a challenging problem for control community. The response of such system is very fast and fast acting controller needs to be designed. At the same time such system uses inherent switching of data packets and routes. Hence, it has been found interesting to use inherent switching like control, a sliding mode control for such networks. The paper explores the utilization of discrete sliding mode control approach for the congestion control in communication network. For the past several years many feedback control methods have been used for the control of various parameters of Communication Networks like Traffic Control, Congestion Control and Power Control. The work presented here proposes a new application of sliding mode control for congestion control in communication network. As computer communication networks deals with digital data and are inherently discrete in nature, the discrete sliding mode control has been applied to discrete time system. The bit rate has been kept constant and buffer length has been controlled for control of congestion. The buffer length has been kept at maximum of 250 bits for simulation and analysis purpose. Thus, it has been shown that the discrete sliding mode control can be used in control of various parameters of communication network.

Energy-Efficient Data Aggregation in Low-Power Wireless Networks With Sensors of Discrete Transmission Ranges: A Mathematical Framework for Network Design	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												The advancements in sensor technology and the evolution of new generation technologies such as the Internet of Things have led to extensive deployment of low-power wireless sensor networks for various surveillance and monitoring applications. The volume and velocity of the data generated by a large number of sensors and monitors used in such applications are huge. The harnessing of such Big Data is critical to the real-time control of underlying real-world processes. Future generation networks favor the deployment of sensors with different discrete transmission ranges. Such multiple transmission ranges introduce different connectivity constraints in the network. Advanced strategies are under investigation for designing energy-efficient data aggregation schemes in such connectivity-constrained networks. To aid such works, we introduce a mathematical framework that captures the salient features of low-power networks with sensors of multiple transmission ranges. The proposed framework can serve as a baseline platform to investigate different networking problems in such systems. Further, we consider a cluster-based multihop network with fixed intra-cluster and inter-cluster transmission ranges and address the problem of designing an optimal network configuration for minimizing the data transmission in the network. We model the problem as an integer linear program, which can be applied only to networks of small sizes because of the hardness of the problem. To address the problem in large-scale networks, we design a polynomial-time approximation method using the proposed mathematical framework. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated under compression schemes based on compressive sensing.

In particular, we shall consider the case when the signal processing problem is complex, and a multi-layered CNN with time-variant templates is necessary. The method originates from the existence of a correspondence between the cloning templates of Cellular Neural Network and its discrete counterpart, Discrete-Time Cellular Neural Network (DTCNN), in solving a prescribed image processing problem when time-variant templates are involved. Thus, one can start with calculating the cloning templates from DTCNN, and then translating the cloning templates to those for CNN operations. As a result, the mathematical tools being used in the synthesis of Discrete-time Cellular Neural Network can also be applied to the analog type Cellular Neural Network. This inevitably helps to simplify the design problem of CNN for signal processing. Examples akin to contour drawing and parallel thinning are shown to illustrate the merits of our proposed method.																			0916-8532					APR	1994	E77D	4					433	442																WOS:A1994NH67100010

Such devices can present information or give recommendations, so they have influence on the travelers travel choice in the traffic network. In this sense, the influence of guidance system on travelers' route choice should be considered when the scenario of traffic network design is developed. However, few of existing traffic network design problem model considers the effect, and this motivates us to develop a Continuous Network Design (CNDP) model under a traffic network with guidance system. This study is based on the research of Jahn et al. (2005) to develop a single level program for CNDP under the traffic network with guidance system. The guidance system give advices to travelers based on system optimal rules with user constrains. From the result of simulation, it can be inferred that if the tolerance factor phi is properly chosen in our CNDP model, travelers all can decrease their travel time after network design than that they experienced at user equilibrium before network enhancement. That is to say, every traveler can profit from our CNDP scenario for proper tolerance factor phi. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Compared with traditional octo-linear maps, CC maps can effectively simplify the perception of a network by visually accenting circular line patterns. This design offers new insights into the schematic drawing of metro systems that can improve map readability and engagement. Automated mapping studies in the literature have mostly applied the traditional octo-linear design using optimization methods, where design criteria are modeled as constraints and/or objective functions in a constrained mixed-integer optimization program, whereas the automated CC map drawing approach has received less attention.

The definitions of security and insecurity are presented and the injection attack is considered in a discrete nonlinear system. The contribution of this study is twofold: 1) two kinds of iterative learning schemes are designed to be with the partial information and delay due to limited bandwidth of networks and 2) two criteria are proposed to analyze the security and insecurity of a discrete nonlinear system with the two kinds of iterative learning schemes.

The objective function in upper-level model was to make the sum of total impedance and total investment budget minimal in a traffic network. The lower-level model was a user equilibrium assignment model with fixed demand. In order to make the results more realistic, this paper proposed an improved model with stochastic transportation network design, and presented genetic algorithm and Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm to find optimal solution. Then a specific network example was given to prove the effectiveness of the model. The results show that an optimal value of existing links capacities for the formulation can be obtained and it can minimize the sum of total impedance and investment budget, which can provide a reasonable reference for the decision-makers.

Both extended continuous Class-F and continuous Class-F-1 are engaged to expand the design space for the ultra-broad operating band. A wideband vertex coupled radial stubs (VCRS) low-pass filter alongside a transmission line network (TLN) is proposed as an output impedance matching network of the PA. The wide rejection band and sharp transition band of this filter make it suitable for harmonic tuning PAs. To verify the feasibility of the proposed structure, the PA is fabricated and its performance is measured.

J	Garnett, F; Ecclesfield, N				Garnett, Fred; Ecclesfield, Nigel			Towards a framework for co-creating Open Scholarship	RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY												A recent edition of ALT-J made a call for papers that looked at 'theoretical approaches in digitally mediated environments'. A key part of this call was to use the Boyer Model of Scholarship as a frame of reference. The authors felt that there were limitations to this model which could be addressed in light of the recent moves to develop Open Scholarship. Our concern with Boyer is that he suggests a separation between researchers, who 'build new knowledge through traditional research' and teachers who 'study teaching models and practices to achieve optimal learning'. Boyer identifies four 'Types' of Scholarship, those of Discovery, Integration, Application and Teaching (DIAT), but places the responsibility for 'creative work in established field', with the traditional researcher role (Discovery). Furthermore this model implies a linear flow concerning how new knowledge becomes a part of teaching, implying that the teaching is mostly instructional, with a limited view of how new and emerging pedagogies might be utilised. The Learner-Generated Contexts Research Group has been concerned to develop a co-creation approach to learning and find this separation curious. We argue that using the Pedagogy, Andragogy, Heutagogy (PAH) Continuum enables more flexible approaches, through a mix of PAH, allowing for a wide range of technology uses, which also changes the relationship to research. We look at how we might both apply a co-creation approach to Boyer's model, inspired by the Open Scholar movement, and also make DIAT more iterative and less discrete. Consequently we have both extended Boyer's DIAT system to include Co-creating as an additional type and changed some 'measures of performance' to enable an iterative process of scholarship to emerge which also involves learners. We also examine how network effects 'enable generative network effects to occur' on scholarship and how applying Epistemic Cognition to evolving subject frameworks might enable the co-creation of research agendas. The co-creation model of Open Scholarship is presented in a table designed to simulate debate on this subject.																			2156-7069	2156-7077					2011	19			1					7795	10.3402/rlt.v19s1/7795	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/rlt.v19s1/7795													WOS:000210130100002

In addition to serving general public customers, they are extensively used in the electric power industry for electricity information acquisition and distribution automation telemetry, as well as other non-control-related businesses. Simultaneously, power grid companies are actively studying and deploying electric power wireless private networks for bearing high-security control-related businesses such as distribution grid dispatching and distributed energy control. Electric power wireless private networks utilize dedicated spectrum resources, which operate on narrow individual carrier channels with numerous carriers in a discrete manner. These spectral characteristics indicate that electric power wireless private networks require unique system designs that are different from those of commercial cellular networks. Although some proposals have been proposed in relevant research, a unified and mature technical specification for electric power wireless private networks has not yet been established. This paper introduces the development history of electric power wireless private networks and power grid business requirements, with a specific emphasis on system design and key technologies, including frame structure and numerology, massive discrete carrier aggregation, spectrum sensing, security and isolation. We presented a comprehensive analysis and suggestions for these key technologies. Finally, we discuss future research on technological evolution. This study offers indications for an electric power wireless private network ecosystem.

J	Habibi, M; Beyranvand, H				Habibi, Mehdi; Beyranvand, Hamzeh			Reducing blocking probability and QoT violation in dynamic elastic optical networks via load-aware margin selection	COMPUTER NETWORKS												In this paper, we study the effect of load-aware margin selection on the performance of elastic optical networks (EONs) in dynamic service provisioning. First, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is proposed as a benchmark for dynamic routing, modulation level, spectrum, and power assignment (RMSPA). In this formulation, nonlinear interferences (NLIs) in optical fibers and the noise of amplifiers are considered. In addition, a margin which is calculated based on the network load is considered to estimate the additional noise which may degrade the signal quality of transmission (QoT) during its life time. The objective of this formulation is to minimize the spectrum usage and impairments of/from the signal which is optimized by choosing the optimum channel among a number of pre-calculated channels based on the QoT constraints. In order to reduce the RMSPA run time, heuristic algorithms are also proposed. The algorithms employ K -least weighted paths for routing. The defined weights are distance, the amount of traffic load, and a mixture scheme. Furthermore, the algorithms try to minimize the spectrum usage by choosing the highest possible modulation level while considering a specific criterion. The assumed criteria are: i) choosing the lowest possible power spectral density (PSD) in a discrete set, ii) selecting the optimum power among the set, iii) obtaining maximum SNR. We simulated the proposed algorithms and the MILP, and compared their performances on NSFNET and US Backbone topologies. The results reveal that the constrained best SNR scheme has the best performance among the heuristics and its performance is close to MILP, especially in higher loads. Moreover, results show that considering the links congestion leads to blocking reduction. We also simulated the first-fit based algorithms without considering NLIs which assign the modulation based on: i) considering only amplifier noise and self-channel interference (SCI), ii) experimental distance thresholds, and iii) overestimating the NLI. The results imply that the proposed MILP and heuristic algorithms outperform the other algorithms in terms of the summation of outage (probability of QoT violation) and blocking probability.					beyranvand, Hamzeh/ADX-6125-2022	Habibi, Mehdi/0000-0002-4033-6671													1389-1286	1872-7069				SEP 4	2022	214								109146	10.1016/j.comnet.2022.109146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2022.109146		JUL 2022											WOS:000829869100009

The plant under the transmission constraint is first formulated as a mixed logical dynamical system, then model predictive control (MPC) based on the mixed-integer programming is applied to derive the controller. It is shown that the non-convexity feature of this class of networked control systems rules out piecewise affine controllers that are designable for linear convex problems. Nevertheless, controller design is still feasible due to the special nature of the data transmission strategy, i.e., only a small number of logic values is involved. An example is given to illustrate the strength of the proposed approach.

The event-triggered strategy is used to save the limited network bandwidth. Then, based on the zero-order-hold (ZOH) measurement, a state observer is designed to reconstruct the system state, which facilitates the design of the discrete-time sliding surface. Considering the effects of quantizations, networked-induced constraints and event-triggered scheme, the nonlinear state error dynamics and sliding mode dynamics are converted into a unified linear parameter varying (LPV) time-delay system with the aid of a reformulated Lipschitz property. By using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and free weighting matrix, a new sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the robust asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system with prescribed H-infinity, performance. And then the observer gain, event-triggering parameter and sliding mode parameter are co-designed. Furthermore, a novel SMC law is synthesized to force the trajectories of the observer system onto a pre-specified sliding mode region in a finite time. Finally, a single-link flexible joint robot example is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

System design and evaluation of coupled ensemble data assimilation for global oceanic climate studies	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A fully coupled data assimilation (CDA) system, consisting of an ensemble filter applied to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's global fully coupled climate model (CM2), has been developed to facilitate the detection and prediction of seasonal-to-multidecadal climate variability and climate trends. The assimilation provides a self-consistent, temporally continuous estimate of the coupled model state and its uncertainty, in the form of discrete ensemble members, which can be used directly to initialize probabilistic climate forecasts. Here, the CDA is evaluated using a series of perfect model experiments, in which a particular twentieth-century simulation-with temporally varying greenhouse gas and natural aerosol radiative forcings-serves as a "truth" from which observations are drawn, according to the actual ocean observing network for the twentieth century. These observations are then assimilated into a coupled model ensemble that is subjected only to preindustrial forcings. By examining how well this analysis ensemble reproduces the "truth," the skill of the analysis system in recovering anthropogenically forced trends and natural climate variability is assessed, given the historical observing network. The assimilation successfully reconstructs the twentieth-century ocean heat content variability and trends in most locations. The experiments highlight the importance of maintaining key physical relationships among model fields, which are associated with water masses in the ocean and geostrophy in the atmosphere. For example, when only oceanic temperatures are assimilated, the ocean analysis is greatly improved by incorporating the temperature-salinity covariance provided by the analysis ensemble. Interestingly, wind observations are more helpful than atmospheric temperature observations for constructing the structure of the tropical atmosphere; the opposite holds for the extratropical atmosphere. The experiments indicate that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is difficult to constrain using the twentieth-century observational network, but there is hope that additional observations-including those from the newly deployed Argo profiles-may lessen this problem in the twenty-first century. The challenges for data assimilation of model systematic biases and evolving observing systems are discussed.

This consists of the initial individual design, the rematching design and the final overall design. Firstly, for every time interval, the conventional methods for continuous processes can be used directly to develop the initial individual designs. Based on the information provided by this design, the second individual designs are then performed by focusing on the optimal rematching of streams for maximum use of the common exchangers. Finally, the overall design is obtained through some adjustments of area, energy exchanged and configuration of the HEN for further optimization of the whole system. The information on rematching is obtained by solving an MILP model-the transshipment model developed specifically for batch/semi-continuous processes. A case study is provided to demonstrate the design procedure and its effectiveness.																			0263-8762					SEP	1998	76	A6					700	710		10.1205/026387698525405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1205/026387698525405													WOS:000076230300006

The controller design problemfor this class of control system can be formulated as the construction of a mapping between the observed outputs and the discrete inputs, that is, the construction of a switching surface. The mapping can be learned by neural network; however, the training result is sensitive to the initial weights, especially when a redundant structure of the network is selected. In this paper, a controller design method based on a neural network with autoencoder is discussed. An autoencoder learns the identity mapping at each layer. As a result, the output from each layer automatically encodes the feature vectors. The trained weight is used as a suitable initial weight for overall supervised learning. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method can reduce stochastic variance and avoid overfitting, especially for redundant neural controllers.

Despite the prominent success achieved by the neural network, it still lacks theoretical guidance to design an efficient neural network model, and verifying the performance of a model needs excessive resources. Previous research studies have demonstrated that many existing models can be regarded as different numerical discretizations of differential equations. This connection sheds light on designing an effective recurrent neural network (RNN) by resorting to numerical analysis. Simple RNN is regarded as a discretisation of the forward Euler scheme. Considering the limited solution accuracy of the forward Euler methods, a Taylor-type discrete scheme is presented with lower truncation error and a Taylor-type RNN (T-RNN) is designed with its guidance. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate its performance on statistical language models and emotion analysis tasks. The noticeable gains obtained by T-RNN present its superiority and the feasibility of designing the neural network model using numerical methods.					wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023														2468-6557	2468-2322				DEC	2023	8	4					1415	1424		10.1049/cit2.12172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/cit2.12172		JAN 2023											WOS:000919844300001

In this paper we design and implement Mix-MobGen, a mobility, generator for ad hoc vehicular applications, which takes into account mixed vehicular conditions. This is the first mobility model that takes into account, both, slow and fast vehicles. While speed for highway traffic has been modeled following a normal distribution, two studies on the mixed traffic show that speed follows a multimodal or bimodal distribution, instead.

With the bandwidth-intensive services such as High Definition TV over IPTV, online gaming, high speed Internet, etc., the deployment of FTTx networks is probably one of the best choices to deliver the required services. However, designs of FTTx networks are typically created manually. Quality of designs often varies based on the planners' experience. Complexity and time constraints make it impossible for the planners to produce an optimal design. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach is proposed to demonstrate how this technique can be applied to automate the FTTH designs, hence reducing the capital expenditure (CAPEX) of telecoms companies. Different network examples illustrating optimal or near optimal placement of network elements such as splitters and distribution points and cable assignments for different network elements will be provided.

According to the approach, a neural network ARMAX (NN-ARMAX) model of the system is identified and continuously updated, using an online training algorithm. Control design is accomplished by solving an optimal discrete-time linear quadratic tracking problem using an observer-type linear state-space Kalman innovation model, which is built from the parameters of a local linear version of the NN-ARMAX model. The state-feedback control law is implemented using the Kalman state, which is calculated without estimating the noise covariance properties. The proposed control approach is shown to be very effective and outperforms the self-tuning control approach based on a linear ARMAX model on two simulation examples.																			0020-7721						2010	41	12					1421	1435	PII 928292926	10.1080/00207720903353583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207720903353583													WOS:000283314600002

We optimize simultaneously the network architecture and the link dimensioning under discrete cost functions in order to route all traffic demands in line with traffic growth over a discrete time horizon. We are interested here in incremental routing, that is, routing paths used at a given period to route sonic traffic demands have to be preserved over subsequent periods. We present here some new valid inequalities related to multi-period incremental routing, in addition to some previous results already presented in [13]. Finally some computational results for a range of instances with eight and ten nodes for two and three periods are given. They provide a comparison of the classical MPND problem and the MPND/problem in terms of overall costs and CPU time.																			1530-1346		978-1-4244-1520-5				2007							995	1000																WOS:000253439700148

Piezoelectric Actuator and Sensor Networks for Active Control of Continuous Structures	PROCEEDINGS OF THE TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGY	Civil-Comp Proceedings				10th International Conference on Computational Structures Technology	SEP 14-17, 2010	Valencia, SPAIN					In the present paper active control of continuous structures using piezoelectric actuator and sensor networks is studied. The well known method of dynamic shape control is first discussed for the case of continuously distributed strain induced actuators. Here, one computes an actuation that can exactly elliminate force induced vibrations for the case the external forces are known. In case only the spatial distribution of the forces is known, the concept of collocated sensing is introduced. As in many practical problems the continuous actuation/sensing has to be replaced by actuator and sensor networks, we discuss this latter topic in some detail. In particular, optimal design of such networks is considered. It is shown that the effectiveness of active (both feedforward and feedback) control strongly depends on the accurate approximation of continuous actuators and sensors by the corresponding networks.

Firstly, a sufficient admissibility criterion is presented to guarantee that the augmented fuzzy jump neural network without parameter uncertainties is stochastically finite-time bounded in a prescribed time interval. From the admissibility criterion obtained, a sufficient condition on stochastic finite-time boundedness is provided for the augmented fuzzy jump neural networks. Then, a sufficient criterion to design a finite-time fuzzy filter is presented with uncertain parameters and Markovian jumps for discrete time-delay fuzzy neural networks. Moreover, conditions on stochastic finite time stability are also established for nominal and uncertain delayed fuzzy jump neural networks without the presence of external disturbance. All criteria obtained can be represented as the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

J	Dhar, A; Datta, B				Dhar, Anirban; Datta, Bithin			Global Optimal design of Ground Water Monitoring Network Using Embedded Kriging	GROUND WATER												We present a methodology for global optimal design of ground water quality monitoring networks using a linear mixed-integer formulation. The proposed methodology incorporates ordinary kriging (OK) within the decision model formulation for spatial estimation of contaminant concentration values. Different monitoring network design models incorporating concentration estimation error, variance estimation error, mass estimation error, error in locating plume centroid, and spatial coverage of the designed network are developed. A big-M technique is used for reformulating the monitoring network design model to a linear decision model while incorporating different objectives and OK equations. Global optimality of the solutions obtained for the monitoring network design can be ensured due to the linear mixed-integer programming formulations proposed.

J	Gang, C; Hua, T; Wei, X; Wei, Z				Gang, Chen; Hua, Tian; Wei, Xie; Wei, Zhong			Joint Network Selection and Discrete Power Control in Heterogeneous MIMO Networks: A Game Theoretical Approach	FREQUENZ												Next-generation wireless networks will integrate multiple wireless access technologies and the users will access the network using one of several available radio access technologies. In this paper, we study the spectrum access problem in heterogeneous multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks through a game theoretic approach. The spectrum access problem in the considered system model is defined as joint network selection and discrete power control. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game where the players are the multi-mode terminals and. The proposed common utility function takes both transmission rate and the power consumption into account. This game is shown to be a potential game which possess at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) and the optimal strategy profile which maximizes the total energy efficiency of the heterogeneous MIMO network constitutes a pure strategy NE of our proposed game. Furthermore, we prove that the price of anarchy of the proposed game is equal to 1. In order to achieve the pure strategy NE, we design an iterative spectrum access algorithm. The convergence and the complexity of our designed algorithm is discussed. It is shown that the designed algorithm can achieve optimal performance with low complexity.

Discrete-time neural synchronization between an Arduino microcontroller and a Compact Development System using multiscroll chaotic signals	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS												In this paper, we present the synchronization of a chaotic system using a discrete-time recurrent high order neural network. This is done by using a Genesio & Tesi oscillator circuit in discrete-time embedded into an Arduino microcontroller that provides the state space variables. A discrete-time recurrent neural network is designed to synchronize the dynamics of the chaotic oscillator. This neural network is trained using a time-varying training algorithm where it is used the Extended Kalman Filter. Two state space variables are captured in real-time in ADC inputs of a compact development system, where these signals are synchronized by the recurrent high order neural network in discrete-time. The proposed work allows synchronization of interactions associated between the neural convergence and the chaotical plant state. The obtained real-time results, and the statistical analyses on the synchronization process validate the possible application in chaos-based communications systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This article studies the impact of cannibalization between new and remanufactured products on supply chain network design and operations by considering a joint pricing-location-inventory problem. A three-level supply chain network that consists of multi-distribution centers and retailers is considered. New and remanufactured products are supplied simultaneously. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer program and is then transformed into a conic quadratic mixed-integer program. An outer approximation-based solution approach is developed to solve the program.

J	Shen, BH; Khishe, M; Mirjalili, S				Shen, Baohua; Khishe, Mohammad; Mirjalili, Seyedali			Evolving Marine Predators Algorithm by dynamic foraging strategy for real-world engineering optimization problems	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE												The Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) is a novel hunting-based optimizer. The MPA's central concept is based on the well-known Levy Flight (LF) and Brownian Motion (BM) strategies as well as a simple transition model between these two strategies. The canonical MPA proposes three static steps to tune the transition behavior between the LF and BM strategies. Although MPA provides exemplary performance in many test functions, the discrete transition between the two mentioned phases causes it to get stuck in local optima when faced with real-world optimization problems. In order to address this shortcoming, this paper proposes a soft dynamic transition between LF and BM to model this encounter naturally, considering the continuous nature of the transition between LF and BM in marine predators' real life. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed Dynamic Foraging Strategy MPA (DFSMPA), twenty-nine optimization test functions, thirty complex CEC-BC-2017 functions, ten benchmarks of CEC06-2019 test suit, and ten real applicable engineering problems, including power system design, synthesis and process design, industrial chemical producer, power -electronic design, mechanical design, and animal feed ratio, are employed. The DFSMPA is evaluated against four groups of standard optimization approaches, including (1) Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), Niching Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA), Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (HGSO) as recent optimization algorithms, (2) Levy Flight GWO (LGWO) and Evolutionary Algorithms with Adaptive Levy Mutations (EALM) as the two best dynamic Levy-based optimization algorithms, (3) SHADE, CMA-ES, and LSHADESPACMA as the three state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, and jDE100, DISHchain1e+12, CIPDE, and EBOwithCMAR as best performing algorithms in IEEE CEC06-2019 competition. Three non-parametric statistical tests, including the Wilcoxon rank-sum, Bonferroni- Dunn and Holm, and Friedman average rank tests, are utilized to perform a comprehensive assessment. The results show that the DFSMPA achieved the first rank among 46 out of 70 benchmark functions and engineering problems and exhibited similar results compared with SHADE and CMA-ES in other benchmarks. The statistical analysis demonstrated that DFSMPA is a significantly superior optimizer than the three first categories' benchmark algorithms, while its result is statistically similar to jDE100, DISHchain1e+12.

Multi-period transportation network investment decision making and policy implications using econometric framework	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS												Transportation infrastructure projects take numerous years of planning before they are scheduled for construction. Prioritization of such projects over a multi-period planning horizon (under a limited budget) is a difficult task, as it is usually formulated as a bilevel network design problem (NDP). Although multi-period network investment is studied in the literature, its application by public agencies is limited because of the complexities involved in network design problems and the computational time needed to analyze large scale networks (i.e., performing the traffic assignment at the lower level of the NDP). The contribution of this research is two-fold. First, it extends a previously published single year discrete network design formulation to a multi-period discrete network design problem (MPNDP) to capture both the spatial and temporal patterns of multiperiod network investment decisions. Second, using the MPNDP investment results; and the network characteristics, this research develops and evaluates a new econometric model the Multi-Period Econometric Network Investment Model (MENIM). MENIM can be used by agencies in place of MPNDP to approximate network investments. The proposed model is calibrated and validated using medium to large scale networks and results show that it provides comparable results to MPNDP within acceptable computational times. Patterns of multiperiod network investments from these numerical experiments are also extensively discussed along with policy recommendations for public agencies.

J	Jassim, WA; Harte, N				Jassim, Wissam A.; Harte, Naomi			Comparison of discrete transforms for deep-neural-networks-based speech enhancement	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING												In recent studies of speech enhancement, a deep-learning model is trained to predict clean speech spectra from the known noisy spectra of speech. Rather than using the traditional discrete Fourier transform (DFT), this paper considers other well-known transforms to generate the speech spectra for deep-learning-based speech enhancement. In addition to the DFT, seven different transforms were tested: discrete Cosine transform, discrete Sine transform, discrete Haar transform, discrete Hadamard transform, discrete Tchebichef transform, discrete Krawtchouk transform, and discrete Tchebichef-Krawtchouk transform. Two deep-learning architectures were tested: convolutional neural networks (CNN) and fully connected neural networks. Experiments were performed for the NOIZEUS database, and various speech quality and intelligibility measures were adopted for performance evaluation. The quality and intelligibility scores of the enhanced speech demonstrate that discrete Sine transformation is better suited for the front-end processing with a CNN as it outperformed the DFT in this kind of application. The achieved results demonstrate that combining two or more existing transforms could improve the performance in specific conditions. The tested models suggest that we should not assume that the DFT is optimal in front-end processing with deep neural networks (DNNs). On this basis, other discrete transformations should be taken into account when designing robust DNN-based speech processing applications.

A discrete coupled memristor neural network model is constructed based on this memristor design. The periodic and chaotic regions of the discrete neural network model are determined using bifurcation and Lyapunov exponent spectrum. Furthermore, by varying the initial values of the discrete memristive neural network, we observe the coexistence of chaos and periodic attractors, as well as periodic attractors. Additionally, an application to color image encryption based on the discrete system model is given. Security analysis is conducted in the aspects of key space, histogram analysis, correlation analysis, sensitivity analysis, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and information entropy analysis. The analysis results show that the algorithm has a key space size of 2(258), and the information entropy of baboon graph is 7.9993, which is very close to the ideal value of 8. It shows that the image encryption algorithm is feasible and effective. Finally, the implementation of the discrete memristive neural network model is realized using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

Based on this model, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the networked singular system regular, impulse-free and stable with an H-infinity norm bound. The corresponding state feedback controller is designed. A practical example is given to show that the proposed event-triggered scheme is more effective and useful than some existing works.

The communication channel is modeled by a MIMO transceiver, which consists of a transmitter, a receiver and an AWGN MIMO channel. We assume that the MIMO transceiver is subject to individual power constraints in transmitted signals. The aim is to find a fundamental limitation on the information constraints so as to stabilize the networked control system over MIMO communication. A necessary and sufficient condition on the pre-determined admissible power levels for networked stabilizability is obtained. We also show that the joint coding/control co-design stabilization problem can be solved via optimal control design and optimal communication design separately.					zhou, you/KBC-3567-2024; Wang, Fei/KEH-6292-2024														0743-1546		978-1-7281-1398-2				2019							4161	4165																WOS:000560779003127

First, by taking network-induced delays and packet dropouts into account, the resulting closed-loop fuzzy system is modeled as an asynchronous discrete-time T-S fuzzy system subject to both interval-like delays and sector nonlinearity. Second, an augmented fuzzy basis-dependent Lyapunov functional is introduced. By employing a matrix-based quadratic convex method, an interval-delay-dependent bounded real lemma is derived such that the closed-loop system has a prescribed H-infinity performance level. Third, a fuzzy controller design method is presented by using a cone complementarity linearization algorithm. Finally, a nonlinear inverted pendulum system via networked fuzzy control is provided to show that the proposed results are of less conservatism and exhibit satisfactory adaptability to sensor saturation.

J	Naumann, R; Dietzel, S; Scheuermann, B				Naumann, Roman; Dietzel, Stefan; Scheuermann, Bjoern			Push the Barrier: Discrete Event Protocol Emulation	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING												The protocol evaluation is an integral part of network protocol design. From the perspective of experimental design, discrete event simulations constitute a middle ground between analytical protocol evaluation and testbeds. They allow precise control of otherwise external influences while supporting more detailed protocol models than analytical evaluations. Compared to testbeds, a major restriction is that existing protocols require a separate implementation in the discrete event model. Creating this implementation model may cause differences between the protocol's simulator-based model and the native implementation, invalidating simulation results. We propose a novel architecture to evaluate unmodified, binary protocol implementations in the state-of-the-art discrete event simulators by utilizing the operating system's system call barrier. Notably, our approach does not affect discrete simulation properties, such as repeatability, and it does not require the native protocol implementation's source code. The evaluation results using existing network protocols show the feasibility of our approach in combination with the ns-3 simulator core. We show that our approach more closely resembles realistic protocol performance when compared to simulator-based protocol models. Moreover, our approach performs better than existing solutions for more realistic protocol simulations.

Firstly, Lyapunov-based full-state adaptive NN control is presented via backstepping, which avoids the possible controller singularity problem in adaptive nonlinear control and solves the noncausal problem in the discrete-time backstepping design procedure. After the strict-feedback form is transformed into a cascade form, another relatively simple Lyapunov-based direct output feedback control is developed.

An Investigation of the Pressure Pulsing Reagent Delivery Approach	GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION												Pressure pulsing technology is an innovative method that has been developed with the aim of overcoming preferred flow paths associated with remediation techniques that rely on the injection of reagents. Numerical and field experiments were conducted to assess how pressure pulsing affects groundwater flow and solute transport during reagent injection. A series of field experiments were performed at two field sites where a monitoring network designed to capture the breakthrough of solutes delivered from an injection well was installed. Pressure pulsing and conventional injection methods were used at each site. One site was comprised of fine sand with low heterogeneity, while the other was moderately heterogeneous with discrete layers varying from fine sand to silt. The data suggest that breakthrough was more uniform for the pressure pulsing injections; however, this difference was minor and complicated by sorption of some of the tracers employed. The groundwater flow and solute transport modeling exercise simulated the rapid boundary pressure modulation that occurs in association with pressure pulsing. Two-dimensional (2D) simulations revealed that repeated sudden onset of injection cessation produces brief periods of gradient reversal and the development of a mixing zone near the injection well. The spatial extents of this mixing zone were found to be highly dependent upon the hydraulic diffusivity of the medium, with medium heterogeneity and pulsing frequency playing secondary roles. Three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations were used to benchmark the observations from one of the field sites. The results from the modeling effort showed that solute breakthrough from a pressure pulsing injection is more dispersed relative to a conventional injection as a result of the mixing zone phenomenon; however, we were unable to directly observe this mixing zone using the instrumentation deployed at the two field sites.

To reduce transmission frequency, a novel aperiodic intermittent event-triggered mechanism (ETM) with discontinuous characteristics is proposed. Under this mechanism, the controller only works within predetermined working intervals, and whether the control signal is updated depends on a preset triggering condition. In addition, an exponential term is designed in this mechanism to achieve integration and correlation between the intermittent mechanism and the ETM, which depends on the initial instants of the working intervals. Compared with the existing ETMs, this mechanism saves communication and computing resources effectively. To improve flexibility in the design of working/rest intervals, the concepts of average working time ratio (AWTR) and average working period (AWP) are introduced to describe intermittent aperiodic performance. A sufficient criterion for the synchronization of discrete-time CDNs is obtained, and the feasible domain of AWTR is calculated. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.						liang, zhi hong/0009-0004-7778-8438; Xie, Xiangpeng/0000-0003-4822-3134													0957-4174	1873-6793				MAR 1	2024	237		B						121500	10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121500	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121500		SEP 2023											WOS:001081800300001

Inspired by classical control theory, we provide a two degrees of freedom control structure for production networks. Besides a trajectory planning unit generating reference signals, it contains a tracking controller. We provide an agent-based modeling procedure using Petri nets in order to incorporate the discrete event nature of production networks into the trajectory planning unit. As they exhibit memory character, some of the Petri net places can be associated with states in the sense of control theory. Based on them we derive a meaningful state space model from the Petri net description. It is used to design the tracking controller which compensates disturbances proximate to the reference trajectory. Since the latter takes account for discrete events, the controller can be designed using classical control theory. In this way, we integrate planning and control of production networks using a combination of discrete event systems and time driven systems in one control structure avoiding the complexity of hybrid system formulations.																					978-1-5386-7544-1				2018							167	172																WOS:000459815100029

Network-Based Approximate Linear Programming for Discrete Optimization	OPERATIONS RESEARCH												We present relaxations for discrete optimization problems using approximate linear programs (ALPs) defined on multiple networks that represent different state-space aggregations. Our network ALP leverages information across these networks using a piecewise-constant value function approximation, and its optimistic bound is theoretically guaranteed to weakly improve upon the bounds from the individual networks used in its construction. Solving network ALPs is challenging because of its large number of constraints-a well-known issue when employing approximate linear programming. We sidestep this issue by using a clique-based graph representation to design a network ALP restriction that admits a polynomial-time solvable extended formulation, which we show to also deliver a weakly better bound than individual networks. We execute a computational study on a challenging bilinear problem arising in marketing analytics and a routing application encountered in the preemptive maintenance of energy or city-owned assets. When used within a branch-and-bound scheme, the network ALP restriction significantly outperforms in both solution quality and time the following benchmarks: a state-of-the-art mathematical programming solver, a generic aggregation/disaggregation scheme applied to a single network, and a heuristic that chooses the best bound among individual networks.

A feedback controller based on sliding mode control is firstly imported in the synchronization of DRNNs. The activation functional in our paper can be more relaxed than the other papers which should satisfy the Lipschitz conditions. For the sake of reducing the computational complexity and conservatism, we consider two quantized methods with uniform and logarithmic quantizer. We gain some specific conditions to ensure the synchronization of discrete-time system. Several examples are presented to support our theorem in the ending. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

But at high frequencies, inductor-free designs are preferred since inductors are heavy and have limited values. An additional reason for not using the inductors (at high frequencies) consists in that the values of very small inductors could be quite imprecise. If LC ladder network is high-pass type, then parallel inductors must be removed. The resulting network will have only series capacitors, which can be combined as a single series capacitor. But if commensurate transmission lines separate the series capacitors, a high-pass mixed element network is obtained. In this paper, a procedure is proposed to compute the values of series capacitors and characteristic impedances of the transmission lines in the mixed element ladder network. The usage of the procedure is explained by means of the given example.																			0098-9886	1097-007X				OCT	2021	49	10					3368	3377		10.1002/cta.3076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cta.3076		MAY 2021											WOS:000656090500001

The decoupled method simplifies the design complexity to achieve asymptotic stability for the uncertain nonlinear system with external disturbance.

In addition, the frictional force analysis for the nonlinear inverted double pendulum system is considered to investigate the relationship between controller and frictional force.

The investigation takes into account both system and sensor nonlinearities under unknown but bounded (UBB) perturbations. Moreover, a novel non-uniform event-triggering condition is introduced to achieve resource conservation while maintaining filter accuracy. The proposed triggering condition is more general and can be customized as per design requirements. Furthermore, a recursive condition for set-membership filter design is derived that guarantees the existence of optimal bounding ellipsoids for true system states. In contrast to the existing methods, the proposed approach considers set-membership filtering for discrete-time systems subject to OSL system and sensor nonlinearities over a WSN and deals with non-uniform amplitude-based triggering. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate filter's efficacy.

H.; Zhang, Yixin; Ding, Hao			Designing an Optimized Water Quality Monitoring Network with Reserved Monitoring Locations	WATER												The optimized design of water quality monitoring networks can not only minimize the pollution detection time and maximize the detection probability for river systems but also reduce redundant monitoring locations. In addition, it can save investments and costs for building and operating monitoring systems as well as satisfy management requirements. This paper aims to use the beneficial features of multi-objective discrete particle swarm optimization (MODPSO) to optimize the design of water quality monitoring networks. Four optimization objectives: minimum pollution detection time, maximum pollution detection probability, maximum centrality of monitoring locations and reservation of particular monitoring locations, are proposed. To guide the convergence process and keep reserved monitoring locations in the Pareto frontier, we use a binary matrix to denote reserved monitoring locations and develop a new particle initialization procedure as well as discrete functions for updating particle's velocity and position. The storm water management model (SWMM) is used to model a hypothetical river network which was studied in the literature for comparative analysis of our work. We define three pollution detection thresholds and simulate pollution events respectively to obtain all the pollution detection time for all the potential monitoring locations when a pollution event occurs randomly at any potential monitoring locations. Compared to the results of an enumeration search method, we confirm that our algorithm could obtain the Pareto frontier of optimized monitoring network design, and the reserved monitoring locations are included to satisfy the management requirements. This paper makes fundamental advancements of MODPSO and enables it to optimize the design of water quality monitoring networks with reserved monitoring locations.

First, the structure of the solution to the Riccati equation associated with a single-input controllable system is analyzed. The solution matrix entries are represented using unknown closed-loop pole variables that are solved via a system of scalar quadratic equations. Then, the gain margin is studied for the modified Riccati equation for both multi-input and single-input systems. A disc gain margin in the complex plane is obtained using the solution matrix. Finally, the feasibility of the Riccati design for the discrete-time network synchronization with general directed graphs is solved via the Lyapunov analysis approach and the gain margin approach, respectively. In the design, a network Lyapunov function is constructed using the Kronecker product of two positive definite matrices: one is the graph positive definite matrix solved from a graph Lyapunov matrix inequality involving the graph Laplacian matrix; the other is the dynamical positive definite matrix solved from the modified Riccati equation. The synchronizing conditions are obtained for the two Riccati design approaches, respectively.					ZHANG, Liangyin/J-7716-2016	ZHANG, Liangyin/0000-0002-2134-8917; CHEN, Michael Z.

Considering the IRS network overhead, the achievable rate model is newly designed to evaluate the practical IRS system performance. Finding the optimal resolution of the IRS discrete phase shifts and a corresponding phase shift vector is an NP-hard combinatorial problem with an extremely large search complexity. Recognizing the performance trade-off between the IRS passive beamforming gain and IRS signaling overheads, the incremental search method is proposed to present the optimal resolution of the IRS discrete phase shift. Moreover, two low-complexity sub-algorithms are suggested to obtain the IRS discrete phase shift vector during the incremental search algorithms. The proposed incremental search-based discrete phase shift method can efficiently obtain the optimal resolution of the IRS discrete phase shift that maximizes the overhead-aware achievable rate. Simulation results show that the discrete phase shift with the incremental search method outperforms the conventional analog phase shift by choosing the optimal resolution of the IRS discrete phase shift. Furthermore, the cumulative distribution function comparison shows the superiority of the proposed method over the entire coverage area. Specifically, it is shown that more than 20% of coverage extension can be accomplished by deploying IRS with the proposed method.

Although it has been suggested that the mechanical and swelling properties of such networks depend on the absence of defects, the structural details of homogeneous networks created by this method have not yet been studied at the molecular level. Here, we report the synthesis of discrete tetrahedral star macromolecules (dTSMs) composed of polylactide (PLA) arms with discrete molecular weight and sequence. Polymer networks prepared by 4 x 4 cross-linking by Cu-free strain-promoted cyclooctyne-azide click chemistry (SPAAC) reaction exhibited a high degree of swelling (>40 fold by weight) in solvents without sacrificing mechanical robustness (elastic modulus >4 kPa). The structural details of the networks were investigated by network disassembly spectrometry (NDS) using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. By implementing a cleavable repeating unit in the discrete PLA arms of dTSM in a sequence-specific manner, the networks could be disassembled into fragments having discrete molecular weights precisely representing their connectivity in the network. This NDS analysis confirmed that end-to-end click reactions of dTSM networks resulted in the formation of a homogeneous network above the critical concentration (similar to 10 w/v%) of building blocks in the solution.					; Kim, So Youn/L-4441-2014	Kim, Kyoung Taek/0000-0002-4915-7602; Kim, So Youn/0000-0003-0066-8839														2161-1653				JAN 3	2024	13	1					75	81		10.1021/acsmacrolett.3c00619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmacrolett.3c00619								38170942					WOS:001143998600001

While introducing numerous benefits, networked control of dynamic systems brings the challenges of finite rate of information exchange and delay. In order to account for finite sampling, the study is conducted directly in discrete time domain. The main emphasis is placed on the design of sliding hyperplane for the systems involving information transfer delay. It is formally shown that the design of linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal plane for a discrete time-delay system may be reduced to plane selection for a delay-free system represented in delay compensator dynamics. The obtained solution relieves complexity of the optimization problem while maintaining robustness to mismatched disturbances of LQ optimal planes.

Some LMI stability criteria are proposed to design the switching signal and guarantee the global exponential stability for a discrete switched time-delay system. Nonnegative inequalities are introduced to improve the conservativeness of the proposed results. A procedure is provided to guarantee the stability of a switched system and design the switching signal. Finally, some numerical examples are illustrated to show the main results.

J	Minoux, M				Minoux, M			Discrete cost multicommodity network optimization problems and exact solution methods	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH												We first introduce a generic model for discrete cost multicommodity network optimization, together with several variants relevant to telecommunication networks such as: the case where discrete node cost functions (accounting for switching equipment) have to be included in the objective; the case where survivability constraints with respect to single-link and/or single-node failure have to be taken into account. An overview of existing exact solution methods is presented, both for special cases (such as the so-called single-facility and two-facility network loading problems) and for the general case where arbitrary step-increasing link cost-functions are considered. The basic discrete cost multicommodity flow problem (DCMCF) as well as its variant with survivability constraints (DCSMCF) are addressed. Several possible directions for improvement or future investigations are mentioned in the concluding section.																			0254-5330	1572-9338					2001	106						19	46		10.1023/A:1014554606793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014554606793													WOS:000175571000002
J	Lo, SZ; Makrucki, BA; Bilbro, GL; Elmaghraby, SE				Lo, SZ; Makrucki, BA; Bilbro, GL; Elmaghraby, SE			Call admission control schemes and ATM network topological design	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												Call admission control criteria are not only important for call admission control itself, but also can be an important input to network topological design. In this paper, we show the difference in terms of network cost incurred by adopting different call admission control schemes in network topological design. We compare two call admission control schemes. Scheme 1 uses equivalent bandwidth as its call admission control criterion and Scheme 2 is based on modeling the volatility of call traffic using Reflected Brownian Motion. Though Scheme 2 increases the complexity of network topological design, it can give lower network costs. Our experimental results show that for the same traffic mix, the network cost can be as little as 10% and as much as 35% lower when Scheme 2 is used instead of Scheme 1. The differences between the pair of resulting networks suggests that network topological design can be used as one of the criteria for choosing the call admission control scheme.

Unlike the standard LQR control problem, a unique feature of the proposed optimal control problem is that the closed-loop generalized discrete-time semistable Lyapunov equation can admit multiple solutions.

The Preserving Kidney Function in Children With CKD (PRESERVE) Study: Rationale, Design, and Methods	KIDNEY MEDICINE												Rationale & objective: PRESERVE seeks to provide new knowledge to inform shared decision-making regarding blood pressure (BP) management for pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD). PRESERVE will compare the effectiveness of alternative strategies for monitoring and treating hypertension on preserving kidney function; expand the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) common data model by adding pediatric- and kidney-specific variables and linking electronic health record data to other kidney disease databases; and assess the lived experiences of patients related to BP management.Study design: Multicenter retrospective cohort study (clinical outcomes) and cross-sectional study (patient-reported outcomes [PROs]).Setting & participants: PRESERVE will include approximately 20,000 children between January 2009-December 2022 with mild-moderate CKD from 15 health care institutions that participate in 6 PCORnet Clinical Research Networks (PEDSnet, STAR, GPC, PaTH, CAPRiCORN, and OneFlorida+). The inclusion criteria were >= 1 nephrologist visit and >= 2 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values in the range of 30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) separated by >= 90 days without an intervening value >= 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and no prior dialysis or kidney transplant.Exposures: BP measurements (clinic-based and 24-hour ambulatory BP); urine protein; and antihypertensive treatment by therapeutic class.Outcomes: The primary outcome is a composite event of a 50% reduction in eGFR, eGFR of <15 mL/min/1.73 m(2), long-term dialysis or kidney transplant. Secondary outcomes include change in eGFR, adverse events, and PROs.Analytical approach: Longitudinal models for dichotomous (proportional hazards or accelerated failure time) and continuous (generalized linear mixed models) clinical outcomes; multivariable linear regression for PROs. We will evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effect by CKD etiology and degree of proteinuria and will examine variation in hypertension management and outcomes based on socio-demographics.Limitations: Causal inference limited by observational analyses.Conclusions: PRESERVE will leverage the PCORnet infrastructure to conduct large-scale observational studies that address BP management knowledge gaps for pediatric CKD, focusing on outcomes that are meaningful to patients.

The randomly occurring quantisation phenomenon is taken into account, which is governed by a Bernoulli distributed stochastic sequence. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a state estimator such that the dynamics of the estimation error is exponentially stable in the mean square. By using the Lyapunov stability theory combined with the stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are first established to ensure the existence of the desired estimator. Then, the explicit expression of the desired estimator gain is described by using the semi-definite programme method. Finally, a numerical example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed estimator design approach.					bo, yu/AAB-3064-2019; Wang, Zidong/H-1523-2011	Wang, Zidong/0000-0002-9576-7401													2161-2927						2014							5403	5408																WOS:000366482805093

First, a discrete event-triggered transmission scheme is proposed to mitigate the utility of limited network bandwidth. Second, with the aid of a reformulated Lipschitz property, the nonlinear error dynamics are converted into a linear parameter varying (LPV) networked system model. Third, based on this model, the finite-frequency H- index is used to measure the worst-case fault sensitivity performance and the L(infinity )norm from unknown disturbance to residual is used to measure disturbance robustness performance. Next, a residual evaluation and a dynamic threshold are synthesised based on the L-infinity norm. Furthermore, sufficient conditions of the FDO design are derived and transformed by a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The proposed FDO design method can significantly reduce the data transmission to relieve the communication pressure, and can also achieve better FD performance than the full frequency domain. Finally, A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design approach.

J	Bartoszewicz, A; Lesniewski, P				Bartoszewicz, Andrzej; Lesniewski, Piotr			Discrete Time Sliding Mode Flow Controllers for Connection-Oriented Networks with Lossy Links	CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES												In this paper we propose two discrete-time sliding mode flow controllers for multisource connection-oriented networks. Each connection in the considered networks is characterized by a time delay and a packet loss ratio. The proposed controllers take advantage of appropriately designed sliding hyperplanes, which ensure the closed-loop system stability and finite-time error convergence to zero. Moreover, the proposed controllers ensure full utilization of the bottleneck link available bandwidth, guarantee bounded transmission rates, and eliminate the risk of buffer overflow in the bottleneck node. Since the primary controller may lead to excessive values of the transmission rate at the beginning of the control process, the modified controller is designed using the concept of the reaching law, which helps the removing of the undesirable effect.

J	Castro, PM; Liao, Q; Liang, YT				Castro, Pedro M.; Liao, Qi; Liang, Yongtu			Comparison of mixed-integer relaxations with linear and logarithmic partitioning schemes for quadratically constrained problems	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING												Piecewise relaxations are powerful techniques to compute strong dual bounds for (mixed-integer) quadratically constrained problems and provide starting points that can be used by local nonlinear solvers to generate high-quality primal solutions. They work by first partitioning the domain of one of the variables in every quadratic or bilinear term and then selecting the optimal interval in the partition through binary variables. A variety of formulations have been proposed that can be distinguished based on how the number of binary variables scales with the number of intervals. In this paper, we compare linear and logarithmic partitioning schemes that can be derived from the piecewise McCormick relaxation (PCM) or the multiparametric disaggregation technique (MDT). Specifically, we propose MDT for a generic numeric representation system, showing that it becomes a linear partitioning scheme when considering a single digit and varying the basis, and a logarithmic partitioning scheme when fixing the basis and varying the number of digits. Through the solution of 25 benchmark instances for the pooling problem, considering relaxations for the p-, q- and tp-formulations, we show that it is better to rely on the linear scheme from PCM for a small number of intervals and on the logarithmic scheme from base-2 MDT when the number is large. The results also show that significantly stronger dual bounds can be obtained compared to commercial global optimization solvers BARON and GloMIQO.

The artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) was mounted below the microstrip antenna array to replace the conducting ground plane of antenna array, which can widen the operational band width and promote the gain of antenna array. A mixed feeding network that consists of laminated waveguide and microstrip line using LTCC technology is designed. With the mixed feeding network, the low profile structure is achieved, which is benefit for the manufacture of conformal structure. The conformal 8 X 8 antenna array is designed with an enhanced bandwidth of 17.4% and a gain up to 23.3dBi by AMC and the phase compensation of the array. The proposed array antenna also features the merits of compact size, stable performance, and high efficiency.																									2013							257	260																WOS:000331839200068

Rail buckling typically occurs at locations with poor lateral track stiffness during periods of warmer weather where the thermal expansion of continuously welded rail (CWR) applies significant compressive stresses, or at locations where braking can apply significant compressive stresses. Rail buckling poses a significant derailment risk, as buckled track generally results in high lateral forces that can lead to flange climbing and derailment. This paper looks for step changes in the curvature as seen by the bogie, using sensors fitted to Instrumented Revenue Vehicles designed and successfully installed by Institute of Railway Technology at Monash University. Instrumented revenue vehicles ORVs) are continuous monitoring systems that measure wagon responses and use this to infer information about the underlying track condition. As the changes in the curvature observed generally occur over short time scales, it is the continuous nature of the IRV recordings that are vital in this instance. This study involved sub-dividing the rail network into many small track sections (bins) and assessing the time-history of measurements at discrete locations. A buckle warning will be given if one or more bins exhibits a significant step-change in IRV measured curvature versus date. This study considers a number of algorithms to identify the step-changes in curvature where both step-change magnitude and significance level are derived to form a multi-dimensional convex space. Advanced statistical modelling has been used to filter and prioritize locations determined to have the highest buckling risk using convex polygons. Using this method, false positive warnings can be reduced to a minimum level, optimizing the system for railway network operators. This study also discusses some of the limitations that events such as flange strikes can introduce and suggests procedures where this approach can be used to provide early warning for incipient rail buckle detection.																					978-0-7844-8125-7				2018							1033	1046																WOS:000432425900103
J	Sen, P; Vial, HJ; Radulescu, O				Sen, Partho; Vial, Henri J.; Radulescu, Ovidiu			Kinetic modelling of phospholipid synthesis in <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> unravels crucial steps and relative importance of multiple pathways	BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY												Background: Plasmodium is the causal parasite of malaria, infectious disease responsible for the death of up to one million people each year. Glycerophospholipid and consequently membrane biosynthesis are essential for the survival of the parasite and are targeted by a new class of antimalarial drugs developed in our lab. In order to understand the highly redundant phospholipid synthethic pathways and eventual mechanism of resistance to various drugs, an organism specific kinetic model of these metabolic pathways need to be developed in Plasmodium species. Results: Fluxomic data were used to build a quantitative kinetic model of glycerophospholipid pathways in Plasmodium knowlesi. In vitro incorporation dynamics of phospholipids unravels multiple synthetic pathways. A detailed metabolic network with values of the kinetic parameters (maximum rates and Michaelis constants) has been built. In order to obtain a global search in the parameter space, we have designed a hybrid, discrete and continuous, optimization method. Discrete parameters were used to sample the cone of admissible fluxes, whereas the continuous Michaelis and maximum rates constants were obtained by local minimization of an objective function. The model was used to predict the distribution of fluxes within the network of various metabolic precursors. The quantitative analysis was used to understand eventual links between different pathways. The major source of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the CDP-choline Kennedy pathway. In silico knock-out experiments showed comparable importance of phosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PMT) and phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT) for PC synthesis. The flux values indicate that, major part of serine derived phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is formed via serine decarboxylation, whereas major part of phosphatidylserine (PS) is formed by base-exchange reactions. Sensitivity analysis of CDP-choline pathway shows that the carrier-mediated choline entry into the parasite and the phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase reaction have the largest sensitivity coefficients in this pathway, but does not distinguish a reaction as an unique rate-limiting step. Conclusion: We provide a fully parametrized kinetic model for the multiple phospholipid synthetic pathways in P. knowlesi. This model has been used to clarify the relative importance of the various reactions in these metabolic pathways. Future work extensions of this modelling strategy will serve to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms governing the development of Plasmodium during its blood stages, as well as the mechanisms of action of drugs on membrane biosynthetic pathways and eventual mechanisms of resistance.

In particular, the impact of evolving agreements in such networks on continuous monitoring is not considered. Also, monitoring is limited to process execution progress and simple process data. In this paper, we extend the possible monitoring options by linking monitoring requirements to generic clauses in agreements established across a network and focus on the problem of preserving the continuous monitorability of these clauses when the agreements evolve, i.e. they are introduced, dropped, or updated. We discuss mechanisms to preserve continuous monitorability in a business network for different types of agreement evolution.and we design a conceptual and technical architecture for a continuous monitoring IT infrastructure that implements the requirements derived from such mechanisms.

The difficulty of mastering the huge capacity and configurability of WDM is not only a physical design and manufacturing issue, but it is also due to a design capability limitation brought forth by the enormous design complexity which cannot be mastered without adequate modeling and simulation tools, The engineering of innovative systems of such complexity requires modeling and simulation tools that support such complexity and allow fast modeling of alternatives and direct simulation of the models to validate their correct behavior. We present here the innovative application of Artifex modeling and simulation environment for the design of optical networks and protocols. Artifex is used to design discrete-event systems, with a visual representation of dynamics and very efficient discrete-event simulation and software generation. Artifex is a very stable and user-friendly environment that has been used, for example, in the design and simulation of traditional routers and switching network architectures.																			0277-786X		0-8194-3436-1				1999	3843						136	147		10.1117/12.360390	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.360390													WOS:000083509400014

Nanoporous hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanorods have been prepared through an advanced spray precipitation method and nanofabricated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets by simply mixing solutions. This approach helps to introduce a continuous conductive network in between the nanorods to enhance ion interactions, giving the composite a promising electrochemical response as a negative electrode for the lithium-ion battery (LIB). The nanocomposites delivered an outstanding reversible capacity of 1330 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) for 100 cycles and showed excellent rate retention during cycling at different current densities over long cycle numbers, highlighting the potential of this material with its specially designed nano-architecture as an anode material for high energy LIBs for electric vehicles. Along with the overwhelming electrochemical performance of chemically modified graphene-oxide-wrapped hematite porous nanorods (alpha-Fe2O3/rGO), the abundance of the hematite source, and the advanced and environmentally friendly synthesis approach show the potential for large-scale preparation of such electrode materials for real world application.

The performance of the algorithms is investigated with simulations in ring and grid network topologies. Simulation results indicate that the algorithms can effectively reduce the number of O/E/O 3R regenerators, leading to less power consumption on signal regeneration and green network design. Among the algorithms, the maximum segment length wavelength assignment (MSL-WA) approach further reduces regenerator numbers, with the cost of placement readjustments.																			2162-108X		978-0-8194-8961-6				2012									83100G	10.1117/12.904198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.904198													WOS:000392591400238

The knowledge of video popularity is very important for system operation, such as video caching on content distribution network (CDN) servers. The video popularity distribution at a given time is quite well understood. We study how the video popularity changes with time, for different types of videos, and apply the results to design video caching strategies. Our study is based on analyzing the video access levels over time, based on data provided by a large video service provider. Our main finding is, while there are variations, the glory days of a video's popularity typically pass by quickly and the probability of replaying a video by the same user is low. The reason appears to be due to fairly regular number of users and view time per day for each user, and continuous arrival of new videos. All these facts will affect how video popularity changes, hence also affect the optimal video caching strategy. Based on the observation from our measurement study, we propose a mixed replication strategy (of LFU and FIFO) that can handle different kinds of videos. Offline strategy assuming tomorrow's video popularity is known in advance is used as a performance benchmark. Through trace-driven simulation, we show that the caching performance achieved by the mixed strategy is very close to the performance achieved by the offline strategy.

J	Majozi, T				Majozi, T			Wastewater minimisation using central reusable water storage in batch plants	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This paper presents a continuous-time mathematical formulation for freshwater and wastewater minimisation in multipurpose batch plants with and without a central reusable water storage facility. The minimisation of wastewater is achieved through the exploitation of recycle and reuse opportunities. A superstructure that entails all the possible recycle and reuse possibilities is used as the basis for the formulation. Initially, the formulation is based on a predefined schedule characterized by a priori specification of starting or finishing times. The formulation is then extended to embed wastewater minimisation within an established scheduling framework in which starting and finishing times become optimization variables. In both forms the formulation can readily be extended to multiple contaminant media, although this will be the subject of another publication. Fixing the outlet concentration and the contaminant mass load for each water using operation in the absence of central reusable water storage initially renders the formulation a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) which is linearized exactly to yield a convex mixed integer linear program (MILP). On the other hand, allowing the outlet concentration to vary within predefined bounds while fixing both the water requirement and contaminant mass load yields a MINLP formulation for which global optimality cannot be guaranteed in complex problems. The developed formulation is applied to a published literature example as well as case studies involving production scheduling. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since the proposed reaching law does not require switching of the sliding variable between positive and negative values in each successive control step, it leads to chattering free operation, does not cause overshoots and helps achieve 100% exploitation of the bottleneck link available bandwidth. Furthermore, the proposed controller always generates bounded data transmission rates. The rates are limited by design parameters and they do not depend on the network initial conditions. The properties of the proposed controller are stated as three theorems, formally proved and verified in a simulation example.

J	Hu, P; Pan, JS; Chu, SC				Hu, Pei; Pan, Jeng-Shyang; Chu, Shu-Chuan			Improved Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer and Its application for feature selection	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS												Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a new swarm intelligence algorithm mimicking the behaviours of grey wolves. Its abilities include fast convergence, simplicity and easy realization. It has been proved its superior performance and widely used to optimize the continuous applications, such as, cluster analysis, engineering problem, training neural network and etc. However, there are still some binary problems to optimize in the real world. Since binary can only be taken from values of 0 or 1, the standard GWO is not suitable for the problems of discretization. Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (BGWO) extends the application of the GWO algorithm and is applied to binary optimization issues. In the position updating equations of BGWO, the a parameter controls the values of A and D, and influences algorithmic exploration and exploitation. This paper analyses the range of values of AD under binary condition and proposes a new updating equation for the a parameter to balance the abilities of global search and local search. Transfer function is an important part of BGWO, which is essential for mapping the continuous value to binary one. This paper includes five transfer functions and focuses on improving their solution quality. Through verifying the benchmark functions, the advanced binary GWO is superior to the original BGWO in the optimality, time consumption and convergence speed. It successfully implements feature selection in the UCI datasets and acquires low classification errors with few features. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most existing methods model human parsing as a general semantic segmentation, which ignores the inherent relationship among hierarchical human parts. In this work, we propose a pose-guided hierarchical semantic decomposition and composition framework for human parsing. Specifically, our method includes a semantic maintained decomposition and composition (SMDC) module and a pose distillation (PC) module. SMDC progressively disassembles the human body to focus on the more concise regions of interest in the decomposition stage and then gradually assembles human parts under the guidance of pose information in the composition stage. Notably, SMDC maintains the atomic semantic labels during both stages to avoid the error propagation issue of the hierarchical structure. To further take advantage of the relationship of human parts, we introduce pose information as explicit guidance for the composition. However, the discrete structure prediction in pose estimation is against the requirement of the continuous region in human parsing. To this end, we design a PC module to broadcast the maximum responses of pose estimation to form the continuous structure in the way of knowledge distillation. The experimental results on the look-into-person (LIP) and PASCAL-Person-Part datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods, that is, 55.21% mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) on LIP and 69.88% mIoU on PASCAL-Person-Part.

However, design of mixed flow pump impeller and its blades seems to be fairly complicated operation even to the person having thorough technical knowledge in the field of turbomachinery. The main aspect of designing an impeller blade for a mixed flow pump impeller is the root section which encounters the maximum stress. Here in this paper mixed flow pump impeller blades are designed having two different blade positioning in the meridional annulus. The stress development in the pump blades are evaluated using FEM analysis. Artificial neural network (ANN) is used to optimize the thickness of the aero foil blade cross-section with respect to Von-misses stress. It is observed that the mixed flow pump impeller blade with inlet inclined blade position in the meridional annulus is more suitable with respect trapezoidal blade as predicted through ANN using RAPID MINER 5.3 software. This is because of the fact that the mean square error for inlet inclined position is much less than that for the trapezoidal blade. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The numerical optimization results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed MILP formulation and superior network performances, validating the proposed framework for optimal virtual topology designs.

Complexity makes it extremely difficult to predict when and where the next service disruption will occur. The authors examine what this means for performance measurement in digital service supply chains. Design/methodology/approach The authors use a mixed-method research design that combines a longitudinal case study of a European digital TV service provider and a system dynamics simulation analysis of that service provider's digital service supply chain. Findings With increased levels of complexity, traditional performance measurement methods, focused on detection of software bugs before release, become fragile or futile. The authors find that monitoring the performance of the service after release, with fast mitigation when service incidents are discovered, appears to be superior. This involves organizational change when traditional methods, like quality assurance, become less important. Research limitations/implications The performance of digital services needs to be monitored by combining automated data collection about the status of the service with data interpretation using human expertise. Investing in human expertise is equally important as investing in automated processes. Originality/value The authors draw on unique empirical data collected from a digital service provider's struggle with performance measurement of its service over a period of nine years. The authors use simulations to show the impact of complexity on staff allocation.					; van Oorschot, Kim E./B-4388-2018	Akkermans, Henk/0000-0001-6365-1052; Wang, Yan/0000-0002-6317-7546; van Oorschot, Kim E./0000-0001-9814-2522													0144-3577	1758-6593				MAR 6	2023	43	3					520	542		10.1108/IJOPM-03-2021-0211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOPM-03-2021-0211		FEB 2022											WOS:000751350200001

This discretized design space allows us to explore the limitless structural complexity of metamaterials in a controlled manner. However, analytical and conventional numerical approaches have difficulty in efficiently navigating this large design space, which grows exponentially with system size. Here we employ machine learning techniques to explore combinatorial metamaterial designs. We show that a trained convolutional neural network is able to classify never before seen configurations into those supporting system-wide periodic deformations in one dimension, line modes, and those who do not with over 99% accuracy. This suggests that the network has correctly learned to identify the set of design rules for the presence of a line mode.

Firstly, by taking the different power-sharing rates of governors into full consideration, a unified model is constructed for interconnected power systems containing multiple governors. Secondly, unlike existing LFC schemes, a non-fragile discrete PID control scheme is designed, which has the performance of tolerating control gain fluctuation and relieving the huge computational burden. Further, by constructing a discrete-type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, improved stability criteria with a strict dissipative performance index are established. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

The main salient feature of the resulting LDI digital allpass networks is that they are minimal in the number of required digital multiplications, while being canonical in the number of required digital unit-delay operations.

Matrix decomposition based feature extraction for murmur classification	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS												Heart murmurs often indicate heart valvular disorders. However, not all heart murmurs are organic. For example, musical murmurs detected in children are mostly innocent. Because of the challenges of mastering auscultation skills and reducing healthcare expenses, this study aims to discover new features for distinguishing innocent murmurs from organic murmurs, with the ultimate objective of designing an intelligent diagnostic system that could be used at home. Phonocardiographic signals that were recorded in an auscultation training CD were used for analysis. Instead of the discrete wavelet transform that has been used often in previous work, a continuous wavelet transform was applied on the heart sound data. The matrix that was derived from the continuous wavelet transform was then processed via singular value decomposition and QR decomposition, for feature extraction. Shannon entropy and the Gini index were adopted to generate features. To reduce the number of features that were extracted, the feature selection algorithm of sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) was utilized to select the most significant features, with the selection criterion being the maximization of the average accuracy from a 10-fold cross-validation of a classification algorithm called classification and regression trees (CART). An average sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 83%, and a classification accuracy of 90% were achieved. These favorable results substantiate the effectiveness of the feature extraction methods based on the proposed matrix decomposition method.

However, in urban environments, the communication links between the UAV and IoTDs are prone to be frequently blocked by buildings, which severely impairs the freshness of information collected by the UAV. Thus, how to overcome urban building blockages and ensure fresh data collection is quite important but neglected in existing works. In this paper, for keeping the information fresh, we propose to utilize the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to assist the UAV in mitigating signal propagation impairments caused by building blockages. The formulated optimization problem is minimizing the age of information (AoI) of all IoTDs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, IoTD scheduling and discrete phase shifts of the RIS. It is a mixed-integer non-convex problem as well as lacking the complete channel state information (CSI), thus using conventional optimization methods is intractable. To address this issue, we present an effective and robust deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheme called "SAC-AO-RIS," where a soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm with recent-prioritized experience replay is designed for learning highly stable policies of UAV trajectory and IoTD scheduling, and an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is leveraged for solving RIS phase shifts. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed scheme compared with other baseline approaches.

The performance of the algorithms is investigated with simulations in ring and grid network topologies. Simulation results indicate that the algorithms can effectively reduce the number of O/E/O 3R regenerators, leading to less power consumption on signal regeneration and green network design.

The conventional design process, which requires iterative optimization and performance evaluation, is slow and dependent on initial designs. Past work has used conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to enable direct design synthesis for given target performances. However, most existing cGANs are restricted to categorical conditions. Recent work on Continuous conditional GAN (CcGAN) tries to address this problem, but still faces two challenges: 1) it performs poorly on non-uniform performance distributions, and 2) the generated designs may not cover the entire design space. We propose a new model, named Performance Conditioned Diverse Generative Adversarial Network (PcDGAN), which introduces a singular vicinal loss combined with a Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) based loss function to enhance diversity. PcDGAN uses a new self-reinforcing score called the Lambert Log Exponential Transition Score (LLETS) for improved conditioning. Experiments on synthetic problems and a real-world airfoil design problem demonstrate that PcDGAN outperforms state-of-the-art GAN models and improves the conditioning likelihood by 69% in an airfoil generation task and upto 78% in synthetic conditional generation tasks and achieves greater design space coverage. The proposed method enables efficient design synthesis and design space exploration with applications ranging from CAD model generation to metamaterial selection.																					978-1-4503-8332-5				2021										10.1145/3447548.3467414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3447548.3467414													WOS:000749556803048

The objective function at the tipper level is defined as the total travel time on the network, Plus total investment Costs of link capacity expansions. The lower level problem is formulated as a certain traffic assignment model. It is well known that such bilevel program is nonconvex and algorithms for finding global optimal solutions are preferable to be used in solving it. Simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) are two global methods and can then be used to determine the optimal solution of CNDP. Since the application of SA and GA on continuous network design on real transportation network requires solving traffic assignment model many times at each iteration of the algorithm, computation time needed is tremendous. It is important to compare the efficacy of the two methods and choose the more efficient one as reference method in practice. In this paper, the continuous network design problem has been Studied using SA and GA on a simulated network. The lower level program is formulated as user equilibrium traffic assignment model and Frank-Wolf method is used to solve it. it is found that when demand is large, SA is more efficient than GA in solving CNDP, and much more computational effort is needed for GA to achieve the same optimal solution as SA. However. when demand is light, GA can reach a more optimal solution at the expense of more computation time. It is also found that increasing the iteration number at each temperature in SA does not necessarily improve solution. The finding in this example is different from [Karoonsoontawong, A. & Waller, S.

In the proposed ILC scheme, the FlexRay communication protocol with both static and dynamic segments is introduced in the design. The design has the advantage to reduce the communication channel bandwidth load and hence improve the performance of finite-iteration tracking. This paper provides the first integrating approach to iterative learning design based on the dynamic capability of FlexRay communication channels, and can be generalized to other learning process in network control design.

Compared with the traditional two-phase approach, forecasting equity's trend and then weighting them by combinatorial optimization, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have shown advances in reward chasing with optimal policies. However, existing DRL-based methods either leverage portfolio optimization on low-frequency scenarios or only support a very limited number of assets with discrete action space, facing significant computing efficiency challenges. Therefore, we propose an efficient DRL-based policy optimization (DRPO) method for high-frequency trading. In particular, we model the portfolio management task with Markov Decision Process by directly inferring the equity weights in the action space guided by maximum accumulated returns. To reduce agents' interaction complexity without reducing interpretation, we detach the environment into the "static" market states and "dynamic" portfolio weight states. Then, we design an efficient reward expectation calculation algorithm via probabilistic dynamic programming, which enables our agents directly collect feedback away from trajectory sampling-based morass. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that solves the high-frequency portfolio optimization problem by devising an efficient continuous space policy optimization algorithm in the DRL framework. Through extensive experiments on the real-world data from Dow Jones, Coinbase and SSE exchanges, we show that our proposed DRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods. The results demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, progress can be gained if more Dutch adolescents adhere to the nutritional guidelines. School-based initiatives offer opportunities to deal with the unhealthy eating behaviours of adolescents via nutrition educational interventions. In designing and/or re-designing school-based interventions, it is important to enhance optimal context-oriented implementation adaptation by involving the complex adaptive school system. This paper elaborates on the way of dealing with the dynamic implementation context of the educational programme "Krachtvoer" (ENG: "Power food") for prevocational schools, how the programme can be adapted to each unique implementation context, and how the programme can be progressively kept up to date. Following a co-creation-guided approach with various intersectoral stakeholders within and outside the school setting, action-oriented mixed research methods (i.e., observations, semi-structured interviews, focus group interviews, programme usage monitoring, and questionnaires) constantly provide input to develop the programme and its implementation strategy via continuous micro-process cycles. Successful co-creation of school-based health promotion seems to be dependent on proper intersectoral cooperation between research and practice communities, a national partner network that can provide project-relevant insights and establish capacity building aimed at improving contextual fit, and a time-investment balance in and between sectors.						van Assema, Patricia/0000-0003-4928-6495; bessems, kathelijne/0000-0003-3879-9279; Driessen - Willems, Marion Danielle/0000-0002-3806-9607; Bartelink, Nina/0000-0002-8098-5289														1660-4601				AUG	2021	18	15							7866	10.3390/ijerph18157866	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157866								34360158					WOS:000681997200001

J	Ng, DWK; Lo, ES; Schober, R				Derrick Wing Kwan Ng; Lo, Ernest S.; Schober, Robert			Wireless Information and Power Transfer: Energy Efficiency Optimization in OFDMA Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												This paper considers orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We study the resource allocation algorithm design for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bits/Joule delivered to the receivers). In particular, we focus on power splitting hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting. Two scenarios are investigated considering different power splitting abilities of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can split the received power into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary power splitting ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can split the received power only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed power splitting ratios. For both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm design as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. By exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the non-convex problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and wireless power transfer: (1) wireless power transfer enhances the system energy efficiency by harvesting energy in the radio frequency, especially in the interference limited regime; (2) the presence of multiple receivers is beneficial for the system capacity, but not necessarily for the system energy efficiency.

Developing a hybrid PSO-ANN model for estimating the ultimate bearing capacity of rock-socketed piles	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS												Rock-socketed piles are commonly used in foundations built in soft ground, and thus, their bearing capacity is a key issue of universal concern in research, design and construction. The accurate prediction of the ultimate bearing capacity (Q (u)) of rock-socketed piles is a difficult task due to the uncertainty surrounding the various factors that affect this capacity. This study was aimed at developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model, as well as a hybrid model based on both particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and ANN, with which to predict the Q (u) of rock-socketed piles. PSO, a powerful population-based algorithm used in solving continuous and discrete optimisation problems, was here employed as a robust global search algorithm to determine ANN weights and biases and thereby improve model performance. To achieve the study aims, 132 piles socketed in various rock types as part of the Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit project, Malaysia, were investigated. Based on previous related investigations, parameters with the most influence on Q (u) were identified and utilised in the modelling procedure of the intelligent systems. After constructing and modelling these systems, selected performance indices including the coefficient of determination (R (2)), root-mean-square error, variance account for and total ranking were used to identify the best models and compare the obtained results. This analysis revealed that the hybrid PSO-ANN model offers a higher degree of accuracy compared to conventional ANN for predicting the Q (u) of rock-socketed piles. However, the developed model would be most useful in the preliminary stages of pile design and should be used with caution.

One method to decrease these costs while truding accuracy is weight and/or activation word-length reduction. Thereby, layerwise mixed-precision quanllzation allows for more eftlclent results while inflating the design space. In this work, we present an indepth quantitative methodology to efficiently explore the design space considering the limited hardware resources of a given FPGA. Our holistic exploration approach vertically traverses the various design entry levels from the arehitectural down to the logic level, and laterally covers optimization from processing elements to datallow for an efficient mixed-preclslon CNN aceelerator. Our resulting hardware accelerators implement truly mixed-precision operations that enable efficient execution of layer-wise and channel-wise quantized CNNs. Mapping feed-forward and identity-shortcut-connection mixed-precision CNNs result in competitive accuracy-throughout trade-offs: 245 frames/s with 87.48% Top-S accuracy for ResNet-18 and 92.9% Top-S aceuracy with 1.13 TOpsls for ResNet-152, respectively. Thereby, the required memory footprint for parameters is redueed by 4.9x and 9.4x compared to the respective Boating-point baseline.

At the beginning a review of recent developments in the area of robust estimators and observers for non-linear discrete-time systems is portrayed and a less restrictive procedure for designing a neural network-based H-infinity observer is proposed. The developed approach guaranties a predefined disturbance attenuation level and convergence of the observer, as well as unknown input decoupling, and state and actuator fault estimation. The main advantage of the design procedure is its simplicity. The paper describes an observer design procedure which comes to solving a set of linear matrix inequalities.

The nonlinear complex dynamical network system consists of N discrete-time T-S fuzzy subsystems.

By considering the characteristic of interconnection matrix of the network, the test of the stability of a network is separated in to the test of the stability of the several nonlinear systems. Furthermore, the consensus problem for the leader-follower complex dynamical network is considered.

This study mainly discusses the Internet of Things supervision system and supply chain financial supervision method based on blockchain technology. The whole blockchain network is a decentralized system, which consists of six layers: data layer, network layer, and consensus layer. These three layers are the foundation layer; the other three layers are incentive layer, contract layer, and application layer. The interface of the platform needs to be conceived in combination with the business of building materials. According to the functional differentiation, the required interfaces mainly include information generation interface, information verification, information retrieval, and other information interfaces. Smart contracts can process data, operate asset transactions, manage smart assets, and expand the ability of blockchain to use data. In this way, the blockchain technology can trace the source of the data, so as to ensure the authenticity and security of the data. Blockchain technology can be used in data tracking. Specifically, in the building materials industry, with the help of blockchain technology, building material mixing enterprises can see the raw materials such as sand and gravel purchased under the order, the region where they are produced, the time point of transportation, the carrier, etc. In the process of supply chain financial supervision experiment, when the pledge rate of building materials is within the range of [0.4206,1], the bank income under the block chain mode is higher. The system designed in this study realizes the certification and traceability of building materials and has good use value.																			1530-8669	1530-8677				DEC 24	2021	2021								2411424	10.1155/2021/2411424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/2411424													WOS:000797363200002

The algorithm uses a fine-tuning strategy to attain a robust solution close as possible to an ideal target, while simultaneously guarantees robustness according to a preset trade-off risk. The framework comprises original concepts, a mathematical approach, and an algorithm. Statistical treatment based on the original framework concepts supports short, middle, or long-term decision-making settings. The framework is highly tractable as the algorithm forces the creation of a setting for a robust optimization considering the specified risk. This manuscript provides an in-depth discussion of its philosophy, objective, original concepts, fields of application, as well as statistical and probabilistic fundamentals. The framework can be applied in linear and nonlinear mathematical models if the objective function is monotonic in the domain of the active convex region. In addition, it is needed to follow some axioms stated in the paper. The framework is recommended for discrete and continuous optimization problems, including SDP, LP, NLP, MILP or MINLP. Real-world applications regarding nonlinear models are restrict. Operations research are a great scope of application having a myriad number of linear models. Numerical simulations were done considering a planning of a sales problem, solving several examples to validate the study and to gain a better understanding of the framework. All results have showed high tractability and performance.

As the pivotal base of 3D visualization and modeling, DTM should be characterized by high precision, less storage and well interactivity during graphic operation. Considering the diversity of data source and taking advantage of two data structures, triangulated irregular network(TIN) and non-uniformrational B-splines(NURBS), a novel methodology is presented for reconstructingengineering terrain of hydropower project. With integration of multi-source data, enhanced Delaunay algorithm is introduced to rebuild the TIN DTM, which is a terrain surface in TIN and a faithful depiction of complex topography but in low-memory effeiency. Based on the TIN model, applying section scanning sampling and linear interpolation, the transformation from discrete, irregular and diverse data to continuous and regular sampling cross-sectional curve sequence, is realized. The appropriate compression of the sampling data is also imposed to be performed for guaranteeing the following reconstruction work. Eventually, employing the NURBS technique and skinning method, the NURBS-DTM, which represents a NURBS surface and satisfies the requirement after precision assess with weighted errors, is reconstructed with the intermediate data. Meanwhile, there is another achievement that two databases of terrain data, one from initial data and the other from sampling data, are established for repeatable reconstruction with different demands. With the successful application of the presented method, a stable foundation is laid for 3D engineering geological modeling, visual designing and analysis of the hydropower projects.

This problem is more challenging than the traditional one for electronic communication networks, because it has the wavelength-continuous constraint and it involves routing and wavelength assignment, In this problem, we are given the number of lightpaths required by every node pair and a cost specification, and our objective is to determine a physical topology of minimal cost. We formulate the problem, prove that it is NP-hard, and design an efficient algorithm called two-stage cut saturation algorithm for it. In the first stage, we relax the wavelength-continuous constraint and apply the main idea of the cut saturation method to determine a goad initial network. In the second stage, we impose the wavelength-continuous constraint and perform routing and wavelength assignment to establish the specified lightpaths on the initial network, When some lightpaths cannot be established, we apply the main idea of the cut saturation method to optimize the insertion of additional links into the network. Simulation results show the following: 1) the proposed algorithm can efficiently design networks with low costs and high utilization and 2) if wavelength converters are available to support full wavelength conversion, the total cost of the links can he significantly reduced.

J	Bhavya, R; Elango, L				Bhavya, Ravinder; Elango, Lakshmanan			Ant-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problems in Water Resources Management	WATER												Ant-inspired metaheuristic algorithms known as ant colony optimization (ACO) offer an approach that has the ability to solve complex problems in both discrete and continuous domains. ACOs have gained significant attention in the field of water resources management, since many problems in this domain are non-linear, complex, challenging and also demand reliable solutions. The aim of this study is to critically review the applications of ACO algorithms specifically in the field of hydrology and hydrogeology, which include areas such as reservoir operations, water distribution systems, coastal aquifer management, long-term groundwater monitoring, hydraulic parameter estimation, and urban drainage and storm network design. Research articles, peer-reviewed journal papers and conference papers on ACO were critically analyzed to identify the arguments and research findings to delineate the scope for future research and to identify the drawbacks of ACO. Implementation of ACO variants is also discussed, as hybrid and modified ACO techniques prove to be more efficient over traditional ACO algorithms. These algorithms facilitate formulation of near-optimal solutions, and they also help improve cost efficiency. Although many studies are attempting to overcome the difficulties faced in the application of ACO, some parts of the mathematical analysis remain unsolved. It is also observed that despite its popularity, studies have not been successful in incorporating the uncertainty in ACOs and the problems of dimensionality, convergence and stability are yet to be resolved. Nevertheless, ACO is a potential area for further research as the studies on the applications of these techniques are few.

We assume only a lower bound for the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrices associated with the communication network is known. For the rest the weighted, directed graph is completely arbitrary. Our solvability conditions reveal that the synchronization problem is solvable for any nonzero lower bound if and only if the agents are at most weakly unstable (i.e., agents have all eigenvalues in the closed unit disc). However for a given lower bound, we can achieve synchronization for a class of unstable agents. We provide protocol design for at most weakly unstable agents based on either a direct eigenstructure assignment method or a standard H-2 discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE). We also provide a protocol design for strictly unstable agents based on the standard H-2 DARE.

As currently FOEs are not available as discrete elements, suitable RC networks are used to overcome this obstacle. In this paper we primary propose the transformation of fractional-order elements to cover the whole span of alpha by a reduced number of RC networks or later readily available discrete FOEs. Using this approach, FOEs can be designed featuring complementary fractional order beta, i.e. beta = 1 - alpha. Analysing the transformation possibilities, we also discuss the design of fractional capacitance multiplier.

In this paper, heuristic fuzzy rules were used with the intention of improving the performance of optimization models, introducing experiential rules acquired from experts and utilizing recommendations. The aim of this paper was to define soft constraints using an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This newly-developed soft constraint was applied to discrete optimization for obtaining optimal solutions. Even though the computational model is based on advanced computational technologies including fuzzy logic, neural networks and discrete optimization, it can be used to solve real-world problems of great interest for design engineers. The proposed computational model was used to find the minimum weight solutions for simply-supported laterally-restrained beams.

A novel networked predictive control algorithm based on k-order adaptive discrete-time sliding-mode control (k-ADSMC) is proposed. The ADSMC, which can self-adapting adjust sliding-mode parameters and ensure faster convergence, is designed based on the error and error difference of tracking output. Furthermore, k-ADSMC is designed, which uses the estimated disturbance as weight factors and synthesizes the sliding-mode values of all k times, in order to improve the robust of tracking control. Finally, the stability of the system is proved, and a dc motor servo system is utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.					zhangyong, chen/AAN-1723-2020	chen, yong/0000-0003-4580-8655													0278-0046	1557-9948				MAY	2017	64	5					4037	4047		10.1109/TIE.2017.2652398	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2652398													WOS:000399674000057

Structured sequence processing and combinatorial binding: neurobiologically and computationally informed hypotheses	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Understanding how the brain forms representations of structured information distributed in time is a challenging endeavour for the neuroscientific community, requiring computationally and neurobiologically informed approaches. The neural mechanisms for segmenting continuous streams of sensory input and establishing representations of dependencies remain largely unknown, as do the transformations and computations occurring between the brain regions involved in these aspects of sequence processing. We propose a blueprint for a neurobiologically informed and informing computational model of sequence processing (entitled: Vector-symbolic Sequencing of Binding INstantiating Dependencies, or VS-BIND). This model is designed to support the transformation of serially ordered elements in sensory sequences into structured representations of bound dependencies, readily operates on multiple timescales, and encodes or decodes sequences with respect to chunked items wherever dependencies occur in time. The model integrates established vector symbolic additive and conjunctive binding operators with neurobiologically plausible oscillatory dynamics, and is compatible with modern spiking neural network simulation methods. We show that the model is capable of simulating previous findings from structured sequence processing tasks that engage fronto-temporal regions, specifying mechanistic roles for regions such as prefrontal areas 44/45 and the frontal operculum during interactions with sensory representations in temporal cortex. Finally, we are able to make predictions based on the configuration of the model alone that underscore the importance of serial position information, which requires input from time-sensitive cells, known to reside in the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards mechanistic models of meaning composition'.

THE PRICE OF STABILITY OF WEIGHTED CONGESTION GAMES	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING												We give exponential lower bounds on the Price of Stability (PoS) of weighted congestion games with polynomial cost functions. In particular, for any positive integer d we construct rather simple games with cost functions of degree at most d which have a PoS of at least Omega(Phi(d))(d+1), where Phi(d) similar to d/ In d is the unique positive root of the equation x(d+1) = (x + 1)(d). This almost closes the huge gap between Theta(d) and (1) Phi(d+1)(d). Our bound extends also to network congestion games. We further show that the PoS remains exponential even for singleton games. More generally, we provide a lower bound of Omega((1 + 1/alpha)d/d) on the PoS of alpha-approximate Nash equilibria for singleton games. All our lower bounds hold for mixed and correlated equilibria as well. On the positive side, we give a general upper bound on the PoS of alpha-approximate Nash equilibria, which is sensitive to the range W of the player weights and the approximation parameter alpha. We do this by explicitly constructing a novel approximate potential function, based on Faulhaber's formula, that generalizes Rosenthal's potential in a continuous, analytic way. From the general theorem, we deduce two interesting corollaries. First, we derive the existence of an approximate pure Nash equilibrium with PoS at most (d + 3)/2; the equilibrium's approximation parameter ranges from Theta(1) to d+ 1 in a smooth way with respect to W. Second, we show that for unweighted congestion games, the PoS of alpha-approximate Nash equilibria is at most (d + 1)/alpha.

Each operator contains an internal state variable, and the operator network represents a system of recurrence relations. The temporal values of each state variable form a basis sequence. The least mean squares (LMS) weighted sum of basis sequences compute the output from the network. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to evolve the DDBN. Three different target data sequences were chosen to test the genetic design of the DDBNs. Results indicate that DDBNs with LMS summing output junctions are effective in approximating time based data sequences and capable of storing information in a procedural, dynamical fashion.

J	Nguyen, DT; Kim, H; Lee, HJ				Duy Thanh Nguyen; Kim, Hyun; Lee, Hyuk-Jae			Layer-Specific Optimization for Mixed Data Flow With Mixed Precision in FPGA Design for CNN-Based Object Detectors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY												Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require both intensive computation and frequent memory access, which lead to a low processing speed and large power dissipation. Although the characteristics of the different layers in a CNN are frequently quite different, previous hardware designs have employed common optimization schemes for them. This paper proposes a layer-specific design that employs different organizations that are optimized for the different layers. The proposed design employs two layer-specific optimizations: layer-specific mixed data flow and layer-specific mixed precision. The mixed data flow aims to minimize the off-chip access while demanding a minimal on-chip memory (BRAM) resource of an FPGA device. The mixed precision quantization is to achieve both a lossless accuracy and an aggressive model compression, thereby further reducing the off-chip access. A Bayesian optimization approach is used to select the best sparsity for each layer, achieving the best trade-off between the accuracy and compression. This mixing scheme allows the entire network model to be stored in BRAMs of the FPGA to aggressively reduce the off-chip access, and thereby achieves a significant performance enhancement. The model size is reduced by 22.66-28.93 times compared to that in a full-precision network with a negligible degradation of accuracy on VOC, COCO, and ImageNet datasets. Furthermore, the combination of mixed dataflow and mixed precision significantly outperforms the previous works in terms of both throughput, off-chip access, and on-chip memory requirement.

Faster Converging Global Heuristic for Continuous Network Design Using Radial Basis Functions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												In light of the demand for more complex network models and general solution methods, this research introduces a radial basis function-based method as a faster alternative global heuristic to a genetic algorithm method for the continuous network design problem. Two versions of the algorithm are tested against the genetic algorithm in three experiments: the Sioux Falls, South Dakota, network with standard origin destination flows; the same network with double the flows to test performance under a more congested scenario; and an illustrative experiment with the Anaheim, California, network to compare the scalability of performance. To perform the experiments, parameters for the network design problem were developed for the Anaheim network. The Anaheim test would be the first instance of testing the radial basis function methods on a 31-dimensional network design problem. Results indicate that the multistart local radial basis function method performs notably better than the genetic algorithm in all three experiments and would therefore be an attractive method to apply to more complicated network design models involving larger networks and more complex constraints, objectives, and representations of the time dimension.

This paper proposes a robust optimization model for handling the inherent uncertainty of input data in a closed-loop supply chain network design problem. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for designing a closed-loop supply chain network. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is presented by using the recent extensions in robust optimization theory. Finally, to assess the robustness of the solutions obtained by the novel robust optimization model, they are compared to those generated by the deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model in a number of realizations under different test problems.

In this note, we take a first step towards this goal, by formulating the TCP dynamics as a discrete linear system with nonlinear feedback gain.

It is shown how trigger functions can be designed and parametrized such that an a priori demanded performance bound will not be violated. Furthermore the general approach is used to derive a triggering mechanism with guaranteed characterization of the resulting network traffic.

With strength and shrinkage as key indices, the influence of length of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber, fiber content, particle size of rubber powder, and rubber powder content on the performance of CSM analyzed, and the optimum mixing proportion is determined. Based on this, the modification mechanism of CSM by rubber powder and fiber is further studied from a micro perspective. results show that the 7-day unconfined compressive strength of CSM gradually increases the increase of fiber length. With the increase of fiber content, the compressive strength shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. The 7-day unconfined compressive strength CSM gradually increases with the increase of rubber powder mesh size and linearly decreases with the increase of rubber powder content. The 28-day average dry-shrinkage coefficient CSM shows a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the increase of fiber length fiber content, and gradually increasing with the increase of rubber powder mesh number rubber powder content. Considering the strength and shrinkage characteristics, the optimum mixing parameters are 40 mesh rubber powder, 0.5 % rubber powder, 18-mm fiber length, and 1.2-kg/m3 fiber content. Scanning electron microscopy results show that there is a between the rubber powder and the cement matrix, and the interface between the two is continuous, with weak bonding, resulting in a decrease in the compressive strength of PVA fiber can improve the toughness of CSM.

Quantitative knowledge on the temporal and spatial variations in the heights of the ABL and its sub-layers is still scarce, despite their importance for a series of applications (including, for example, air quality, numerical weather prediction, greenhouse gas assessment, and renewable energy production). Thanks to recent advances in ground-based remote-sensing measurement technology and algorithm development, continuous profiling of the entire ABL vertical extent at high temporal and vertical resolution is increasingly possible. Dense measurement networks of autonomous ground-based remote-sensing instruments, such as microwave radiometers, radar wind profilers, Doppler wind lidars or automatic lidars and ceilometers are hence emerging across Europe and other parts of the world. This review summarises the capabilities and limitations of various instrument types for ABL monitoring and provides an overview on the vast number of retrieval methods developed for the detection of ABL sub-layer heights from different atmospheric quantities (temperature, humidity, wind, turbulence, aerosol). It is outlined how the diurnal evolution of the ABL can be monitored effectively with a combination of methods, pointing out where instrumental or methodological synergy are considered particularly promising. The review highlights the fact that harmonised data acquisition across carefully designed sensor networks as well as tailored data processing are key to obtaining high-quality products that are again essential to capture the spatial and temporal complexity of the lowest part of the atmosphere in which we live and breathe.

We first consider a conventional network energy efficiency maximization (EEmax) problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamformers and antennas selected to be used in transmission. We also account for per-antenna maximum power constraints to avoid nonlinear distortion in power amplifiers and user-specific minimum rate constraints to guarantee certain service levels and fairness. To be energy efficient, transmit antenna selection is employed. It eventually leads to a mixed-Boolean fractional program. We then propose two different approaches to solve this difficult problem. The first solution is based on a novel modeling technique that produces a tight continuous relaxation. The second approach is based on sparsity-inducing method, which does not require the introduction of any Boolean variable. We also investigate the tradeoff between the energy efficiency and sum rate by proposing two different formulations. In the first formulation, we propose a new metric, that is, the ratio of the sum rate and the so-called weighted power. Specifically, this metric reduces to EEmax when the weight is 1, and to sum rate maximization when the weight is 0. In the other method, we treat the tradeoff problem as a multiobjective optimization for which a scalarization approach is adopted. Numerical results illustrate significant achievable energy efficiency gains over the method where the antenna selection is not employed. The effect of antenna selection on the energy efficiency and sum rate tradeoff is also demonstrated.

The state matrices of LPV discrete systems are deterministic functions and changed with parameters; the range of parameters is measurable. Considering the characteristics of networks with random time-varying delay, we proposed a new parameter-dependent H-infinity, performance criterion based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The coupling between Lyapunov functions and system matrices could be eliminated by introducing an additional matrix in this criterion, which made it easier for numerical implementation. On this basis, we designed a state feedback controller by virtue of linear matrix inequalities, which transformed the sufficient conditions into existence condition of solution of parametric linear matrix inequalities. The designed controller could keep the closed-loop system asymptotically stable under given time delay and probability and meet predefined performance metric. The validity of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulation.																			1024-123X	1563-5147					2018	2018								9095014	10.1155/2018/9095014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/9095014													WOS:000449802000001

Global optimum of the linearized network design problem with equilibrium flows	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												The road network design problem, typically formulated as a bi-level program or a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, is generally non-convex. The non-convexity stems from both the traffic assignment equilibrium conditions and the non-linear travel time function. In this study, we formulate the network design problem as a single-level optimization problem with equilibrium constraints, and then we transform the equilibrium constraints into a set of mixed-integer constraints and linearize the travel time function. The final result is that we cast the network design problem with equilibrium flows into a mixed-integer linear program, whose solution possesses the desirable property of global optimality, subject to the resolution of the linearization scheme adopted.

By subdividing the product range into product families, the complexity of decision-making processes is reduced. Subsequently, target conflicts between product families are resolved systematically from an overall corporate view by deriving the smallest possible holistic decision scope.

The measurement output and control input signals are quantized before being transmitted in communication network. The quantization density of the network is assumed to be variable depending on the throughputs of network for the sake of congestion avoidance. The variation of the quantization density modes satisfies persistent dwell-time (PDT) switching which is more general than dwell-time switching in networked channels. By using a quantization-error-dependent Lyapunov function approach, sufficient conditions are given to ensure that the quantized systems are finite-time stable and finite-time bounded with a prescribed H-infinity performance, upon which a set of controllers depending on the mode of quantization density are designed. In order to show the effectiveness of the designed H-infinity controller, we apply the developed theoretical results to a numerical example.

In the de-aggregation processing, the input 30 Gbit/s 8QAM signal is firstly de-aggregated into one 20 Gbit/s QPSK signal and one 10 Gbit/s binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signal by deploying self-phase modulation (SPM), cross-phase modulation (XPM), four-wave mixing (FWM) and parameter amplification (PA) effects. One continuous optical carrier can be extracted from the converted BPSK signal by designing a feed-forward based modulation stripping configuration. The converted OOK signal can be obtained through vector superposition between the extracted optical carrier and the converted BPSK signal. In the aggregation processing, the converted 20 Gbit/s QPSK signal and the 10 Gbit/s OOK signal are fed to another HNLF and aggregated into one 30 Gbit/s 8QAM signal again by utilizing XPM and PA effects. Moreover, the aggregated 8QAM signal keeps the same wavelength and information integrity as the input 8QAM signal. the Error vector magnitude (EVM) and the bit error ratio (BER) for the 8QAM signal before and after aggregation and de-aggregation are measured to evaluate the scheme performance. The proposed all-optical aggregation and de-aggregation scheme for the advanced and simple modulation formats can be applied at the intermediate network node (INN) to solve the network traffic aggregation and de-aggregation with different modulation formats.					yang, Jiali/AAH-3959-2020; Xu, Qi/KSM-0275-2024	yang, Jiali/0000-0001-8070-8751; 													1068-5200	1095-9912				MAY	2023	77								103279	10.1016/j.yofte.2023.103279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yofte.2023.103279		FEB 2023											WOS:000949425700001
J	Wang, F; Shu, SL; Lin, F				Wang, Fei; Shu, Shaolong; Lin, Feng			Robust Networked Control of Discrete Event Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												In this paper, we investigate the robust control problem of discrete event systems in a networked environment. In other words, we use a supervisor to control several possible plants (discrete event systems) to achieve given specifications when there are communication delays and losses in communication networks linking the supervisor and the plants. We translate the robust networked control problem into a conventional networked control problem by constructing an augmented automaton for all possible plants and an augmented specification automaton for the corresponding specification automata. We then solve the robust networked control problem. We consider two cases. The first case is when all the specifications are the same. For this case, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a robust networked supervisor. The second case is when the specifications are different, which is more general compared with the first case. In the second case, we can only obtain a sufficient condition for the existence of a networked supervisor. The results are illustrated by an example of customized products filling line. Note to Practitioners-Nowadays, it is very common to use networks to transmit information in complex engineering systems for all kinds of purposes, such as control, monitoring, and so on. Hence, we need to consider communication delays and losses when we design controllers/supervisors for these networked systems. One problem for these complex engineering systems is that we do not always know the specified model, only know that it is one of several possible models. For example, we may want to use the same supervisor to control different systems such as several machines. These facts motivate us to investigate the robust networked control problem of networked discrete event systems. The results of this paper can be used to guide the design of robust supervisors in a networked environment as we illustrate in this paper.

In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, intelligent vehicles will generate a lot of data. However, the limited computing power of in-vehicle terminals cannot meet the demand. To solve this problem, we first simulate the task offloading model of vehicle terminal in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environment. Secondly, according to the model, we design and implement a MEC server collaboration scheme considering both delay and energy consumption. Thirdly, based on the optimization theory, the system optimization solution is formulated with the goal of minimizing system cost. Because the problem to be resolved is a mixed binary nonlinear programming problem, we model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The original resource allocation decision is turned into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. In order to achieve the optimal solution, the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method is used. Finally, we propose a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to deal with task offloading and scheduling optimization in high-dimensional continuous action space, and the experience replay mechanism is used to accelerate the convergence and enhance the stability of the network. The simulation results show that our scheme has good performance optimization in terms of convergence, system delay, average task energy consumption and system cost. For example, compared with the comparison algorithm, the system cost performance has improved by 9.12% under different task sizes, which indicates that our scheme is more suitable for highly dynamic Internet of Vehicles environment.																			1570-8705	1570-8713				AUG 1	2023	147								103193	10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103193		MAY 2023											WOS:001005957400001

An approach for extracting a signed network from a weighted road network is proposed, and a walk-based balance index for urban road networks is developed. A probability matrix is adopted for the conversion between various land use types. Then a bi-level integrated mixed land-use transportation (IML-T) model is established, where the balance index is used as a parameter to correct the degree of mixed use. The upper-level is a multi-objective problem that considers total travel time, wider economic benefits, and a balanced internal capture rate, while the lower level involves the problem of user equilibrium (UE). The proposed method was validated through a sample network and the application to Handan City in China. The results indicate that the structure of the road network can be accurately measured by using a balance index. The local traffic property can be improved by choosing a mixed-use pattern given by the IML-T model. Moreover, the IML-T model is more efficient than traditional network design models at reducing the congestion caused by the distribution of the aggregated population.																			0733-9488	1943-5444				DEC 1	2021	147	4							04021048	10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000736													WOS:000708124500026

Firstly, the stochastic LQ Stackelberg game problem is converted into the deterministic problem by system transformation. Next, a value iteration ADP approach is put forword and the convergence is given. Thirdly, in order to implement the iterative method, back propagation neural network (BPNN) is chosen to design model network, critic network and action network to approximate the unknown systems, objective functions and Stackelberg strategies. Finally, simulation results show that the algorithm is effective.

Extended Dissipativity Performance for the Delayed Discrete-Time Neural Networks with Observer-Based Control	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS												This paper is concerned with the problem of extended dissipativity performance for a class of delayed discrete-time neural networks (DNNs) subject to state-feedback observer-based control design. To achieve this, a new improved summation based inequality is proposed by combining the Jensen-based summation inequality and an extended reciprocal convex matrix inequality so as to linearize the summable quadratic terms occurring in the forward difference of the constructed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF). The desired results ensuring the extended dissipativity performance for the observer-based error system have been established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by utilizing the developed summation based inequality. Further, the designed state-feedback and observer control gain matrices can be determined by solving the proposed LMIs. Finally, in order to analyze the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results, numerical examples including a quadruple tank process (QTP) system model have been illustrated with simulation results.

J	Chandwani, V; Agrawal, V; Nagar, R				Chandwani, Vinay; Agrawal, Vinay; Nagar, Ravindra			Modeling slump of ready mix concrete using genetic algorithms assisted training of Artificial Neural Networks	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												The paper explores the usefulness of hybridizing two distinct nature inspired computational intelligence techniques viz., Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) for modeling slump of Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) based on its design mix constituents viz., cement, fly ash, sand, coarse aggregates, admixture and water-binder ratio. The methodology utilizes the universal function approximation ability of ANN for imbibing the subtle relationships between the input and output variables and the stochastic search ability of GA for evolving the initial optimal weights and biases of the ANN to minimize the probability of neural network getting trapped at local minima and slowly converging to global optimum. The performance of hybrid model (ANN-GA) was compared with commonly used back-propagation neural network (BPNN) using six different statistical parameters. The study showed that by hybridizing ANN with GA, the convergence speed of ANN and its accuracy of prediction can be improved. The trained hybrid model can be used for predicting slump of concrete for a given concrete design mix in quick time without performing multiple trials with different design mix proportions.

The two main network components are the routers and the links connecting them. As these network elements have discrete capacity values, their costs are modeled by stepwise functions. In the current interpretation of the network design problem the subproblems of topological design, resource dimensioning, and routing of traffic flows are handled simultaneously. Using new network technologies (e.g., MPLS) the operators have the opportunity to reconfigure their networks dynamically. By using this function the periodic (e.g., daily, weekly) changes of traffic volumes and directions can be taken into consideration during network design resulting in lower deployment costs. The algorithm proposed for multi-hour design is based on an efficient, published method. The efficiency of the new algorithm is demonstrated by simulation on random and real network topologies with the help of two reference algorithms.																			0302-9743		3-540-21959-5				2004	3042						502	513																WOS:000221521000042

A mixed-integer programming approach to networked control systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND MODELING												This paper studies the problem of controller design for networked control systems regulated by a network data transmission protocol proposed in [50]. In this framework, the plant is first formulated as a mixed logical dynamical (MLD) system, then model predictive control (MPC) based on the mixed-integer programming is adopted to design a controller to guarantee certain control performance. It is shown that the solvability of the finite-horizon MPC is not equivalent to that of the infinite-horizon MPC, which is normally true for most existing MPC methods. The non-convexity feature of this type of networked control systems rules out explicit piecewise affine controllers that are designable for linear convex control systems. Notwithstanding these diffculties, controller design is still feasible due to the special nature of the data transmission strategy, i.e., only a small number of logic values are involved. Furthermore, control of higher-order systems and tracking of more complicated signals can be readily dealt with using this new approach. Two examples are presented to illustrate the strength of the proposed approach.

The objective is to design a network-based full-order or reduced-order filter, such that the resulting filtering error system is mean-square stable, while a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation levels is satisfied. A Markov chain is used to describe the network-induced delays. Then, a mode-dependent linear filter is considered, whose parameters are scheduled by the network-induced delays. By converting the partially unknown transition probability matrix to be a known convex description, and using the slack matrix approach, a new less conservative mode-dependent sufficient condition for the existence of the desired filter is derived to guarantee that the filtering error system is stochastically stable while satisfying a given H-infinity performance. Based on this condition, the filter design method is proposed, and by solving some convex linear matrix inequalities, the explicit of the desired filer gain matrices is also given. Finally, a practical example is included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A three-dimensional, discrete-continuum model of blood pressure in microvascular networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING												We present a 3D discrete-continuum model to simulate blood pressure in large microvascular tissues in the absence of known capillary network architecture. Our hybrid approach combines a 1D Poiseuille flow description for large, discrete arteriolar and venular networks coupled to a continuum-based Darcy model, point sources of flux, for transport in the capillary bed. We evaluate our hybrid approach using a vascular network imaged from the mouse brain medulla/pons using multi-fluorescence high-resolution episcopic microscopy (MF-HREM). We use the fully-resolved vascular network to predict the hydraulic conductivity of the capillary network and generate a fully-discrete pressure solution to benchmark against. Our results demonstrate that the discrete-continuum methodology is a computationally feasible and effective tool for predicting blood pressure in real-world microvascular tissues when capillary microvessels are poorly defined. Facing limitations in the spatial resolution of in vivo imaging for microvascular networks, this study presents a 3D hybrid model designed to simulate blood pressure accurately with incomplete vessel structure information. By integrating discrete blood flow modelling in larger vessels with a continuum approach for the capillary bed, the model adeptly navigates the challenges of partial data, offering a novel pathway for investigating vascular function where capillary network architecture is unknown. image																			2040-7939	2040-7947				2024 MAY 21	2024										10.1002/cnm.3832	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cnm.3832		MAY 2024						38770788					WOS:001227647100001

For this notion, the complex-valued filter scheme is designed for the proposed uncertain DTNNs with regard to the available output measurements. At first, some novel complex-valued weighted summation inequalities (WSIs) are put forth to establish a more precise linearized lower bound for the quadratic summing terms resulting from the forward difference of the assigned Lyapunov- Krasovskii functional (LKF). In what follows, an attempt has been made to propose the linear matrix inequality (LMI) based sufficient conditions for designing the robust H. filter from the filtering error system attains exponential stability with the appropriate filtering gain matrices. Eventually, the theoretical conclusion is substantiated through a numerical example and the simulation outcomes reveal the applicability and efficiency of the proposed filter scheme.

Firstly, a class of nonfragile proportional-integral state estimator with exponential type linear polynomial on time-varying delay is presented, which unifies the Arcak state estimator and the Luenberger state estimator as its special cases. Since the exponential type linear polynomial on time-varying delay is considered, more information of time delay can be utilized and the estimation error convergence rate can be adjusted. Secondly, an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional tailored for delayed discrete-time neural networks is presented, in which the double summation terms of the state vector and the information of the output estimation error are fully considered in the corresponding augmented vector, then a sufficient criterion that guarantees the nonfragile extended dissipativity state estimation for delayed discrete-time neural networks is derived. Furthermore, since an extended dissipativity performance level is introduced, the issues of passitivity state estimation, H-infinity state estimation, L-2 similar to L-infinity state estimation, and (Q, S, R)-gamma dissipativity state estimation can be solved in a unified framework. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the advantage of the presented method. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By constructing the self-feedback matrix and the neighbouring feedback matrix for networks, consensus protocols are designed under three different cases and the corresponding convergence analysis is provided. Consensus convergence results of networks are provided by three final consensus values, which are related to self-feedback matrices, initial states of networks and the topology of networks, not related to time delays. In the first case where a directed network with a fixed topology is concerned, the high-order discrete-time consensus problem is studied as an example, and a sufficient and necessary condition is obtained. In the scenario with directed networks with switching topology, a sufficient condition guaranteeing the consensus of high-order D-NMAS is derived, after the consensus analysis is transformed into stability analysis. As for directed networks with switching topology and time delays, the discrete-time stability model with time delays is converted into a general discrete-time stability model by an augmented method and the sufficient condition is provided to achieve consensus for directed networks. Furthermore, the sufficient conditions determining the neighbouring feedback matrix are independent of the number of agents. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the theoretical results.					zeng, jing/JDW-4350-2023														0142-3312	1477-0369				AUG	2017	39	8					1182	1194		10.1177/0142331216629197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0142331216629197													WOS:000406541900006

In order to solve the noncausal problem, the original system is transformed into a predictor form. Different from the existing methods for the investigated system, all unknown parts at internship steps are passed down in the discrete-time backstepping design procedure, and only one single neural network is used to approximate the lumped unknown function in the system at the last step. Following this approach, the designed controller contains only one actual control law and one adaptive law. Compared with the existing results for discrete-time systems, the proposed controller is simpler and the computational burden is lighter. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero by choosing the control parameters appropriately. Simulation examples are employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The NN backstepping approach is utilized to design the adaptive output feedback controller consisting of: 1) a NN observer to estimate the system states with the input-output data, and 2) two NNs to generate the virtual and actual control inputs, respectively. The non-causal problem in the discrete-time backstepping design is avoided by using the universal NN approximator. The persistence excitation (PE) condition is relaxed both in the NN observer and NN controller design. The uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop tracking error, the state estimation errors and the NN weight estimates is shown.																			0743-1619		0-7803-8335-4				2004							2439	2444																WOS:000224688300416

This paper addresses the verification of current-state, initial-state, infinite-step, and $K$-step opacity of networked discrete event systems modeled by labeled Petri nets, where communication losses and delays are considered. Based on the symbolic technique for the representation of states in Petri nets, an observer and an estimator are designed for the verification of current-state and initial-state opacity, respectively. Then, we propose a structure called an I-observer that is combined with secret states to verify whether a networked discrete event system is infinite-step opaque or $K$-step opaque. Due to the utilization of symbolic approaches for the state-based opacity verification, the computation of the reachability graphs of labeled Petri nets is avoided, which dramatically reduces the computational overheads stemming from networked discrete event systems.

In this study, we show that nilpotent logical systems offer an appropriate mathematical framework for hybridization of continuous nilpotent logic and neural models, helping to improve the interpretability and safety of machine learning. In our concept, perceptrons model soft inequalities; namely membership functions and continuous logical operators. We design the network architecture before training, using continuous logical operators and multicriteria decision tools with given weights working in the hidden layers. Designing the structure appropriately leads to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters to be learned. The theoretical basis offers a straightforward choice of activation functions (the cutting function or its differentiable approximation, the squashing function), and also suggests an explanation to the great success of the rectified linear unit (ReLU). In this study, we focus on the architecture of a hybrid model and introduce the building blocks for future applications in deep neural networks. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of the controller is to make the altitude and velocity to follow a given desired trajectory in the presence of aerodynamic uncertainties. Based on the functional decomposition, the adaptive discrete-time nonlinear controllers are developed using feedback linearization and neural approximation for the two subsystems. Different from the back-stepping design, the altitude subsystem is transformed into the explicit four-step ahead prediction model. With the prediction model, the controller is proposed without virtual controller design. Furthermore, only one direct neural network (NN) is employed for the lumped system uncertainty approximation. The controller is considerably simpler than the ones based on back-stepping scheme and the algorithm needs less NN parameters to be adjusted online. The semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) stability is investigated by the discrete-time Lyapunov analysis and the output tracking error is made within a neighborhood of zero. Accordingly, the NN controller is designed for velocity subsystem. The simulation is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Through the first step of the proposed procedure, we design a CNN in software with a minimized number of channels for each layer while satisfying the network performance to the target, which creates low representational and computational cost. Then, the network is reconstructed and retrained with a single modular neuron that is recursively utilized for the entire network for the maximum hardware efficiency with a fixed number of parameters that consider signal attenuation. For the last step of the proposed procedure, the parameters of the networks are quantized to an implementable level of MS neurons. We designed the networks for MNIST and Cifar-10 and achieved compact CNNs with a single MS neuron with 97% accuracy for MNIST and 85% accuracy for Cifar-10 whose representational cost and computational cost are reduced to least two times smaller than prior works. The estimated energy per classification of the hardware network for Cifar-10 with a single MS neuron, designed with optimum noise and matching requirements, is 0.5 mu J, which is five times smaller than its digital counterpart.																			1549-8328	1558-0806				DEC	2020	67	12					5189	5199		10.1109/TCSI.2020.3007447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2020.3007447													WOS:000596021000085

A recent strategy to tackle this difficulty consists in exploiting the connection between discrete differential geometry and constructive properties to identify curve networks with good fabrication or mechanical properties. Following this approach, a family of surfaces, called Voss surfaces, is here presented. Among other features, they can be built from flat panels, initially flat straight strips, and hinged connections. These properties arise from the existence of a conjugate network of geodesic curves. Two generation methods are presented to shape discrete Voss surfaces: the first allows their exploration through linear spaces; the second provides a unique solution by means of a direct computation. Applications of the generated shapes to architecture are presented. They illustrate the potential of discrete Voss surfaces for the design of doubly curved structures.						olivier, baverel/0000-0001-6360-8169													0926-5805	1872-7891				AUG	2022	140								104200	10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104200		MAY 2022											WOS:000812357600001

To achieve quasi synchronization, the average of states of all nodes is designed as the virtual target. Heterogeneous complex networks with two kinds of nonlinear node dynamics are analyzed firstly. Some sufficient conditions on quasi synchronization are obtained without designing any external controller. Quasi synchronization means that the states of all nonidentical nodes will keep a bounded error with the virtual target. Then the heterogeneous complex network with impulsive coupling which means the network only has coupling at some discrete impulsive instants, is further discussed. Some sufficient conditions on heterogeneous complex network with impulsive coupling are derived. Based on these results, heterogeneous complex network can still reach quasi synchronization even if its nodes are only coupled at discrete impulsive instants. Finally, two examples are provided to verify the theoretical results. (C) 2017 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Besides, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided MEC system can further enhance the spectral efficiency with massive tasks offloading. However, with more dynamic devices brought online and the uncontrollable stochastic channel environment, it is even desirable to deploy appealing technique, i.e., intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), in the MEC system to flexibly tune the communication environment and improve the system energy efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the joint offloading, communication and computation resource allocation for the IRS-assisted NOMA MEC system. We first formulate a mixed integer energy efficiency maximization problem with system queue stability constraint. We then propose the Lyapunov-function-based Mixed Integer Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (LMIDDPG) algorithm which is based on the centralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework. To be specific, we design the mixed integer action space mapping which contains both continuous mapping and integer mapping. Moreover, the award function is defined as the upper-bound of the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function. To enable end devices (EDs) to choose actions independently at the execution stage, we further propose the Heterogeneous Multi-agent LMIDDPG (HMA-LMIDDPG) algorithm based on distributed RL framework with homogeneous EDs and heterogeneous base station (BS) as heterogeneous multi-agent. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms can achieve superior energy efficiency performance to the benchmark algorithms while maintaining the queue stability. Specially, the distributed structure HMA-LMIDDPG can acquire more energy efficiency gain than the centralized structure LMIDDPG.					sun, bo/JFA-9978-2023; Wen, Jing/KCL-6614-2024; Li, Xiaoli/JVZ-4089-2024; Chen, GuanYu/KGK-6328-2024; wang, yifang/KEI-3766-2024; chen, yue/JXW-9556-2024; Yu, Jiadong/GLS-8218-2022	, YANG/0000-0003-3720-7729; Liu, Xiaolan/0000-0002-7500-9128													1536-1276	1558-2248				JUL	2023	22	7					4296	4312		10.1109/TWC.2022.3224291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2022.3224291													WOS:001029070100002

The advantages of the neural networks, as one of the main artificial intelligence methods, make them very appropriate for different engineering design problems. However, the qualitative properties of the neural networks' states are extremely important for their design and practical performance. In addition, the variety of neural network models requires the formulation of appropriate qualitative criteria. This paper studies a class of discrete Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) neural networks of the Cohen-Grossberg type that can be applied in engineering design. Due to the nature of the proposed models, they are very suitable for symmetry-related problems. The notion of the practical stability of the states with respect to sets is introduced. The practical stability analysis is conducted by the method of the Lyapunov functions. Examples are presented to verify the proposed criteria and demonstrate the efficiency of the results. Since engineering design is a constrained processes, the obtained stability of the sets' results can be applied to numerous engineering design tasks of diverse interest.																				2073-8994				FEB	2022	14	2							216	10.3390/sym14020216	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym14020216													WOS:000764293200001

Initially, the discrete cosine transform and discrete wavelet transform efficiently removed the high-frequency noise. The six encoder layers then retain important electrocardiography features, whereas the six decoder layers reconstruct the clean electrocardiography. To improve the denoising performance, two network layers, the residual block and pixel adjustment, are added to the encoder and decoder layers to solve the vanishing gradient and improve subtle feature extraction. The proposed methods were applied to 66,000 real-recorded noisy electrocardiography fragments.

In this paper, we investigated robust control of such systems, which is useful when the exact model of the plant is unknown or when one supervisor is designed to control many different but similar plants. We consider nondeterministic control, where the language generated by the closed-loop system is not unique. We use predictive control that takes control delays and losses into consideration. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of predictive supervisors are derived. Examples are given to illustrate the results.

A new systematic methodology has been developed for targeting and design that simultaneously minimises the requirements of energy and water. Using this new approach, the design of a water system for maximum energy recovery can be achieved, taking into account the mixing opportunities offered by water networks, while maintaining the water quality to processes in terms of contamination. Direct and indirect energy recovery are analysed and a strategy developed to decrease the number of heat transfer units based on the generation of separate systems and non-isothermal stream mixing. Initially, the analysis is restricted to no water re-use. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The optimized neural network model with tansig transfer function in hidden layers has an architecture of 7-85-85-1 and it predicts the mixing efficiency of the induced charge electrokinetic micromixer with the maximum deviation of 2.74 %. Global sensitivity of the artificial neural network model is assessed using Shapley values and it is found that length of the conducting link is the most influencing parameter for designing induced charge electrokinetic micromixer. If more than one conducting links are employed, the pitch transverse to fluid flow is more critical than pitch along the fluid flow direction in mixing zone. Pseudoplastic fluids, marked by pronounced microvortices, exhibit superior mixing efficiency, and accelerated mixing at higher electric field strengths compared to dilatant fluids, achieving a mixing efficiency exceeding 99 %. The optimized artificial neural network model predicts mixing efficiency significantly faster compared to computational fluid dynamics and conclusively demonstrates its ability to expedite the design process for electrokinetic micromixers.																			0952-1976	1873-6769				JUL	2024	133		D						108371	10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108371													WOS:001226044500001

To solve this objective control problem, the controller-coding co-design approach is adopted, i.e. the controller, encoder and decoder are designed for taking full advantage of the network resource collaboratively, thereby achieving better transmission of control signals. A stabilisability condition in the mean square sense that reveals the fundamental limitation among the H-2 norm of the plant, data arrival rates and coding matrices is first derived. Then, a solvability condition is conducted to handle the additional stochastic LQ control objective by a modified discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation, and an iterative algorithm is also given for designing the corresponding state feedback gain and coding matrices. Relied on such design, the asymptotic tracking constraint is further fulfilled through solving a Sylvester equation, and the feedforward gain related to tracking is parameterised. Finally, a simulation with the implementation of the design method on two cooperative robots is included to show the effectiveness of the current results.

Design requirements of the N-way balanced-to-balanced series feeding (BBSF) network are extracted and mixed-mode S-parameters are expressed by using matrix transformation. Designing the BBSF network without using baluns at input and output paths of the network results in the compact and low-loss feeding network, while maintaining the common-mode suppression feature. Furthermore, to have a planar BBSF network, microstrip crossovers are utilized to avoid the use of multilayer PCB design, resulting in the elegant transfer of intersecting RF signals. To validate the proposed structure, a three-way BBSF network is fabricated which shows acceptable mixed-mode measurement results. Also, to demonstrate the performance of the proposed structure, a balanced frequency-scanning phased array is designed employing the proposed feeding network. The measurement results of the fabricated array show that the differential return loss and the differential mode to common mode conversions are better than 20 and 30 dB at 5.85 GHz, respectively. Meanwhile, the fabricated array shows a wide-range beam-scanning capability over its frequency band.

An observer-based fault detection filter and a reference residual model are introduced to construct a novel model for the continuous-time NCS. To reduce the time for fault detection, a new data reconstruction scheme is proposed and the corresponding closed-loop model is established. Based on the established models, new fault detection filter design criteria are derived to asymptotically stabilize the residual system. The mutually exclusive distribution characteristic of interval time-varying delays is made full use to deal with integral inequalities for products of vectors. The designed fault detection filters can guarantee the sensitivity of the residual signal to faults. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed observer-based fault detection filter design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

LEA® (Low Energy Asphalt):: A new generation of half-warm asphalt mixtures	ADVANCED CHARACTERISATION OF PAVEMENT SOIL ENGINEERING MATERIALS, VOLS 1 AND 2	Proceedings and Monographs in Engineering Water and Earth Sciences				International Conference on Advanced Characterisation of Pavement and Soil Engineering Materials	JUN 20-22, 2007	Athens, GREECE	Natl Tech Univ Athens, Delft Univ Technol, Univ Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Hellen Soc Pavement Engn Res, Int Soc Asphalt Pavements, Int Soc Concrete Pavements				Several low-energy coating patented techniques have been recently developed by EIFFAGE Travaux Publics and FAIRCO. Since 2006, these two groups have been sharing their respective patents within a joint subsidiary company named LEA-Co. LEA(R) (low energy asphalt) mix consists of an alternative to usual hot mix asphalt (HMA) and it makes it possible, thanks to its specific manufacturing process, to lower operating temperatures by about 70 degrees C. Indeed, LEA(R) is produced on standard HMA plants - either continuous or discontinuous plants - at about 95 degrees C. The LEA(R) process enables a saving of in-plant energy consumption ranging from 30 to 50% and a reduction of the greenhouse gases in the same order of magnitude. This eco-product results from a research program conducted on the binder, most often modified with some additives, and on the process optimisation on the different kinds of plants. After their development in tab since 2002, sixty LEA(R) paving trials and road works were carried out successfully on reference sites throughout the years 2004-06. As LEA(R) holds the potential for further implementation in any kind of plants and pavement layers, it is proposed to building owners, prime contractors, asphalt producers and equipment manufacturers as a new asphalt mix generation. Eventually, in addition to their ecological and economical nature, this paper sets out a performance assessment of LEA(R) in accordance with the standard characterization tests traditionally used for designing HMA in France. Some examples of mixtures for sub-grade course, base course, binder course and wearing course, according to the type of road network, validated both in lab and on road site, are presented in details.																					978-0-415-44882-6				2007							1371	1381																WOS:000252193600122

J	Oune, N; Bostanabad, R				Oune, Nicholas; Bostanabad, Ramin			Latent map Gaussian processes for mixed variable metamodeling	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING												Gaussian processes (GPs) are ubiquitously used in sciences and engineering as metamodels. Standard GPs, however, can only handle numerical or quantitative variables. In this paper, we introduce latent map Gaussian processes (LMGPs) that inherit the attractive properties of GPs and are also applicable to mixed data which have both quantitative and qualitative inputs. The core idea behind LMGPs is to learn a continuous, low-dimensional latent space or manifold which encodes all qualitative inputs. To learn this manifold, we first assign a unique prior vector representation to each combination of qualitative inputs. We then use a low-rank linear map to project these priors on a manifold that characterizes the posterior representations. As the posteriors are quantitative, they can be directly used in any standard correlation function such as the Gaussian or Matern. Hence, the optimal map and the corresponding manifold, along with other hyperparameters of the correlation function, can be systematically learned via maximum likelihood estimation. Through a wide range of analytic and real-world examples, we demonstrate the advantages of LMGPs over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and versatility. In particular, we show that LMGPs can handle variable-length inputs, have an explainable neural network interpretation, and provide insights into how qualitative inputs affect the response or interact with each other. We also employ LMGPs in Bayesian optimization and illustrate that they can discover optimal compound compositions more efficiently than conventional methods that convert compositions to qualitative variables via manual featurization.

Classifying High Strength Concrete Mix Design Methods Using Decision Trees	MATERIALS												Concrete mix design methods are used to determine proportions of concrete ingredients needed for certain workability and strength. Each mix design method operates under certain assumptions and suggests slightly different proportions. It is of great importance that site/construction engineers know the method by which the mix was designed. However, it can be difficult to know the designing method based solely on mix proportions. Hence, in this work, a decision trees model was used to classify high strength concrete mix design methods based on their produced concrete mix proportions. It was found that the trained decision tree model is capable of classifying mix design methods with high accuracy. Further, based on dimensionality reduction methods, the amount of cement in a concrete mix was found to be the paramount predictor of the used mix design method. In this work, a novel high-accuracy model for determining a mix design method based only on mix proportion is proposed.																				1996-1944				MAR	2022	15	5							1950	10.3390/ma15051950	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma15051950								35269181					WOS:000771752400001

Enhancing Public Health Messaging: Discrete-Choice Experiment Evidence on the Design of HIV Testing Messages in China	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING												Introduction. While a growing literature documents the effectiveness of public health messaging on social media, our understanding of the factors that encourage individuals to engage with and share messages is limited. In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China, rising incidence and low testing rates despite decades of interventions suggest the need for effective, targeted messaging to reach underserved populations. Social media platforms and sex-seeking apps present a promising avenue, as web-based strategies can take advantage of existing trust within dense social networks. Methods. We conducted an online discrete-choice experiment in January 2017 with MSM from across China. Participants were presented with 6 choice tasks, each composed of 2 messages about HIV testing, and were asked in which scenario they were more likely to share the content. Participants were given information about the source of the HIV testing message, the social media sharing platform, and the recipients with whom they would share the message. They were given the option of sharing 1 message or neither. Multinomial and mixed logit models were used to model preferences within 4 subgroups. Results. In total, 885 MSM joined the survey, completing 4387 choice tasks. The most important attribute for 3 of the 4 subgroups was social media sharing platform. Men were more willing to share messages on sex-seeking mobile applications and less willing to share materials on generic (non-MSM) social media platforms. We found that men with more active online presences were less willing to share HIV testing messages on generic social media platforms. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that sex-seeking platforms represent a targeted, efficient method of actively engaging MSM in public health interventions.					tang, wei/HZH-5205-2023; Tang, Wei/IZQ-1283-2023; Liu, Chuncheng/AAF-4013-2019; Ong, Jason J/AAB-3086-2019	Liu, Chuncheng/0000-0001-5842-7988; Ong, Jason J/0000-0001-5784-7403; Terris-Prestholt, Fern/0000-0003-1693-5196; Cao, Bolin/0000-0001-8743-1361													0272-989X	1552-681X				JUL	2019	39	5					568	582	0272989X19859344	10.1177/0272989X19859344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0272989X19859344		JUL 2019						31354096					WOS:000479403600001

The factors considered in the model include the cost of collection, disassembly and treatment, processing capacity, sales income from material fractions after disassembly, as well as recycling subsidy. finally, a few of issues requiring further research are highlighted.					zhang, ling/JXW-6931-2024														1022-6680		978-3-03785-370-2				2012	472-475						3380	3383		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.472-475.3380	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.472-475.3380													WOS:000310938501323

This method employs a simultaneous model and includes two design steps. In the first step, the water allocation network (WAN), which could achieve the targets of saving water and energy, is obtained by taking account the temperature factor into the design procedure. The optimized targets of both freshwater and energy are reached at this step which ensures this approach is a simultaneous one. In the second step, based on the obtained WAN, the whole water allocation and heat exchange network (WAHEN) is combined with the non-isothermal mixing to reduce the number of heat exchangers. The thus obtained WAHEN can achieve three optimization targets (minimization of water, energy and the number of heat exchangers). Furthermore, the effectivity of our method has been demonstrated by solving two literature examples.

It is constructed using conventional trisection filtering topology, with all the couplings between adjacent resonators being implemented with controllable mixed electric-magnetic couplings. This not only achieves a reconfigurable filtering response but also forms an intrinsic I/Q signal generator inside the filter, which can be directly utilized to achieve continuous phase control based on the vector-sum mechanism. In such a manner, an integrated filtering phase shifter (FPS) without the need for an extra I/Q generation network and individual filtering device is obtained. By properly choosing the coupling types and coupling strengths between adjacent resonators, a continuous phase control from 0 degrees to 360 degrees, covering the full four quadrants, is successfully realized. Closed-form equations associating the circuit parameters and insertion phase at center frequency are deduced, providing a quantitative theoretical guideline for determining the parameters of the FPS. Subsequently, a novel tuning mechanism for independent Q-factor and resonant frequency control of the resonator is proposed and applied in the circuit to further exploit the amplitude control ability of the phase shifter. Measured results show that the proposed amplitude-variable FPS is capable of achieving a continuous phase control range of 360 degrees and an amplitude control range of 10 dB within a center frequency tuning range of 0.75-0.95 GHz. The measured root-mean-square (rms) amplitude error and the rms phase error are less than 2.58 dB and 8.45 degrees, respectively.					xu, rui/GRX-5734-2022	zhu, xu/0000-0003-4276-7691; Chi, Pei-Ling/0000-0001-9515-4317													0018-9480	1557-9670				JUL	2022	70	7					3511	3523		10.1109/TMTT.2022.3173729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2022.3173729		MAY 2022											WOS:000800770400001

The previous data mining techniques can't directly be used in the sensor data mining because of these properties of sensor data. Also, most of application services in the sensor network are only event alert services which perceive the events from sensors and alert the events to the supervisor. In this paper, we define continuous sensor data mining model and design a system based on the model. The system can service useful knowledge by continuous sensor data mining using gathered data from sensor in the sensor network. First, we classify sensor data to the three data types, which are each simple sensor data, continuous sensor data, and sensor event data, and define sensor data mining models about outlier analysis, pattern analysis, and prediction analysis. After the definition of model, we design a system which can be used in application services like u-Silvercare, Sea Ranching Program, City Environment Management, etc., based on these mining models in sensor network environment.

In order to achieve repetitive tracking control of the nonaffine structure systems with uncertain control direction, randomly varying trail length, and other uncertainties, we apply a high-order neural network to approximate the expected system input. Then, a novel adaptation law is designed for the neural network weight vector. The main feature of the method proposed in this paper is that the weight vector norm instead of the weight vector itself is updated iteratively to realize the successive approximation of the expected system input, the custom-designed identification mechanism is not necessary to deal with the uncertain control direction, and the analysis of randomly varying trail lengths problem is strictly established. The convergence of the proposed adaptive ILC is set up by a composite energy function. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive ILC design is validated by two simulation examples.

Under pressure to do more with less, institutes of HE are increasingly adopting the tools and methods of lean to improve their quality practices. Nevertheless, institutes of HE differ significantly from business organizations. The purpose of this study was to examine the critical success factors (CSFs) of continuous improvement in this homogeneous industry. Two other contextual factors, implementation approach and national culture, are examined. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods approach, combining Q-methodology, online surveys and interviews, was used to investigate the CSFs of lean implementation in HE. Participants were recruited from an international network of lean practitioners in HE. Using Q-methodology, three perspectives of CSFs in HE were identified. Findings Lean implementation at institutes of HE is characterized by a bottom-up approach, involving mostly supporting processes. Contrary to business organizations, the role of management in the implementation of Lean in HE is limited and attention should instead be directed to employee empowerment and customer focus. The findings also showed that, at least for institutes of HE, organizational culture is more influential than national culture. Practical implications When management involvement is limited, a bottom-up implementation of lean is recommended, centered on improving university-wide supporting processes, promoting cross-departmental cooperation and overcoming the silo mentality. This approach requires an emphasis on a specific set of CSFs, namely, employee empowerment, sharing success stories and training. Originality/value The study findings enrich conceptually based lean implementation frameworks for HE that advocate a top-down implementation approach.

A novel model of the systems is proposed by a sector bounded approach where the internal effects of network induced delay and signals quantization are considered. By using Lyapunov functional approach, together with introducing relaxation variables technique, sufficient conditions for quantized SOP stabilizing controller design are given. Since the obtained conditions are not expressed strictly in term of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the quantized SOP controller is solved by using modified cone complementary linearization (CCL) algorithm. In addition, the obtained conditions of stability analysis and SOP stabilization for discrete-time NCSs in absence of quantization are proved to be less conservative than some existing results.

Robust exponential stability for discrete-time interval BAM neural networks with delays and Markovian jump parameters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING												This paper investigates the problem of global robust exponential stability for discrete-time interval BAM neural networks with mode-dependent time delays and Markovian jump parameters, by utilizing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. A new Markov process as discrete-time, discrete-state Markov process is considered. An exponential stability performance analysis result is first established for error systems without ignoring any terms in the derivative of Lyapunov functional by considering the relationship between the time-varying delay and its upper bound. The delay factor depends on the mode of operation. Three numerical examples are given to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

What is often called the practice-turn, however, has not reached research on interorganizational networks. This is mainly due to methodological issues that call, in the end, for a mixed-method approach. This article addresses this issue by proposing a research design that balances well-established social network analysis with a set of techniques of organizational ethnography that fit with the specifics of interorganizational networks. In what we call network ethnography, qualitative and quantitative data are collected and analyzed in a parallel fashion.

The gain matrix of the filter can be derived from the solution of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the simulation proves the availability of the proposed approach.																			2161-2927						2013							3281	3287																WOS:000393046003080

New Method for Industrial Water Reuse and Energy Minimization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Water and energy are, key commodities utilized in the process industries. Water minimization and energy minimization have been studied separately In this paper, a new systematic design methodology has been developed for the simultaneous management of energy and water systems that also feature maximum re-use of water. In addition to allowing re-use of water, issues about heat losses inside unit operations have also been incorporated in this new design method. To implement such a design, two new design aspects are introduced; new method for "Non-isothermal Mixing" points identification and new "Separate System" generation. The first aspect involves "non-isothermal mixing", which enables direct heat recovery between water streams, and therefore allows the reduction of the number of heat transfer units. An NLP model is formulated to identify feasible non-isothermal mixing points in the network regarding minimum operation cost, which satisfy minimum freshwater and utility requirements. The other aspect is the generation of "separate system" in heat exchanger network design. The flexibility of mixing and splitting of water streams allows separate systems to be created as a cost-efficient series of heat exchanger units between freshwater and wastewater streams. The new design aspects have been illustrated with an example.						Panjeshahi, M.

F. bay) considering maximum-monitoring-information and minimum-data-lost criteria. Due to cost concerns, it is necessary to design the optimal salinity monitoring network with a minimal number of sampling stations to provide reliable data. The monthly data recorded from January 1995 to December 2014 were obtained over 37 active stations located in S. F. bay and is applied in the research. Transinformation entropy in discrete mode is used to calculate the stations' optimum distance. The discrete approach uses the frequency table to calculate transinformation measures. After calculating these measures, a transinformation-distance (T-D) curve is developed. Then, the optimum distance between salinity monitoring stations is elicited from the curve. The study shows that the S. F. bay salinity monitoring stations provide redundant information and the existing stations can be reduced to 21 with an approximate distance of 7.5 km. The coverage of the proposed monitoring network by using the optimum distance is complete and the system does not generate redundant data. The results of this research indicate that transinformation entropy is a promising method for the design of monitoring networks in bays such as those found in San Francisco bay.

Based on sliding control theory, the proposed autopilot utilizes a fuzzy basis function network to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions of bank-to-turn missile dynamics, enabling a mixed H-2/H-infinity controller with weight updating laws to be applied to attenuate the effects of approximation errors and external disturbances. Moreover, the mixed H-2/H-infinity autopilot design can minimize H-2 performance criteria under a desired Hoc disturbance rejection constraint. Unlike general mixed H-2/H-infinity control problems, the proposed H-2/H-infinity autopilot with self-tuning fuzzy basis function network can avoid solving coupled Riccati equations by adequately selecting diagonal weighting matrices in the H-2 performance criterion and Hoc constraint. Therefore, the proposed H-2/H-infinity control approach can be implemented efficiently.

J	Sengupta, N; Kasabov, N				Sengupta, Neelava; Kasabov, Nikola			Spike-time encoding as a data compression technique for pattern recognition of temporal data	INFORMATION SCIENCES												The human brain's ability to efficiently detect patterns from the continuous streaming sensory stimuli has been a source of constant intrigue for naturalists, and has set the course for the development of research into artificial intelligence. Efficient encoding of such input stimuli into discrete timing of events play a decisive role in the ability of the spiking neurons inside the human brain to compress, transmit and recognise information presented by the external environment. In this article, we introduce the spike-time or temporal encoding paradigm as an efficient general approach to data compression for the purpose of pattern recognition. The data compression through spike-time encoding not only dramatically reduces the volume of data required to capture discriminatory information leading to economical storage and transmission, but can also be used for pattern recognition in streaming data domain. We experimentally show that the spike-time data produced by the temporal encoding techniques achieve comparable (superior in some cases) performance of pattern recognition in comparison to the use of the whole raw data. This article also introduces a generalised background knowledge driven optimisation based temporal encoding framework for encoding time series data and as an illustration of this approach, further formulates a temporal encoding algorithm, namely GAGamma, designed to efficiently compress fMRI data using discrete spike-times. We have evaluated the temporal encoding algorithms on the benchmark Starplus fMRI dataset, and the results demonstrate the temporal encoding algorithm's ability to achieve significant data compression without sacrificing the performance of the pattern recognition in the compressed space. We also show that the GAGamma algorithm provides enhanced flexibility and control (compared to the state of the art temporal encoding algorithms) within the design framework of the temporal encoding problem for fMRI, leading to better quality of spike-time data. The proposed approach, by the use of efficient brain-like encoding mechanism, opens up new possibilities in information compression, communication and pattern recognition and thus is applicable to a range of new applications.

It is therefore crucial to accurately estimate the node energy consumption throughout the WSN design phases, particularly in the network layout optimization. In this paper, the node energy consumption is estimated with a discrete-event network simulation that provides realistic estimation values by capturing the dynamics of wireless communication protocols. A non-trivial WSN simulation requires a significant amount of time which can adversely affect the overall result of the layout optimization. Therefore, the network is simulated with a balanced simulation granularity to achieve high estimation accuracy and low computational complexity. A case study of Structural Health Monitoring is conducted to evaluate the discrete-event simulation approach. We compare the optimization results with those obtained in a previous work where the network energy consumption is obtained via simple communication models.																					978-1-4799-4266-4				2014							238	242		10.1109/U-MEDIA.2014.34	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/U-MEDIA.2014.34													WOS:000352622200046

Redundancy in monitoring network results in economic and overall inefficiency of the network. Therefore, redundancy reduction is an important issue in the optimal design of a monitoring network. The developed methodology reduces monitoring redundancy. It incorporates the inverse distance weighting method for spatial interpolation of concentration data. The formulated logic-based mixed-integer linear optimization model is solved using the branch-and-bound algorithm. The proposed methodology is tested for a real world problem. Performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated for different scenarios using available historical concentration data. These performance evaluation results show that the proposed methodology performs satisfactorily when compared with other existing methodologies. These results demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed methodology for groundwater contaminant monitoring network design, while incorporating reduction in redundancy of monitoring locations.

Proposed adaptive Kohonen neural network (ADKNN) are used to minimize the error between output and target signal for nonlinear discrete-time systems. The ADKNN is a feed-forward neural network help for approximation of the nonlinearities in the industrial plant and main characteristic of the system is taken into account is disturbances in the system. Tracking error by the adaptive ADKNN based approximation system is an important characteristic for the design and analysis. It is shown in results that the preference of the error system is decisive to the solution of tracking control.

The packet dropouts and network-induced delays in the sensor-to-controller (S-C) channel and network-induced delays in the controller-to-actuator (C-A) channel are taken into full consideration. By taking the non-uniform distribution characteristic of the arrival instants of actually adopted controller inputs into account, a new model for continuous-time NCSs is established.

However, the free topology is vulnerable to any single link/component failure. There are several strategies in designing a reliable network topology. This paper gives reliability analysis of typical wireless access network topologies, which are spanning tree, ring and multi-ring. We present a reliable network design model for wireless backhaul network design based on the multi-ring network topology.

The unavoidable network-induced random delay is modeled by a Markov chain with the uncertain transition probability. In this paper, the experimental linear motion control system is a double-sided linear switched reluctance machine (DLSRM). To tackle the external disturbances in the DLSRM, an H-infinity control strategy is designed by using Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequalities technique. A mode-dependent state feedback H-infinity controller is designed for the closed-loop discrete-time direct-drive linear motion control system over a network to achieve a high-precision position control performance with antidisturbance capability.

First. a general method to design convenient ISL topologies for connection-oriented operation is presented, and a reference topology for numerical studies is derived. A permanent virtual topology is then defined on top of the orbiting physical one. thus forming a framework for discrete-time dynamic traffic routing. On this basis. heuristic and optimization approaches for the combined routing and dimensioning task, operating on discrete time steps, are presented and their performance is numerically compared. It is shown that minimizing the worst-case link capacity is an appropriate target function, which can be formulated as linear optimization problem with [in-ear constraints. Using linear programming (LP) techniques, the dimensioning results are clearly better than with simple heuristic approaches.

A stronger, more dynamic network is an SDN network, which is precisely what a smart city network must be if it wants to be viable on a real-world scale. SDN architecture is developed to implement a learning framework for network optimization. The proposed method is called mixed-integer and reinforcement learned network optimization (MI-RLNO) for SDN monitoring. In the first phase, mixed-integer programming formulation is used as an optimization formulation for latency and convergence time. In the second phase, a reinforced Q Learning model is designed that uses communication and computation time as input state vector. Optimization formulation is used as the actions and strategies to be followed during the design and operation of communication networks, therefore contributing fairness and throughput.

Mix design of special concrete is always tedious, particularly without standards. Researchers used several artificial intelligence tools to analyze and design the special concrete. This paper attempts to design the material EGC through an artificial neural network with a cross-validation technique to achieve the desired compressive and tensile strength. A database was formulated with seven mix-design influencing factors collected from the literature. The five best artificial neural network (ANN) models were trained and analyzed. A gradient descent momentum and adaptive learning rate backpropagation (GDX)-based ANN was developed to cross-validate those five best models. Upon regression analysis, ANN [2:16:16:7] model performed best, with 74% accuracy, whereas ANN [2:16:25:7] performed best in cross-validation, with 80% accuracy. The best individual outputs were "tacked-together" from the best five ANN models and were also analyzed, achieving accuracy up to 88%. It is suggested that when these seven mix-design influencing factors are involved, then ANN [2:16:25:7] can be used to predict the mix which can be cross-verified with GDX-ANN [7:14:2] to ensure accuracy and, due to the few mix trials required, help design the SHGC with lower costs, less time, and fewer materials.

With emergence of memristors in VLSI technologies the idea of designing scalable analog data storage elements finds its second wind. A memristor, known for its history dependent resistance levels, independently can provide blocks of binary or discrete state data storage. However, using single memristor to save the analog value is practically limited due to the device variability and implementation complexity. In this paper, we present a new design of discrete state memory cell consisting of sub cells constructed from a memristor and its resistive network. A memristor in the sub-cells provides the storage element, while its resistive network is used for programming its resistance. Several sub-cells are then connected in parallel, resembling potential divider configuration. The output of the memory cell is the voltage resulting from distributing the input voltage among the sub-cells. Here, proposed design was programmed to obtain 10 and 27 different output levels depending on the configuration of the combined resistive networks within the sub-cell. Despite the simplicity of the circuit, this realization of multilevel memory provides increased number of output levels compared to previous designs of memory technologies based on memristors. Simulation results of proposed memory are analyzed providing explicit data on the issues of distinguishing discrete analog output levels and sensitivity of the cell to oscillations in write signal patterns.

J	Léchappé, V; Moulay, E; Plestan, F; Han, QL				Lechappe, Vincent; Moulay, Emmanuel; Plestan, Franck; Han, Qing-Long			Discrete predictor-based event-triggered control of networked control systems	AUTOMATICA												A predictor-based controller combined with two event-triggering mechanisms is proposed in order to control an LTI system over a network. The controller is designed in the discrete-time domain which allows to deal with a long sampling period. Similarly large input and output delays can be compensated thanks to the use of a predictor-based method. Two event-triggering mechanisms, in the sensor-to controller and controller-to-actuator channels are introduced in order to limit the number of packets sent over the network while preserving the ultimate boundedness of the solutions. The effect of input and output quantization introduced by the network is considered in the stability analysis. The results are illustrated by simulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Min, S; Jing, L				Min, Sun; Jing, Liu			Noise-tolerant continuous-time Zhang neural networks for time-varying Sylvester tensor equations	ADVANCES IN DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS												In this paper, to solve the time-varying Sylvester tensor equations (TVSTEs) with noise, we will design three noise-tolerant continuous-time Zhang neural networks (NTCTZNNs), termed NTCTZNN1, NTCTZNN2, NTCTZNN3, respectively. The most important characteristic of these neural networks is that they make full use of the time-derivative information of the TVSTEs' coefficients. Theoretical analyses show that no matter how large the unknown noise is, the residual error generated by NTCTZNN2 converges globally to zero. Meanwhile, as long as the design parameter is large enough, the residual errors generated by NTCTZNN1 and NTCTZNN3 can be arbitrarily small. For comparison, the gradient-based neural network (GNN) is also presented and analyzed to solve TVSTEs. Numerical examples and results demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed neural networks.

A water-using network involving regeneration unit can be formed by adding the regenerated stream(s) into the network involving reuse only. In the design procedure of the network operated in a single batch mode, time is taken as the primary factor and concentration potentials as the secondary one. For the networks operated in a repeated mode, the design procedure is similar to that for continuous processes, besides designing the storage tanks with the rules proposed. Continuous regeneration unit is selected in this work. With the proposed method, the network structure corresponding to the minimum freshwater consumption can be obtained. It is shown that the method proposed in this article is simple, effective and has clear engineering meaning.

J	Wang, Y				Wang, Yan			Design of Trustworthy Cyber-Physical-Social Systems With Discrete Bayesian Optimization	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN												Cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) with highly integrated functions of sensing, actuation, computation, and communication are becoming the mainstream consumer and commercial products. The performance of CPSS heavily relies on the information sharing between devices. Given the extensive data collection and sharing, security and privacy are of major concerns. Thus, one major challenge of designing those CPSS is how to incorporate the perception of trust in product and systems design. Recently, a trust quantification method was proposed to measure the trustworthiness of CPSS by quantitative metrics of ability, benevolence, and integrity. The CPSS network architecture can be optimized by choosing a subnet such that the trust metrics are maximized. The combinatorial network optimization problem, however, is computationally challenging. Most of the available global optimization algorithms for solving such problems are heuristic methods. In this paper, a surrogate-based discrete Bayesian optimization method is developed to perform network design, where the most trustworthy CPSS network with respect to a reference node is formed to collaborate and share information with. The applications of ability and benevolence metrics in design optimization of CPSS architecture are demonstrated.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is the examination of sustainability of supply networks and the network performance measurement when bounded, discrete, and joint variables are presented. Accordingly, an estimation approach derived from the DEA is developed in the current paper to performance assessment of sustainable supply networks (SSNs) that incorporate bounded and discrete measures as economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Moreover, the introduced approach is extended to handle situations that there are considered to be the joint factors between dimensions. The suggested approach is employed to a numerical example and the areas of sustainable banking sectors and sustainable soft drink supply networks. The reliability and performance of the proposed approach are investigated by comparison with one of the practical approaches. The findings show the proposed technique leads to creditable consequences and target points. This paper contributes by rendering a nonparametric approach based on non-radial measure to estimate efficiencies of SSNs and targets, whereas there are bounded, discrete, and/or joint attributes and also studying some applications.

Based on the framework of nonsmooth analysis, some discontinuous or continuous controllers are designed to force the coupled networks to synchronize to an isolated neural network. Some sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the FTS by utilizing the well-known finite-time stability theorem for nonlinear systems. Compared with the previous literatures, such synchronization objective will be realized when the activations and the controllers are both discontinuous.

But due to the less flexibility and fixed to locations of railway improvements, strategic redistribution of network-wide demand onto the improving rail lines is required (Okumura and Tsukal 2007). This paper presents an optimal modal-mix planning model in intercity passenger transportation, which aims to design a modal mix network of least CO2 emissions and less total travel time, as well as less intermediate transfer cost, considering feasibility and economical sustainability of the service frequency.

A mathematical model of the mould was used to generate outputs to determine the thermal state of the mould under various operating conditions and judge whether the current operating practice is favourable. The outputs were used to train a set of neural networks to capture the functionality of the mathematical model in the networks. The networks were used to draw two-dimensional maps of mould parameters as a function of operating practice variables. The networks execute the input-output transformation much faster than the original mathematical model and thereby make the construction of these two-dimensional maps practicable. The functionality of the taper design process was also captured in a set of networks.

Although the number of neurons in the input layer is decided by the number of input parameters, and similarly, in the output layer the number of neurons is fixed by the output parameters, however, the number of neurons in the hidden layer is not fixed, whereby the overall efficiency of the ANN depends upon the correct modeling of the realistic scenario in the form of a neural network. Concrete can be mixed in a huge variety of methods and compositions to achieve a specific or a combination of specific results. These results have been observed to repeat and follow patterns. Furthermore, for several types of concrete mixes, only actual physical trial data are available with no mix design method; this makes achieving different required results very complex and expensive task. Having an ANN to be able to predict a concrete mix to handle such variations will save a lot of time and money and will prove to be a universal mix design tool. A thorough analysis for deciding the number of neurons for mix design of concrete has been carried out in this research. The results of neural networks for a varying number of neurons and layers have been correlated. The data for a number of concrete mixes were sorted and normalized. Properties of concrete constituents like specific gravity of cement, coarse and fine aggregates, dry density of coarse and fine aggregates, cement type, type of mineral admixture, water-to-cement ratio, type and temperature of curing and hardened properties like compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and tensile strength were taken as input parameters. The contents of constituents of concrete such as water content, cement content, coarse aggregates content, fine aggregates content and content of mineral admixtures are regarded as output parameters. For 17 inputs and 5 outputs, it has been discovered that simple neural network with single or double hidden layers performed better that 3 or more such layers.

Risk of Stochastic Systems for Temporal Logic Specifications	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS												The wide availability of data coupled with the computational advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning promise to enable many future technologies such as autonomous driving. While there has been a variety of successful demonstrations of these technologies, critical system failures have repeatedly been reported. Even if rare, such system failures pose a serious barrier to adoptionwithout a rigorous risk assessment. This article presents a framework for the systematic and rigorous risk verification of systems. We consider a wide range of system specifications formulated in signal temporal logic (STL) and model the system as a stochastic process, permitting discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic processes. We then define the STL robustness risk as the risk of lacking robustness against failure. This definition is motivated as system failures are often caused by missing robustness to modeling errors, system disturbances, and distribution shifts in the underlying data generating process. Within the definition, we permit general classes of risk measures and focus on tail risk measures such as the value-at-risk and the conditional value-at-risk. While the STL robustness risk is in general hard to compute, we propose the approximate STL robustness risk as a more tractable notion that upper bounds the STL robustness risk. We show how the approximate STL robustness risk can accurately be estimated from system trajectory data. For discrete-time stochastic processes, we show under which conditions the approximate STL robustness risk can even be computed exactly. We illustrate our verification algorithm in the autonomous driving simulator CARLA and show how a least risky controller can be selected among four neural network lane-keeping controllers for five meaningful system specifications.

This structure is composed of regular arrays of synaptic multipliers, neurons and registers. A distributed resistive type neuron architecture is used to take advantage of self-scaling property of the neurons. A distributed architecture allows the chip to be used in different network sizes. Training is done on-chip with MADALINE Rule III. Although MADALINE Rule III is more robust for analog and mixed signal designs with good overall speed during the training phase, there is not many reported works applying this technique. The problems of node addressing and routing are solved by performing the operations in current mode through a summing node. The simulation results for an XOR problem are presented to show the generality of the design.																					0-7803-7781-8				2003							591	594																WOS:000185776300136

On the basis of the drive-response concept and H-infinity control theory, and using Lyapunov-Krasovskii (or Lyapunov) functional, state feedback controllers are established to not only guarantee exponential stable synchronization between two general chaotic neural networks with or without time delays, but also reduce the effect of external disturbance on the synchronization error to a minimal H-infinity norm constraint. The proposed controllers can be obtained by solving the convex optimization problems represented by linear matrix inequalities. Most discrete-time chaotic systems with or without time delays, such as Hopfield neural networks, cellular neural networks, bidirectional associative memory networks, recurrent multilayer perceptrons, Cohen-Grossberg neural networks, Chua's circuits, etc., can be transformed into this general chaotic neural network to be H-infinity synchronization controller designed in a unified way. Finally, some illustrated examples with their simulations have been utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.					zhang, sen/GXH-3513-2022														1045-9227	1941-0093				AUG	2010	21	8					1358	1365		10.1109/TNN.2010.2050904	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2050904								20601309					WOS:000283422600015

The controllers are applied to four plants in simulation on a network control system (NCS), three of the plants are FOPTD plants with different self-regulation indices and one corresponds to a higher order non-minimum phase plant. The tests carried out considered fixed and variable delays in a known range for the communication network. The design of the controllers considers a certain degree of robustness using a strategy based on the Nyquist criterion in discrete time. The results show that GPPI has better performance than PPI and PI for FOPTD plants when their delay is greater than their time constant and for the case of the higher order system. The improvement is attributed to the fact that GPPI combines the prediction characteristics of PPI with the smoother transient characteristics of PI, which implies a better behavior in the presence of delay uncertainty.

A Mixed Integer Programming Approach for Logistic Network Design and Optimization Information and Value Adding Networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH CIRP-SPONSORED INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY	Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing				6th International Conference on Digital Enterprise Technology	DEC 14-16, 2009	Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	CIRP	Univ Hong Kong			As markets, technologies and competitive forces continue to change at ever increasing rates, organisations are becoming more pressing for reform. To compete and survive in these global markets requires a logistic oriented organisation, specifically the need to move goods greater distances quickly and efficiently. Such a radical change entails a regrouping within the organisation so that the key tasks become the management of cross-functional work flows. In this paper, the importance of information sharing has been reviewed and six types of logistic networks have been illustrated. Emphasis has been placed on designing the network on operational considerations such as capacities, geographical locations and core competences as well as market factors and demand. A mixed integer programming method has been used to minimize the logistic network cost and numerical experiments are performed using a brand-and-bound solver from LINDO. The analysis results demonstrate that the proposed mixed integer programming can provide certain combinations of routing rules and locations which result in low logistic costs while maintaining high levels of customer service.																			1867-5662		978-3-642-10429-9				2010	66						1227	+																WOS:000276236600094

J	Boily, MC; Poulin, R; Mâsse, B				Boily, MC; Poulin, R; Mâsse, B			Some methodological issues in the study of sexual networks -: From model to data to model	SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES												Background: Mixing between sexual activity classes is an important determinant of sexually transmitted disease transmission. However. attempts to estimate sexual mixing patterns in the field remain limited partly because of practical and methodological difficulties. Goal: To evaluate and identify appropriate sampling schemes to estimate the mixing pattern between sexual activity classes from large population networks with one or more components. Study Design: The study is based on simulations of large population networks with various structural characteristics. A variety of snowball sampling schemes are applied to these networks and are evaluated by the quality of the mixing matrix estimates that they produce. Results and Conclusions: Unbiased estimation of mixing patterns (global assortativity, within-group mixing of the lowest activity classes, within-group mixing of the highest activity classes) from large population networks is possible with a snowball sampling design in which the initial sample of index cases is drawn from the general population, all partners of the index case are recruited, and only one generation of partners are traced (one cycle). Simulation techniques proved useful in addressing complex methodological issues in situations where analytic results are difficult to obtain.

These quantization effects can be reduced by increasing the number of quantization levels. However, increasing the number of quantization levels may lead to network congestion, (i.e., the network needs to transfer more information than its capacity). In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing a robust H-infinity output feedback controller for discrete-time networked systems with an adaptive quantization density or limited information. More precisely, the quantization density is designed to be a function of the network load condition which is modeled by a Markov process. A stability criterion is developed by using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and sufficient conditions for the existence of a dynamic quantized output feedback controller are given in terms of Bilinear Matrix Inequalities(BMIs). An iterative algorithm is suggested to obtain quasi-convex Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) from BMIs. An example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.

Users have higher quality requirements for electronic devices. Electronic device testing has gradually become an irreplaceable engineering process in modern manufacturing enterprises to guarantee the quality of products while preventing inferior products from entering the market. Considering the large output of electronic devices, improving the testing efficiency while reducing the testing cost has become an urgent problem to be solved. This study investigates the electronic device testing machine allocation problem (EDTMAP), aiming to improve the production of electronic devices and reduce the scheduling distance among testing machines through reasonable machine allocation. First, a mathematical model was formulated for the EDTMAP to maximize both production and the scheduling distance among testing machines. Second, we developed a discrete multi-objective artificial bee colony (DMOABC) algorithm to solve EDTMAP. A crossover operator and local search operator were designed to improve the exploration and exploitation of the algorithm, respectively. Numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2). Finally, the mathematical model and DMOABC algorithm were applied to a real-world factory that tests radio-frequency modules. The results verify that our method can significantly improve production and reduce the scheduling distance among testing machines.

The considered scenario is an access point (AP) equipped with multiple antennas communicates with a multi-antenna enabled legitimate user in the downlink at the present of an eavesdropper configured with multiple antennas. Particularly, the joint optimization of the transmit covariance matrix at the AP and the reflecting coefficients at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate for the IRS-MIMOME system is investigated, with two different assumptions on the phase shifting capabilities at the IRS, i.e., the IRS has the continuous reflecting coefficients and the IRS has the discrete reflecting coefficients. For the former case, due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed, i.e., for given the reflecting coefficients at the IRS, the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is used to solve the transmit covariance matrix optimization, while given the transmit covariance matrix at the AP, alternative optimization is used again in individually optimizing of each reflecting coefficient at the IRS with other fixed reflecting coefficients. For the individual reflecting coefficient optimization, the closed-form or an interval of the optimal solution is provided. Then, the proposed algorithm is extended to the discrete reflecting coefficient model at the IRS. Finally, some numerical simulations have been done to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark schemes.

This study aims to evaluate and predict such clogging behavior of PC using hybrid machine learning techniques. Based on the 84 groups of the dataset developed in the earlier study, the clogging behavior of the PC was determined by the algorithm combing the SVM (support vector machines) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods. The PSO algorithm was employed to adjust the hyperparameters of the SVM and verify the performance using 10-fold cross-validation. The predicting results of the developed model were assessed by the coefficient of determination (R) and root mean square error (RMSE). The importance of the influential variables on the clogging behavior of PC was evaluated as well. The results showed that the PSO algorithm can effectively adjust the hyperparameters of the SVM model and can be used to construct the predictive model for the clogging behavior of the PC. The combined algorithm has the advantage of higher reliability and validity than the random hyperparameters selection. For the verification process, the developed model was able to obtain values of 0.9469 and 1.8148 for the R and RMSE, showing that the developed machine learning model can accurately be used to evaluate and predict the clogging behavior of the PC, guiding the mix-design of PC from the perspective of durability. The size of the clogging sand is the most important parameter and the thickness of the sample is the least significant factor affecting the clogging behavior. The proportions of the smallest aggregate size and largest aggregate size are the two most important design parameters of concrete with the consideration of the relatively higher importance scores, showing these two aggregates should be given special attention in future PC design for anti-clogging purposes.

J	Zhang, JH; Smith, R				Zhang, JH; Smith, R			Design and optimisation of batch and semi-batch reactors	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												This paper addresses a systematic methodology for batch and semi-batch reactor design and optimisation for both ideal and non-ideal mixing. It can be applied to non-isothermal and multiphase systems. The method starts from a general representation in the form of a temporal superstructure based on the similarity of between plug flow reactors and ideal batch reactors. The temporal superstructure of a batch reactor exists in both the space and time dimensions. For non-ideal mixing, this paper addresses a mixing compartment network model to represent mixing inside reactors. The mixing compartment network is then included into the temporal superstructure to model non-ideally mixed batch reactors and the mixing pattern optimised with the other variables. Besides the operation variables for batch reactors, this method can also suggest the optimum mixing pattern and promising reactor configurations for mechanical design. A profile-based approach is proposed to make a search of the profiles for temperature, pressure and feed addition. This approach starts from a set of initial profiles of temperature, pressure and feed addition. Then the performance of the batch reactor is evaluated against the objective function under different profiles. An optimal set of profiles is then found by this profile searching process. A stochastic optimisation technique based on simulated annealing is employed to obtain optimal solutions. This method is also extended to multiphase reaction systems based on the concept of shadow reactor compartments. A number of case studies are presented to illustrate the use of the proposed methodology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To ensure adequate safety of ageing highway bridges under potential earthquake shocks, it is imperative to perform proper maintenances during their service life. This paper aims at optimizing the life-cycle maintenance strategies for highway bridges under the combinatorial threats of progressive deterioration and sudden earthquakes. Driven by the distinct characteristics of the two threats, we have proposed a novel hybrid Markov decision process model that integrates a discrete-time Markov decision process model for dealing with progressive deterioration and a continuous-time Markov decision process model for dealing with sudden earthquakes into a unified framework. The proposed model is further reduced into the form of a discrete-time Markov decision process model with an equivalent state transition matrix and an equivalent discount factor, which can be easily solved by dynamic programming. A ternary state space that collectively describes corrosion initiation, corrosion damage cumulation, and seismic damage cumulation is defined. A gamma process and a Poisson process are adopted to model bridge corrosion and earthquake occurrences, respectively. To demonstrate the application of the proposed framework, a numerical example is conducted, in which the optimizations with respect to the maintenance strategy, inspection interval, and design performance level of a hypothetical highway bridge are carried out successively.

J	Zhang, XY				Zhang, Xiaoyu			Discrete Adaptive Sliding Mode Control via Wavelet Network for a Class of Nonlinear Systems	APPLIED MATHEMATICS & INFORMATION SCIENCES												Unmodelled dynamics and perturbations are always immeasurable. In this paper, an adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) based on wavelet network (WN) for a class of non-affine multi-variable nonlinear discrete systems is presented in order to compensate them. Wavelet network which parameters are tuned on-line is adopted to realize the equivalent control, and hitting controls are added in order to satisfy reaching conditions. By combining the adaptive WN with SMC strategy, the constructed control law has many advantages such as robustness, adaptive characters, and the precise mathematic models of controlled plants are not required. Finally, experiment on an inverted pendulum control system based on the proposed control design method is given to verify its effectiveness and performance.

However, empirical studies show that choice is social - influenced by many factors beyond engineering performance of a product and consumer attributes. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a new choice modeling framework to capture the dynamic influence from social networks on consumer adoption of new products. By introducing social influence attributes into a choice utility function, social network simulation is integrated with the traditional discrete choice analysis in a three-stage process. Our study shows the need for considering social impact in forecasting new product adoption. Using hybrid electric vehicles as an example, our work illustrates the procedure of social network construction, social influence evaluation, and choice model estimation based on data from the National Household Travel Survey. Our study also demonstrates several interesting findings on the dynamic nature of new technology adoption and how social networks may influence hybrid electric vehicle adoption.

Classifying remotely sensed data into a thematic map remains a challenge because many factors, such as the complexity of the landscape in a study area, selected remotely sensed data, and image-processing and classification approaches, may affect the success of a classification. Up-to-date and accurate classification results are required for analyses, which provide basis for deciding and implementing policies and plans for management of agricultural crops in local, regional and global scale. Successful identification of crops requires knowledge of the developmental stages and appearance of each crop in the area to be inventoried. The crops thus identified from the remote sensing data can be utilized to estimate crop water requirements for irrigation planning and management. Supervised and unsupervised classifications have been in common use in remote sensing for many years which are known as hard classification. Supervised and unsupervised classifications rely on classical set theory in assigning pixels into discrete classes based on training sets and some statistically determined criteria. Conventional classification methods such as Supervised and Unsupervised classification techniques are often incapable of performing satisfactorily in the presence of mixed pixels, the pixels which are not completely occupied by a single homogeneous category. Soft computing techniques are useful for tackling these real-world problems based on fuzzy systems, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary algorithms. These techniques are widely used nowadays by researchers. Nevertheless, each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. Contrary to hard classifiers, fuzzy classifier does not make a definitive decision about the land cover class to which each pixel belongs. Rather, they develop statements of the degree to which each pixel belongs to each of the land cover classes being considered. It is achieved by applying a function called "membership function" on remotely sensed images. Artificial Neural Networks are computer programs that are designed to simulate human-learning processes through establishment and reinforcement of linkages between input data and output data. Artificial neural network is used as a powerful tool for pattern classification and have been found to be accurate in the classification of remotely sensed data. The paper reviews application of different soft computing classification techniques for crop mapping which is necessary for estimating crop water requirements with the help of satellite images.

J	Chang, WD				Chang, Wei-Der			Identification of nonlinear discrete systems using a new Hammerstein model with Volterra neural network	SOFT COMPUTING												For identifying nonlinear discrete systems, a new Hammerstein model consisting of Volterra neural network (VNN) and infinite impulse response (IIR) digital system is developed in this paper. The nonlinear static part of Hammerstein model is the proposed VNN structure that is a combination of the Volterra digital system and feedforward neural network. Another linear dynamic part in the model is expressed by the IIR digital filter. To design weights and thresholds contained in VNN and filter coefficients in IIR, a popular particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted such that the model output is able to approximate the actual nonlinear system output. Finally, many examinations including different population sizes and initial conditions are performed for two nonlinear system examples. All of simulation data including the mean squared error and sum of squared error derived by the proposed method are superior to those by other existing design methods. These sufficiently show the excellent performance of the developed Hammerstein model with PSO tuning on the nonlinear discrete systems modeling.																			1432-7643	1433-7479				JUL	2022	26	14					6765	6775		10.1007/s00500-022-07089-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-022-07089-6		APR 2022											WOS:000782879300002

Specifically, the UFMC signals are generated with DolphChebyshev, Hamming and Hanning filtering. The characteristics of UFMC signals are also compared with OFDM signal, in both software and hardware-in-the-Ioop simulations. Experimental results show that LJFMC signals have better performance than OFDM signal, by means of side-lobe attenuation, bit-error-ratio (BER) and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The results indicate that the LJFMC signal is more suitable than OFDM signal for discrete narrow-band private networks. The results can provide useful information on the design of multi-carrier radio systems.																					978-1-4673-7441-5				2015							303	307																WOS:000398702000066

These quantization effects can be reduced by increasing the number of quantization levels. However, increasing the number of quantization levels may lead to network congestion, (i.e., the network needs to transfer more information). In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing a robust H-infinity output feedback controller for discrete-time networked systems with an adaptive quantization density or limited information. More precisely, the quantization density is designed to be a function of the network load condition which is modeled by a Markov process. A stability criterion is developed by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and sufficient conditions for the existence of a dynamic quantized output feedback controller are given in terms of Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs). An iterative algorithm is suggested to obtain quasi-convex Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) from BMIs. An example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.

The main purpose is to establish an adaptive actor-critic control method, so that the cost function in the procedure of dealing with uncertainty is minimum and the closed-loop system is stable. Based on the neural network approximator, an action network is applied to generate the optimal control signal and a critic network is used to approximate the cost function, respectively. In contrast to the previous methods, the main features of this paper are: 1) the ACD scheme is integrated into the controllers to cope with the uncertainty and 2) a novel cost function, which is not in quadric form, is proposed so that the total cost in the design procedure is reduced. It is proved that the optimal control signals and the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded even when the uncertainty exists. Finally, a numerical simulation is developed to show the effectiveness of the present approach.					yang, yue/KCK-7870-2024; Li, Zilong/JEZ-8642-2023	Liu, Lei/0000-0003-3724-0596; Han, Jian/0000-0002-0647-4050													2162-237X	2162-2388				APR	2018	29	4					1239	1251		10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2660070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2660070								28362616					WOS:000427859600038

Given an unstable complex networks (the ith subsystem is x(i)(t) = A(i)x(i)(t) + & sum;(N)(j=1)a(ij) Ix(j)(t) ), we will design a discrete time feedback control B(i)e(i)([t] tau) to stabilize tau it. These discrete times are 0, tau, 2 tau, ... , where tau > 0 is the duration between two consecutive observations. When tau is sufficiently small, these discrete times are all over [0, infinity). Thus we design an auxiliary system which is exponentially stable (the ith subsystem is e(i)(t) = A(i)e(i)(t) + B(i)e(i)(t) + & sum;(j=1)a(ij)ej(t)), and hope to find a range of tau by the error of two feedback control systems. By constructing Lyapunov functions and using a graph-theoretic technique, we obtain a synchronization criterion. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Time-dependent transportation network design that considers health cost	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE												This paper proposes a bi-level optimisation framework for time-dependent discrete road network design that considers health impacts. A general health cost function is proposed and captured in the framework. The function simultaneously considers the health impacts of road traffic emissions, noise, and accidents due to network expansion. To solve the problem, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed to search the network design solutions of the upper-level problem, while the method of successive averages and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm are adopted to solve the lower-level time-dependent land-use transportation problem. A repairing procedure is proposed to remedy infeasible solutions. A numerical study is set up to illustrate the conflict between maximising consumer surplus and minimising the health cost. This paper also reveals a paradox phenomenon that with an increasing amount of emissions, the health cost decreases. Moreover, the existence of a health inequity between different residential zones is demonstrated. A modified Sioux Falls network is adopted to show the performance of the solution algorithm as well as the effectiveness of the proposed repairing procedure.

Design of current turboshaft engine control systems are based on cascade control system framework. Next generation aircraft engine control systems are based on distributed architecture, in which, communication constraints like time delays can degrade control system performance. Stability of networked cascade control systems for turboshaft engines in a state space framework is analyzed in the presence of time delays.

Gas turbine blades are the key parts of the gas turbine. Their manufacturing accuracy directly affects the fuel economy of the gas turbine. Thus, how to improve the manufacturing accuracy of gas turbine blades has always been a hot research topic. In this study, we perform a quantitative study on the correlation between process parameters and the overall wax pattern shrinkage of gas turbine blades in the wax injection process. A prediction model based on a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) is developed with the newly defined cross-sectional features consisting of area, area ratio, and some discrete point deviations. In the qualitative analysis of the cross-sectional features, it is concluded that the highest accuracy of the wax pattern is obtained for the fourth group of experiments, which corresponds to a holding pressure of 18 bars, a holding time of 180 s, and an injection temperature of 62 C-?. The prediction model is trained and tested based on small experimental data, resulting in an average RE of 1.5% for the area, an average RE of 0.58% for the area ratio, and a maximum MSE of less than 0.06 mm(2) for discrete point deviations. Experiments show that the GRNN prediction model constructed in this study is relatively accurate, which means that the shrinkage of the remaining major investment casting procedures can also be modeled and controlled separately to obtain turbine blades with higher accuracy.

Here, polypropylene (PP)/aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanocomposites with a continuous segregated structure were designed. Al2O3 nanoparticles were initially distributed in the polyolefin elastomer (POE) phase of PP/POE/Al2O3 with a co-continuous structure. Selective extraction of the POE phase provided a porous PP scaffold, whose pore walls were covered by deposited Al2O3 nanoparticles. Subsequent compression molding made the porous scaffold tightly compacted to form uniform and dense theimal conductive networks. The thermal conductivity was compared among nanocomposites having three different types of Al2O3 distribution. It was found that the continuous segregated distribution was far the most effective for improving the thermal conductivity, where 1.07 W/m K was achieved at an Al2O3 loading of 27.5 vol%.

In addition to forwarding packets, routers mix (i.e., code) packets from different sources to increase the information content of each transmission. We show that intelligently mixing packets increases network throughput. Our design is rooted in the theory of network coding. Prior work on network coding is mainly theoretical and focuses on multicast traffic. This paper aims to bridge theory with practice; it addresses the common case of unicast traffic, dynamic and potentially bursty flows, and practical issues facing the integration of network coding in the current network stack. We evaluate our design on a 20-node wireless network, and discuss the results of the first testbed deployment of wireless network coding. The results show that using COPE at the forwarding layer, without modifying routing and higher layers, increases network throughput. The gains vary from a few percent to several folds depending on the traffic pattern, congestion level, and transport protocol.

Discrete-Time Switched Linear Systems State Feedback Design With Application to Networked Control	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												This technical note addresses the state feedback switched control design problem for discrete-time switched linear systems. More specifically, the control goal is to jointly design a set of state feedback gains and a state dependent switching function, ensuring H-2 and H-infinity guaranteed performance. The conditions are based on Lyapunov or Riccati-Metzler inequalities, which allow the derivation of simpler alternative conditions that are expressed as LMIs whenever a scalar variable is fixed. The theoretical results are well adapted to deal with the self-triggered control design problem, where the switching rule is responsible for the scheduling of multiple sampling periods, to be considered in the communication channel in order to improve performance. This method is compared to others from the literature. Examples show the validity of the proposed technique in both contexts, switched and networked control systems.

In the proposed method, the control law is only updated when the event-triggered condition is violated. Compared with the periodic updates in the traditional adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) control, the proposed method can reduce the computation and transmission cost. An actor-critic framework is used to learn the optimal event-triggered control law and the value function. Furthermore, a model network is designed to estimate the system state vector. The main contribution of this paper is to design a new trigger threshold for discrete-time systems. A detailed Lyapunov stability analysis shows that our proposed event-triggered controller can asymptotically stabilize the discrete-time systems. Finally, we test our method on two different discrete-time systems, and the simulation results are included.

Polymer architecture dictates multiple relaxation processes in soft networks with two orthogonal dynamic bonds	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Materials with tunable modulus, viscosity, and complex viscoelastic spectra are crucial in applications such as self-healing, additive manufacturing, and energy damping. It is still challenging to predictively design polymer networks with hierarchical relaxation processes, as many competing factors affect dynamics. Here, networks with both pendant and telechelic architecture are synthesized with mixed orthogonal dynamic bonds to understand how the network connectivity and bond exchange mechanisms govern the overall relaxation spectrum. A hydrogen-bonding group and a vitrimeric dynamic crosslinker are combined into the same network, and multimodal relaxation is observed in both pendant and telechelic networks. This is in stark contrast to similar networks where two dynamic bonds share the same exchange mechanism. With the incorporation of orthogonal dynamic bonds, the mixed network also demonstrates excellent damping and improved mechanical properties. In addition, two relaxation processes arise when only hydrogen-bond exchange is present, and both modes are retained in the mixed dynamic networks. This work provides molecular insights for the predictive design of hierarchical dynamics in soft materials. Materials with tunable modulus, viscosity, and complex viscoelastic spectra are crucial in various applications but it remains challenging to design polymer networks with predicted hierarchical relaxation processes.

Thus, the development of thermally-stable polymeric membranes with efficient permselectivity is crucial. In this work, we designed a composite membrane consisting of a homogeneously distributed ionic liquid (IL) in a PDMS network using a physical blending approach. Benefiting from the strong physical-crosslinking interaction between PDMS and the IL, the polymer chain mobility is inhibited, and the structural stability of the composite membrane is improved thus maintaining excellent gas separation performance at elevated temperatures from 25 degrees C to 150 degrees C. The obtained composite membranes display a superior CO2 permeance of 22.6 GPU and a high CO2/N-2 selectivity of 21.4 at 150 degrees C. More significantly, the separation performance of the composite membrane can return back to the initial value when the temperature drops to room temperature. Additionally, the composite membrane retains its good CO2/N-2 separation performance during an 80 h continuous operation at 150 degrees C, further indicating the high thermal stability of the composite membrane. The polymer/IL blend system described here is very promising for the removal of CO2 from high-temperature flue gas.																			1144-0546	1369-9261				JAN 24	2022	46	4					1808	1814		10.1039/d1nj04493a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1nj04493a		DEC 2021											WOS:000738881400001

J	Wang, J; Deng, W				Wang, Jian; Deng, Wei			OPTIMIZING CAPACITY OF SIGNALIZED ROAD NETWORK WITH REVERSIBLE LANES	TRANSPORT												This paper studies the network capacity problem on signalized road network with reversible lanes. A Mixed Network Design Problem (MDNP) is formulated to describe the problem where the upper-level problem is a mixed integer non-linear program designed to maximize the network capacity by optimizing the input parameters (e.g. the signal splits, circles, reassigned number of lanes and O-D demands), while the lower-level problem is the common Deterministic User Equilibrium (DUE) assignment problem formulated to model the drivers' route choices. According to whether one way strategy is permitted in practice, two strategies for implementing reversible roadway are considered. In the first strategy, not all lanes are reversible and the reversible roadways always hold its ability to accommodate the two-way traffic flow. In the second strategy, one-way road is allowed, which means that all the lanes are reversible and could be assigned to one flow direction if the traffic flow in both directions is severally unsymmetrical. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is detailedly presented to solve the bi-level network capacity problem. The application of the proposed method on a numerical example denotes that Strategy 2 can make more use of the physical capacity of key links (signal controlled links), thus, the corresponding network capacity outperforms it is of Strategy 1 considerably.

J	Meneguzzer, C				Meneguzzer, Claudio			Day-to-day dynamics in a simple traffic network with mixed direct and contrarian route choice behaviors	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												Contrarian behavior is an attitude leading individuals to act "contrary to the crowd'' and can be observed in a variety of collective systems. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of such behavioral trait on the day-to-day evolution of a traffic system in a simple two-route scenario. To this end, we formulate a nonlinear, discrete-time dynamical system and analyze how the fraction of contrarian-like choices affects fixed point uniqueness and stability, as well as mean travel cost evaluated both for the network as a whole and separately for subjects adopting either type of route choice behavior. We show that uniqueness and stability of the fixed point of the dynamical system are ensured inside certain ranges of the fraction of contrarian subjects within the traveling population, and that the width of such ranges depends on the sensitivity of actual costs to flows and on the level of accuracy of individuals' cost perception. Moreover, instability is seen to take different forms (oscillatory behavior or convergence to alternate fixed points) depending on which limit of the stability region is crossed by the fraction of contrarians. Results of the analysis also indicate that introducing memory and learning in the process of expected cost formation tends to counter the destabilizing effect of strongly flow-dependent costs and highly cost-sensitive route choices. Finally, direct and contrarian travelers attain the same mean travel cost throughout the fixed point stability region, while a competitive advantage of the minority group emerges outside such region, albeit at the price of a deteriorated global network performance. Overall, the findings of the study support the conclusion that a well-balanced diversification of the traveling population in terms of direct and contrarian route choice attitudes has the potential to protect the system against instabilities induced by other behavioral and network features, and that this beneficial effect can be amplified by the occurrence of learning in the formation of perceived travel costs. It is suggested that contrarian behavior may contribute to mitigating the adverse effects of concentration of choices on the "best'' routes and overreaction to the supplied information, induced by Advanced Traveler Information Systems, and thus should be explicitly considered in the design of traffic management strategies involving the deployment of such systems.

Local assortativeness in scale-free networks	EPL												The level of assortative mixing of nodes in real-world networks gives important insights about the networks design and functionality, and has been analyzed in detail. However, this network-level measure conveys insufficient information about the local-level structure and motifs present in networks. We introduce a measure of local assortativeness that quantifies the level of assortative mixing for individual nodes in the context of the overall network. We show that such a measure, together with the resultant local assortativeness distributions for the network, is useful in analyzing network's robustness against targeted attacks. We also study local assortativeness in real-world networks, identifying different phases of network growth, showing that biological and social networks display markedly different local assortativeness distributions to technological networks, and discussing the implications to network design.

Physicochemical characterization revealed that the mixed ZZFO nanospheres with numerous mesopores and a yolk-shell hollow structure were coated uniformly with an ultrathin N-doped carbon shell of similar to 10 nm in thickness and were endowed with an internal continuous carbon network. Benefitting from the striking synergy and interplay of intrinsic component effects and structural advantages, the as-fabricated core-shell ZZFO@C exhibited a superior electrochemical Li-storage performance with a high specific capacity, excellent cycling properties and good rate capability when evaluated as an anode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs). These findings further revealed that the resulting core-shell ZZFO@C would be a promising anode for high-performance LIBs. Furthermore, in-depth insights into the structure/component-Li-storage correlation of the core-shell ZZFO@C hybrid showed that it was significantly favored for optimizational design and efficient fabrication of advanced hybrid anodes for next-generation LIBs in the future.

The iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm via globalized dual heuristic programming (GDHP) technique is developed to design the optimal controller with convergence proof. Three neural networks are used to facilitate the implementation of the iterative algorithm, which will approximate at each iteration the cost function, the optimal control law, and the controlled nonlinear discrete-time system, respectively. A simulation study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present approach in dealing with the nonlinear constrained optimal control problem.

J	Codecasa, D; Stella, F				Codecasa, Daniele; Stella, Fabio			Learning continuous time Bayesian network classifiers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING												Streaming data are relevant to finance, computer science, and engineering while they are becoming increasingly important to medicine and biology. Continuous time Bayesian network classifiers are designed for analyzing multivariate streaming data when time duration of event matters. Structural and parametric learning for the class of continuous time Bayesian network classifiers are considered in the case where complete data is available. Conditional log-likelihood scoring is developed for structural learning on continuous time Bayesian network classifiers. Performance of continuous time Bayesian network classifiers learned when combining conditional log-likelihood scoring and Bayesian parameter estimation are compared with that achieved by continuous time Bayesian network classifiers when learning is based on marginal log-likelihood scoring and to that achieved by dynamic Bayesian network classifiers. Classifiers are compared in terms of accuracy and computation time. Comparison is based on numerical experiments where synthetic and real data are used. Results show that conditional log-likelihood scoring combined with Bayesian parameter estimation outperforms marginal log-likelihood scoring. Conditional log-likelihood scoring becomes even more effective when the amount of available data is limited. Continuous time Bayesian network classifiers outperform in terms of computation time and accuracy dynamic Bayesian network on synthetic and real data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The leakage of private location data in the LBS context has drawn significant attention from academics and industry due to its importance, leading to numerous research efforts aiming to confront the related challenges. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of relevant studies have performed a qualitative and quantitative comparison and analysis of the complex topic of designing countermeasures and discussed the viability of their use with different kinds of services and the potential elements that could be deployed to meet new challenges. Accordingly, the purpose of this survey is to examine the privacy-preserving techniques in LBSs. We categorize and provide an inside-out review of the existing techniques. Performing a retrospective analysis of several typical studies in each category, we summarize their basic principles and recent advances. Additionally, we highlight the use of privacy-preserving techniques in LBSs for enabling new research opportunities. Providing an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of existing studies, this survey may further stimulate new research efforts into this promising field.					, zhxiao@hnu.edu.cn/AFT-5052-2022; Li, Jie/KMX-9455-2024	Li, Jie/0000-0001-7896-5388; Xiao, Zhu/0000-0001-5645-160X													0360-0300	1557-7341				APR	2021	54	1							4	10.1145/3423165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3423165													WOS:000644443200004

However, the balance of membrane flux and catalytic performance represents enormous challenges. Herin, we propose the coagulation-flocculation strategy for piloting the Zeta potential on CMR with the flow-reaction channel by modulating the filler within the mixed matrix membrane. Comprehensive characterizations demonstrate that the modulation of zeta potential in the CMR triggers the regulation of channel environment (interconnected macro-pore network structure) with the formation of more catalytic sites. Both the experimental outcomes and reaction mechanism explicitly validate the facilitating role of channel environment in boosting the enrichment of reactants and selectivity for reactants, thereby substantially stimulating the reactants activation for the subsequent catalytic procedure more feasibly. The CMR presents superior performance in the catalytic discoloration of contaminations (the flux record-value of 8664 L m- 2 h-1, catalytic efficiency: 98.5 %, and robust stability: 15 cycles in Methylene Blue (MB) tests, and brilliant selectivity for various reactants with charge selectivity and size selectivity). This controllable adjustment of the membrane structure based on the coagulation-flocculation mechanism shines tactic for design high-flux, high-efficiency CMR for industrial preparation.						/0009-0001-6279-5369													0376-7388	1873-3123				JAN 15	2024	690								122244	10.1016/j.memsci.2023.122244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2023.122244		NOV 2023											WOS:001110164300001

Many researchers have been carried out to construct nano-architectures using complementary hydrogen bonding of DNAs. However, in order to achieve rational and robust design of various functional nano-architectures using DNAs, it is extremely important to establish basic principles of assembly patterns Of oligo-DNAs based on their complementarity. In this study, to obtain basic information of polyassembly for simple oligo-DNA systems, formation of multiple assemblies of complementary half-sliding oligo-DNAs (cHSOs) was investigated with varying the length and sequence (GC content). A pairs of cHSOs were mixed in combination of complementary each other, and then the formation of high-molecular-weight polyassembly was evaluated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Moreover, the morphology and shape of the polyassembly was investigated by atomic force microscope (AFM) observation on mica. The obtained polyassembly displayed linear and networked morphology, and the continuous length and patterns of the assembly was depend on the length, GC contents and the concentration of the cHSOs.																			1533-4880					JAN	2009	9	1					313	317		10.1166/jnn.2009.J028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2009.J028								19441313					WOS:000263073800040

While TCP has not been designed to handle real-time or multimedia streams, the ubiquitous security devices and administrative restrictions force to use it also in such cases. Usually, it is expected to transfer data as fast as possible. In many classes of applications, however, the streams can be blocked by the network, as well as by the receiver application. Then, a large buffer at the receiver side, or expensive preferences in the network administration, need to be implemented to avert the deterioration of user experience. Instead, the recently developed multi-path variant of TCP (MPTCP) can be applied. Nevertheless, the algorithms managing MPTCP transmission have not been developed to govern the application-restricted streams. In the paper, a discrete sliding-mode paradigm has been chosen for the design of a data flow controller. It deals with simultaneous transmission of data via paths with diverse parameters, e.g., different throughput and delays. The algorithm establishes a feasible (non-negative and bounded) input signal. Executed desirably at the sender side, it prevents both exhausting and overflowing the receiver buffer despite uncertain networking conditions. The properties of the designed control system are analyzed formally and illustrated by numerical tests.

The TVRP-ESN can quickly obtain the PID controller parameters to meet the control performance of the system. According to the network learning and approximation ability of TVRP-ESN, the output weights and the reservoir parameters of TVRP-ESN can be synchronously updated, and then the TVRP-ESN can improve the convergence speed of determining the PID controller parameters. In order to update the output weights and the reservoir parameters of TVRP-ESN, the partial derivative of the system output error is used.

The unit is composed of square-based spouted beds, placed in series and at descending heights, and communicating with each other through an opening in the lateral wall. The gas is fed evenly in parallel. The experimental analysis is based on tracer experiments in cold-flow units, assessing the influence of the number of units and the bed height. The tests proved the good mixing properties of the spouted beds, which create a stable fluidization regime and do not feature dead zones. Each spouted bed can generally be well assimilated to an ideal continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The RTD of the device seems adequate for the application, and also seems to be well tuneable through the selection of the bed height and number of units. Given the good similarity with ideal reactor networks, these represent a valid tool to estimate the final behavior in terms of RTD.

Philip			Adaptive NN Controller Design for a Class of Nonlinear MIMO Discrete-Time Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												An adaptive neural network tracking control is studied for a class of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. The studied systems are in discrete-time form and the discretized dead-zone inputs are considered. In addition, the studied MIMO systems are composed of N subsystems, and each subsystem contains unknown functions and external disturbance. Due to the complicated framework of the discrete-time systems, the existence of the dead zone and the noncausal problem in discrete-time, it brings about difficulties for controlling such a class of systems. To overcome the noncausal problem, by defining the coordinate transformations, the studied systems are transformed into a special form, which is suitable for the backstepping design. The radial basis functions NNs are utilized to approximate the unknown functions of the systems. The adaptation laws and the controllers are designed based on the transformed systems. By using the Lyapunov method, it is proved that the closed-loop system is stable in the sense that the semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded of all the signals and the tracking errors converge to a bounded compact set. The simulation examples and the comparisons with previous approaches are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.					刘, 严君/GZL-5764-2022; Liu, Yan-Jun/H-6371-2011; Chen, C.

In this study, a testbed on the Nanchang-Jiujiang Intelligent Highway in Jiangxi, China is illustrated as an example, and the basic architecture and key technologies is introduced for a proactive traffic safety utilisation, where the core basic safety message (BSM) data are sorted and implemented to perceive and predict risky driving behaviours in a field environment. On this basis, an accurate insight into time-critical driving safety issues can be achieved by investigating raw BSM data, such as the inter-vehicle distance, driver manipulation, vehicle speed, and acceleration/deceleration. Furthermore, to effectively take advantage of connected vehicle information and perceive the high uncertainty of driving behaviours during an emergency situation and evaluate the driving safety in mixed traffic scenarios, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based deep learning framework is introduced to build a multi-horizon vehicle crash risk prediction model using continuous BSMs as the inputs. The experimental results demonstrate the significance of connected vehicle data and deep learning algorithms for improving driving safety and promoting widespread deployment and application of connected vehicles.

However, such a service can also raise a big security concern. For example, two strangers become friends in the online social network and they want to communicate securely. The messages transmitted between them could be encrypted using their public keys and decrypted using their private keys. However, one can not determine whether this public key indeed belongs to the claimed user. In this paper, we design a system to authenticate two strangers in fast mixing online social networks.

J	Perdana, RHY; Nguyen, TV; An, B				Perdana, Ridho Hendra Yoga; Nguyen, Toan-Van; An, Beongku			Adaptive User Pairing in Multi-IRS-Aided Massive MIMO-NOMA Networks: Spectral Efficiency Maximization and Deep Learning Design	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS												In this paper, we propose an adaptive user pairing (AUP) scheme in multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. In the AUP scheme, two users with different channel conditions are selected for user pairing while multiple IRSs assist to improve received signal quality at users. We consider the problem of jointly optimizing the precoding matrix, the phase shift of IRSs, and the user pairing element to maximize the overall spectral efficiency (SE) subject to the maximum power budget at the base station (BS) and user-specific quality-of-service (QoS). The SE problem formulated as the maximization of non-concave functions involves a mixed-integer program, which is very challenging to solve optimally. To tackle this problem, we first relax the user pairing elements to be continuous and then transform the formulated problem into an equivalent non-convex problem with a more tractable form. We then apply the iterative algorithm (IA) with low complexity to guarantee convergence at a relative optimum. Towards real-time optimization, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework to predict the optimal solution of the precoding matrix, the phase shift of IRSs, and user pairing elements according to the user's locations and channel gains. Compared to the conventional optimization method, the DL-based optimization framework can achieve the optimal solution within a very short time via an efficient inference process. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm improves the SE over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the effects of essential parameters such as the total BS transmit power, the number of UEs, IRSs, and BS's antennas on the system are discussed and evaluated to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in balancing resource utilization.

The discrete event simulation model (simgen) is a generic and scalable model that is commonly used to deal with optimization problems in production planning and control, such as manufacturing resource planning. The preparatory steps of discrete event simulations for production planning and control are data preprocessing, parameterization, and experimental design. Given the complexity of the manufacturing environment, discrete event simulation models must incorporate appropriate model details for parameterization and a practical approach to experimental design to ensure efficient execution of simulation models in a reasonable time. The parameterization for discrete event simulation is not trivial; it requires optimizing parameter settings for different materials dependent on routing, bill of materials complexity, and other production process-related features. For a suitable parameterization that completes the execution of discrete event simulation in an expected time, we must reduce variant diversity to an optimized level that removes redundant materials and reflects the validity of the overall production scenario. We employ a network based approach by constructing a bipartite graph and Jaccard-index measure with an overlap threshold to group similar materials using routing features and identify representative materials and manufacturing subnetworks, thus reducing the complexity of products and manufacturing routes.

This investigation presents a net revenue maximizing model that can assist network designers in the design and configuration of a cellular system. The integer programming model takes as given a set of candidate cell locations with corresponding costs, the amount of available bandwidth, the maximum demand for service in each geographical area, and the revenue potential in each customer area. Based on these data, the model determines the size and location of cells, and the specific channels to be allocated to each cell. To solve problem instances, a maximal clique cut procedure is developed in order to efficiently generate tight upper bounds. A lower bound is constructed by solving the discrete optimization model with some of the discrete variables fixed.

In this work, we investigate the effect of the mixing matrix on the modes (poles) of the FDN with the goal of using this information to better design the various FDN parameters. We find the modal decomposition of delay network reverberators using a state space formulation, showing how modes of the system can be extracted by eigenvalue decomposition of the state transition matrix. These modes, and subsequently the FDN parameters, can be designed to mimic the modes in an actual room. We introduce a parameterized orthonormal mixing matrix which can be continuously varied from identity to Hadamard. We also study how continuously varying diffusion in the mixing matrix affects the damping and frequency of these modes. We observe that modes approach each other in damping and then deflect in frequency as the mixing matrix changes from identity to Hadamard. We also quantify the perceptual effect of increasing mixing by calculating the normalized echo density (NED) of the FDN impulse responses over time.

It is aimed for digital communications through the domiciliary power lines as needed by a networked electrical power management and measuring system wherein the circuit must be embedded. For the desired baud rate the bit carriers frequencies of 111 KHz (logical 0) and 125KHz (logical 1) were found optimal. The receiver amplifies and demodulates the incoming bit stream following a frequency-domain discrimination strategy based on switched capacitor (SC) filtering. The transmitter, pure digital, generates the carriers tones and builds the outgoing bit stream based on a frequency division technique by means of digital counters driven by a 6 MHz master clock. This can be either externally or internally generated and, as a byproduct, it is also used to handle the switches of the SC filters in the receiver. The circuit was fabricated in a standard 1.6um CMOS technology. For a +/- 2.5V rail-to-rail power supply the die area results in 5.76 mm2 whereas the current consumption is kept below 12mA. The modem was successfully tested within its own working environment. Main advantages with respect to its previously implemented discrete version by the OEM[1] reside in the extremely reduced number of external components required and the needlessness of a-posteriori filter tuning.																					978-1-59593-816-9				2007							117	122																WOS:000268635500020

Harmonic Performance of Mixer-First Receivers With Circulant-Symmetric Basebands	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS												In this paper, we analyze a mixer-first receiver, which includes passive polyphase mixers, low-noise baseband amplifiers, and baseband circulant-symmetric polyphase feedback. This analysis is performed for input frequencies located around any harmonic frequency of the local oscillator. From this, circuits and methods are introduced, which allow control of the receiver's harmonic input impedance through the use of resistive-capacitive (RC) baseband feedback networks. We show that the harmonic input admittance of the mixer-first receiver is related to the discrete Fourier transform of the baseband circulant. This Fourier relationship allows control of the harmonic impedance response across frequencies. The noise figure of the receiver with circulant-symmetric feedback can approach that of an equivalent mixer-first receiver having harmonic feedforward cancelation without the additional power consumption of a cancelation stage. Harmonic impedance shaping can improve the blocker tolerance by decreasing the harmonic conversion gain. A single design can be reconfigured to use these techniques for fundamental-frequency or subharmonic operation. Derivations for impedance, conversion gain, and noise figure are included and a linear time-invariant circuit model is introduced. These are validated through circuit simulation using a combination of 45-nm silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology and behavioral baseband models.

Each supplier that consists of multiple production lines can produce several types of semi-finished products, and the manufacturing plant produces the finished products using the semi-finished products from the suppliers to meet dynamic demands. In the suppliers, different types of semi-finished products can be produced in the same batch, and products in the same batch can only be started simultaneously (at the same time) even if they complete at different times. The purpose of this study is to determine the selection of suppliers and their production lines for the production of semi-finished products for each period of a given planning horizon, and the objective is to minimize total costs associated with the supply chain during the whole planning horizon. To solve this problem, we suggest a mixed integer programming model and a heuristic algorithm. To verify performance of the algorithm, a series of tests are conducted on a number of instances, and the results are presented.</p>					Lee, Ju-Yong/ABD-8556-2020	Lee, Ju-Yong/0000-0003-4515-1454; Han, Jun-hee/0000-0003-3292-5705														2076-3417				OCT	2021	11	20							9687	10.3390/app11209687	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11209687													WOS:000713634400001

A queuing location-allocation model for a capacitated health care system	SCIENTIA IRANICA												The aim of the present paper is to propose a location-allocation model for a capacitated health care system. This paper develops a discrete modeling framework to determine the optimal number of facilities among candidates and optimal allocations of the existing customers to operating health centers in a coverage distance. In doing so, the total sum of customer and operating facility costs is minimized. Our goal is to create a model that is more practical in the real world. Therefore, setup costs of hospitals are based on the costs of customers, fixed costs of establishing health centers, and costs based on the available resources in each level of hospitals. In this paper, the idea of hierarchical structure has been used. There are two levels of service in hospitals, including low and high levels, and sections at different levels that provide different types of services. The patients refer to different sections of the hospital according to their requirements. To solve the model, two meta-heuristic algorithms, including genetic and simulated annealing algorithms and their combination, are proposed. To evaluate the performance of the three algorithms, some numerical examples are produced and analyzed using the statistical test in order to determine which algorithm works better.

Note that there are position constraints by using the geometric extension method. A novel iterative barrier function is designed for path following. To avoid the complex calculation of arc-lengths in formation along orbits, a so-called circular diffeomorphism is used to map each superellipse to a circle, and then the linear function of chord is used to describe the formation. Adaptive neural networks along the horizontal and longitudinal directions are designed to achieve path following and formation with unknown flowfields, respectively. A uniformly ultimately bounded result is given under directed leader-following topologies. Simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

IMA approach allows mixed criticality real-time applications to be merged into integrated system. These integrated real-time applications must meet their own timing requirements and be protected from other malfunctioning applications, while physically sharing resources such as processors and communication networks. To guarantee timing constraints and dependability of each application, an IMA-based system must be equipped with strong partitioning schemes. Based on ARINC IMA standards, we refer a model as strongly partitioned distributed real-time system which composed of three major parts that are Avionics Subsystem, End System and Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) Communication System. We build the two-level scheduling hierarchy architecture model of Avionics Subsystem to provide spatial and temporal partitioning for real-time applications. End system provides communication interface for Avionics Subsystem and AFDX Communication system. AFDX Communication system provides reliable message transmission among applications. To evaluate the performance of an IMA-based system, simulation tool based on the discrete event system simulation method has been developed. The simulation captures additional characteristics of the system with respect to the analytical study, which is basically used to evaluate worst cases and deterministic guarantees. The tool is designed to help platform designer, applications developer and system integrator to describe and evaluate different implementation choices.					li, xin/HHS-9461-2022														2155-7195		978-1-4244-4077-1				2009							1679	+																WOS:000279662700154

X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that they are extremely similar in structure and crystallized in triclinic space group P1. An edge-sharing metallic dimer and 4 metallic monomers assemble with 18 carboxylate groups to form discrete inorganic rod-shaped building units [Ln(6)(CO2)(18)], which link to each other through phenyl groups to lead to three-dimensional open frameworks with approximately 4 x 6 A rhombic channels along the [0,-1,1] direction.

In this paper, a new design of distributed network coding is introduced. The proposed design are based on algebraic constructions in Finite Fields using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). These set of codes provides an alternative to Generalized Dynamic Network Codes (GDNC) and are based on the Hamming distance metric. Using this metric, the codes have maximum diversity and scales over large networks. In our work, we show that a compromise on the Field Size becomes necessary for enforcing the distributed Network codes over large networks. While the diversity offered by these codes are optimum, a unique feature of these codes are the ease of generation and scalability to larger network sizes. Results are provided and compared with theoretical evaluations.																			2154-0357		978-1-4799-8802-0				2015							264	267																WOS:000380559000036

First, based on the relative outputs, a full-order unknown input observer (UIO) is designed for each agent to track the full states' error among neighboring agents. With the aid of such an observer, a discontinuous feedback protocol is subtly designed. And it is proven that consensus tracking can be achieved in the closed-loop networked system if the average dwell time (ADT) for switching among different interaction graph candidates is larger than a given positive threshold. By using the boundary layer technique, a continuous feedback protocol is skillfully designed and employed. It is shown that the consensus error converges into a bounded set under the designed continuous protocol. Second, as part of the full states' error can be constructed via the agents' outputs, a reduced-order UIO is thus designed based on which discontinuous and continuous feedback protocols are, respectively, proposed. By using the stability theory of the switched systems, it is proven that the consensus error converges asymptotically to 0 under the designed discontinuous protocol, and converges into a bounded set under the designed continuous protocol. Finally, the obtained theoretical results are validated through simulations.

First, the nonlinear H-infinity control problem is transformed into solving the two-player zero-sum differential game problem of the nonlinear system. Then, the critic, action and disturbance networks are designed by using neural networks to solve online the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation associating with the two-player zero-sum differential game. When novel weight update laws for the critic, action and disturbance networks are tuned online by using data generated in real-time along the system trajectories, it is shown that the system states, all neural networks weight estimation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded by using Lyapunov techniques. Further, it is shown that the output of the action network approaches the optimal control input with small bounded error and the output of the disturbance network approaches the worst disturbance with small bounded error. At last, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new ADP based method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to forwarding packets, routers mix (i.e., code) packets from different sources to increase the information content of each transmission. We show that intelligently mixing packets increases network throughput. Our design is rooted in the theory of network coding. Prior work on network coding is mainly theoretical and focuses on multicast traffic. This paper aims to bridge theory with practice; it addresses the common case of unicast traffic, dynamic and potentially bursty flows, and practical issues facing the integration of network coding in the current network stack. We evaluate our design on a 20-node wireless network, and discuss the results of the first testbed deployment of wireless network coding. The results show that COPE largely increases network throughput. The gains vary from a few percent to several folds depending on the traffic pattern, congestion level, and transport protocol.

In many cases, the fibers are designed for negligible direct coupling of optical power among the cores. The cores remain, however, embedded in a single, mechanically-unified cladding. Elastic (or acoustic) modes supported by the fiber cladding geometry are in overlap with multiple cores. Acoustic waves may be stimulated by light in any core through electrostriction. Once excited, the acoustic waves may induce photo-elastic perturbations to optical waves in other cores as well. Such opto-mechanical coupling gives rise to inter-core cross-phase modulation effects, even when direct optical crosstalk is very weak. The cross-phase modulation spectrum reaches hundreds of megahertz frequencies. It may consist of discrete and narrow peaks, or may become quasi-continuous, depending on the geometric layout. The magnitude of the effect at the resonance frequencies is comparable with that of intra-core cross-phase modulation due to Kerr nonlinearity. Two potential applications are demonstrated: single-frequency opto-electronic oscillators that do not require radio-frequency electrical filters, and point-sensing of liquids outside the cladding of multi-core fibers, where light cannot reach.

Priority ranking towards condition assessment of existing reinforced concrete bridges	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING												Existing old bridges in most countries were designed for less traffic and are inadequate to carry current-day traffic and satisfy the present codal provisions. Even for newer bridges, deterioration caused by unforeseen service conditions and deferred maintenance is causing great concern to bridge engineers. Hence, there is an urgent need for a systematic methodology for priority ranking of the bridges for both their rehabilitation in the future and for the allocation of funding. In this paper, an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is an efficient decision making tool for complicated problems with multiple evaluation criteria and uncertainty, has been proposed for the condition ranking of reinforced concrete (RC) bridges. Fuzzy logic is used to handle the subjective judgement, imprecision and intuition involved in a bridge inspector's evaluation report. This methodology would certainly help engineers and bridge management policy makers to overcome the problems related to prioritization and decisions on funding related to the rehabilitation of bridges. The background information, the formulation and the details of the computer program developed in this study for the condition ranking of bridges are presented in this paper. The methodology and its application are demonstrated through a case study.					SASMAL, SAPTARSHI/AAC-1465-2022; Ramanjaneyulu, DR.

Following the protocol development, however, the communicating parties have not benefitted from the potential of multiple interfaces, now commonly installed at the end-point devices. In order to grasp new opportunities, a multipath version of TCP-multipath TCP (MPTCP)-has recently been introduced. It permits the simultaneous use of a few, diverse interfaces for enhancing the user experience. This article provides a discrete-time model of the data exchange process in the MPTCP framework and new flow control algorithms. The algorithms, applicable to the paths with nonhomogenous properties with respect to delays, loss rate, etc., are designed following the rules of discrete sliding-mode control (DSMC). As a result, direct implementation in discrete networking context and robust transmission system performance are guaranteed in uncertain operating conditions. It is formally demonstrated that a finite data queue length in the end-point buffers and a feasible (non-negative and bounded) input signal are ensured despite input and output perturbations affecting the control process. It is also shown that the classical DSMC design approach results in decreased performance for unanticipated surge in the intensity of network-related perturbations. A second, improved algorithm, with a well-chosen sliding variable, eliminates this drawback.

For data center networks, deadline missing rate and average flow completion time are two main metrics for the performance of applications. In this paper, we find deadline-aware methods can only reduce the percentage of flows missing deadline, while flowsize-aware and information-cumulative methods can only optimize the average flow completion time. However, traffic in data center is the mixture of various flows and focusing on the single goal is not enough. We advocate to incorporate deadline and flow duration time into flow rate control. Then we design DAFD (Deadline-Aware and Flow Duration) based rate control mechanism and analyze its performance in theory. At last, we evaluate DAFD under different topologies, real world traffic and load scenarios, both by simulation and in real testbed. Our results show that DAFD performs close to (DTCP)-T-2 and about 15, 25, 30, 35 better than Ameon, (LDCT)-D-2, Karuna, DCTCP on deadline missing rate. For average FCT, the performance of DAFD is similar to (LDCT)-D-2 and compared with Ameon, (DTCP)-T-2, Karuna, DCTCP, DAFD can reduce average FCT by 10, 15, 20, 25.

This paper design a DNN accelerator using mixed input and output data reuse scheme to achieve balance between internal memory size and memory access amount, two contradictory design goals in resource limited embedded systems. First, analytical forms for memory size and accesses are derived for different data reuse methods in DNN convolution. After comparing the analysis results across different convolutional layers of the VGG-16 model with different levels of hardware parallelism, we implement a low-cost DNN hardware accelerator using mixed input and output data reuse scheme with 32 processing elements (PEs) operating in parallel. Furthermore, the design supports two precision modes (8-bit and 16-bit) allowing variable precision requirements across DNN layers, resulting in more efficient computation compared with single-precision designs through sharing of hardware resource.

We begin with modeling a DSCSM on multiple digraphs and consequently construct a global Lyapunov function based on the topological structure of multiple digraphs. Using the Lyapunov method combined with the graph theory and the supermartingale convergence theorem, several stability criteria for DSCSM are derived. In what follows, the given results are utilized to analyze a stochastic coupled oscillator model.

An integrated approach of three well-known branches of artificial intelligence, namely artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GA), and knowledge based expert system (KBES) are applied in this study. ANNs are used to predict the three main properties of HPC, namely workability, strength, and durability, which are used to evaluate fitness and constraint violations in the GA process. Multilayer back-propagation neural networks are trained using the results obtained from experiments and previous research. The correlation between concrete components and its properties is established. GA is employed to arrive at an optimal mix proportion of HPC by minimizing its total cost. A system prototype, called High Performance Concrete Mix-Design System using Genetic Algorithm and Neural Networks (HPCGANN), was developed in MATLAB. The architecture of the proposed system consists of three main parts: 1) KBES user intreface; 2) ANNs prediction models software; and 3) GA engine software. The validation of the proposed system is carried out by comparing the results obtained from the system with the trial batches. The results indicate that the proposed system can be used to enable the design of HPC mix which corresponds to its required performance.																					978-0-415-55803-7				2009							1057	+																WOS:000280544200163

A Digital-to-Channel Microfluidic Interface via Inkjet Printing of Silver and UV Curing of Thiol-Enes	ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES												Microfluidic sample manipulation is a key enabler in modern chemical biology research. Both discrete droplet-based digital microfluidic (DMF) assays and continuous flow in-channel assays are well established, each featuring unique advantages from the viewpoint of automation and parallelization. However, there are marked differences in the applicable microfabrication materials and methods, which limit the interfacing of DMF sample preparation with in-channel separation systems, such as the gold standard microchip electrophoresis. Simultaneously, there is an increasing demand for low-cost and user-friendly manufacturing techniques to foster the adaptation of microfluidic technology in routine laboratory analyses. This work demonstrates integration of DMF with in-channel separation systems using only low-cost and accessible (non-cleanroom) manufacturing techniques, i.e., inkjet printing of silver for patterning of the driving electrodes and UV curing of off-stoichiometric thiol-ene (OSTE) polymers both for dielectric coating of the electrode arrays and replica molding of the microchannel network. As a dielectric, OSTE performs similar to Parylene C (a gold standard dielectric in electrowetting), whereas its tunable surface and bulk properties facilitate straightforward bonding of the microchannel with the dielectric layer. In addition, a new chip design that facilitates efficient droplet transfer from the DMF part to the microchannel inlet solely by electrowetting is showcased.

Philip			Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Control Based on Neural Approximation for Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems With Unknown Nonaffine Dead-Zone Input	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												In this paper, an optimal control algorithm is designed for uncertain nonlinear systems in discrete-time, which are in nonaffine form and with unknown dead-zone. The main contributions of this paper are that an optimal control algorithm is for the first time framed in this paper for nonlinear systems with nonaffine dead-zone, and the adaptive parameter law for dead-zone is calculated by using the gradient rules. The mean value theory is employed to deal with the nonaffine dead-zone input and the implicit function theory based on reinforcement learning is appropriately introduced to find an unknown ideal controller which is approximated by using the action network. Other neural networks are taken as the critic networks to approximate the strategic utility functions. Based on the Lyapunov stability analysis theory, we can prove the stability of systems, i.e., the optimal control laws can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the tracking errors are converged to a small compact set. Finally, two simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the design algorithm.					liu, yan/HGV-1365-2022; liu, yan/HCI-5542-2022; Li, Shu/AAT-1778-2021; Chen, Ci/ISU-4741-2023; 刘, 严君/GZL-5764-2022	Chen, Ci/0000-0003-0813-5543; 													2162-237X	2162-2388				JAN	2019	30	1					295	305		10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2844165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2844165								29994726					WOS:000454329300024

In this study, interpenetrating nanocomposites of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) tungsten-silicon oxycarbide (W-SiOC) were prepared, and their mechanical properties were investigated. In these nanocomposites, the crystalline tungsten and amorphous silicon oxycarbide phases both form continuous and interpenetrating networks, with some discrete free carbon nanodomains. The W-SiOC material inherits the periodic structure from its 3DOM W matrix, and this periodic structure can be maintained up to 1000 degrees C. In situ SEM micropillar compression tests demonstrated that the 3DOM W-SiOC material could sustain a maximum average stress of 1.1 GPa, a factor of 22 greater than that of the 3DOM W matrix, resulting in a specific strength of 640 MPa/(Mg/m(3)) at 30 degrees C. Deformation behavior of the developed 3DOM nanocomposite in a wide temperature range (30-575 degrees C) was investigated. The deformation mode of 3DOM W-SiOC exhibited a transition from fracture-dominated deformation at low temperatures to plastic deformation above 425 degrees C.

Current selection meth-ods for defense timing are based on the decision-making model of a discrete time series structure, and they present problems such as inadequate real-time performance for contin-uous decision-making. Based on the dynamic temporospatial confrontation characteristics of network attack and defense, this paper proposes an improved moving target defense model based on the multidimensional transition of exploration-attack-detection surfaces, analyzes the characteristics of attack-defense games for moving target defense (MTD) and temporospatial strategies, and describes the characteristics of stealth interaction based on the Fliplt MTD system security state evolution. We use the game to analyze continuous net -work attack-defense processes to build an MTD temporospatial decision-making model. We quantify the attacker's and defender's utilities, design a saddle-point strategy solution, and develop an optimal temporospatial defense strategy selection algorithm. We use applica-tion examples and numerical analysis results to show that the model and algorithm are accurate and effective. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A trust region framework for heat exchanger network synthesis with detailed individual heat exchanger designs	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												We develop a trust region filter strategy for simultaneous optimal design of heat exchanger networks that includes detailed design of shell-and-tube heat exchangers. The strategy first solves a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation with shortcut models to generate candidate network topologies, which are then used in a non-isothermal mixing nonlinear programming (NLP) suboptimization with detailed optimal exchanger design models embedded using a modified trust region filter (TRF) algorithm. An integer cut based strategy is used to bound the solutions from MINLP and the NLP which aids in convergence to the solution of the overall simultaneous design problem. Under assumptions, the TRF based strategy can guarantee convergence to near optimal solutions of the overall design problem. The presented solution strategy is thus able to find optimal heat exchanger network designs based on the simultaneous optimization of the network topology and mass and energy balances, together with detailed shell-and-tube heat exchanger optimization, including the number of shell and tube passes, pressure drops, and tubes, tube lengths, etc. The proposed strategy is tested on three literature based case studies and their results are compared with previous studies to showcase its performance.

This process requires the implementation of measures to prevent low-quality welds that can lead to the disposal of an entire structure. In this article, a machine learning-based method is introduced that uses experimental data to detect and classify defective stud welds. The source of data is a series of experimental arc stud welds conducted by a precision robotic arm. Welding data log is recorded through various sensors to shape a multivariate dataset for ASW. Then, wavelet transforms (WTs) as well as synthetic signal generation are applied for feature extraction. For each set of extracted features, suitable models are designed, trained, and evaluated for automatic root cause classification. Next, the models and approaches are compared on synthetic measurement generation, feature extractions, and feature importance. Numerical results show that XGBoost, the best model, has an 85.41% F1-score on the test set. Additionally, the study reveals that voltage and lift play crucial roles in the root cause classification of arc stud weld. The proposed method not only offers promising results for defect detection in ASW but also provides outreach value for similar industrial processes.

Reliability assessment of energy systems integrated with renewable sources, and in particular wind farms, has been studied by several researchers recently. To deal with uncertainties in the energy sources, a number of methods have been proposed to model and predict their behavior. Different from the existing methods which are mainly discrete-time approaches, we propose in this paper an efficient method for optimal online prediction founded upon stochastic analysis of continuous-time Markov chains. The key feature of the chain is identified and the optimal online prediction problem reduces to a quiet simpler one by means of the Markov property. Performance indicators are stated and the method is illustrated on real data. The guarantee of reliability is still as objective underlying the second part of this paper which addresses the problem of optimal control of wind turbines. A power tracking controller, for some given set point reference, which is to operate in two switching regimes, is to be designed using the dynamic programming principle. The controller derivation is based on (i) a nonlinear electromechanically coupled model for variable-speed wind turbines with doubly fed induction generators, and (ii) the wind speed stochastic model provided by the first part of the paper.																			2166-9546		978-1-5386-2508-8				2018										10.1109/CPE.2018.8372492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CPE.2018.8372492													WOS:000443797900008

However, development of such is also highly challenging. Despite the efforts and progress thus far, no definitive guidelines or solutions are available worldwide for quantitatively designing a monitoring network in response to river chemical spill incidents, except general rules based on administrative divisions or arbitrary interpolation on routine monitoring sections. To address this gap, a novel framework for spatial-temporal network design was proposed in this study. The framework combines contaminant transport modelling with discrete entropy theory and spectral analysis. The water quality model was applied to forecast the spatio-temporal distribution of contaminant after spills and then corresponding information transfer. indexes (ITIs) and Fourier approximation periodic functions were estimated as critical measures for setting sampling locations and times. The results indicate that the framework can produce scientific preparedness plans of emergency monitoring based on scenario analysis of spill risks as well as rapid design as soon as the incident happened but not prepared. The framework was applied to a hypothetical spill case based on tracer experiment and a real nitrobenzene spill incident case to demonstrate its suitability and effectiveness. The newly-designed temporal-spatial monitoring network captured major pollution information at relatively low costs. It showed obvious benefits for follow-up early-warning and treatment as well as for aftermath recovery and assessment. The underlying drivers of ITIs as well as the limitations and uncertainty of the approach were analyzed based on the case studies. Comparison with existing monitoring network design approaches, management implications, and generalized applicability were also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, H; Zhang, RS; Liu, X				Li, Huan; Zhang, Ruisheng; Liu, Xin			An efficient discrete differential evolution algorithm based on community structure for influence maximization	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE												As one of the main contents of influence analysis, influence maximization is selecting a group of influential nodes with specified size in a given network to form a seed node set, and the influence spread cascaded by the selected seed node set can be maximized under a given propagation model. The research of influence maximization is helpful to understand social network and viral marketing. How to develop an effective algorithm to solve this problem in large-scale networks is still a challenge. In this paper, a discrete differential evolution algorithm based on community structure (CDDE) is proposed. At first, the fast Louvain algorithm is used to detect the community structure. On this basis, significant communities are defined and candidate nodes are extracted from each significant community. And then, an improved discrete differential evolution algorithm is proposed to obtain influential nodes. Furthermore, a population initialization strategy based on candidate nodes is designed, and the candidate nodes are also used to accelerate the discrete evolution process of the population. Experimental results on six real-world social networks show that the proposed CDDE is competitive with the comparison algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, and achieves comparable influence spread to CELF.

This general discrete-time model, which is the interconnection of a linear delayed dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator, covers not only several well-known discrete-time delayed neural networks, such as Hopfield neural networks, cellular neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional associative memory (BAM) networks, and recurrent multilayer perceptrons (RMLPs), but also Lur'e systems. Based on Lyapunov stability and H-infinity control theories, dynamic output feedback controllers are established to not only guarantee exponentially stable synchronization of both master and slave systems with time delays, but also reduce the effect of external disturbance to an H-infinity-norm constraint. Furthermore, two classes of optimal controllers are presented, one minimizing the H-infinity-norm bound, the other maximizing the exponential synchronization rate. The control design equations are shown to be a set of linear matrix inequality (LMI) standard problems which can be easily solved by various convex optimization algorithms to determine the optimal H-infinity control laws and the optimal exponential synchronization rates.																			0743-1546		978-1-4244-3872-3				2009							6744	6749		10.1109/CDC.2009.5399651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5399651													WOS:000336893607041

Current technology allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to renegotiate contracts online to maximize profits. Changing link prices will influence interdomain routing policies that are now driven by monetary aspects as well as global resource and performance optimization. In this article, we consider an interdomain routing game in which the ISP's action is to set the price for its transit links. Assuming a cheapest path routing scheme, the optimal action is the price setting that yields the highest utility (i.e., profit) and depends both on the network load and the actions of other ISPs. We adapt a continuous and a discrete action learning automaton (LA) to operate in this framework as a tool that can be used by ISP operators to learn optimal price setting. In our model, agents representing different ISPs learn only on the basis of local information and do not need any central coordination or sensitive information exchange. Simulation results show that a single ISP employing LAs is able to learn the optimal price in a stationary environment. By introducing a selective exploration rule, LAs are also able to operate in nonstationary environments. When two ISPs employ LAs, we show that they converge to stable and fair equilibrium strategies.

The problem is investigated in discrete-time state space using Lyapunov's stability theory and the linear inequality matrix technique. A new discrete-time modeling approach is developed to describe a networked control system (NCS) with parameter uncertainties and nonideal network QoS. It integrates a network-induced delay, packet dropout, and other network behaviors into a unified framework. With this modeling, an improved stability condition, which is dependent on the lower and upper bounds of the equivalent network-induced delay, is established for the NCS with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. It is further extended for the output feedback stabilization of the NCS with nonideal QoS. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the main results of the theoretical development.					刘, 钊/H-1520-2015; Yue, Dong/ITW-1908-2023; Tian, Yu-Chu/I-9948-2012; peng, chen/HHS-8720-2022; Yue, Dong/ITW-1999-2023	Yue, Dong/0000-0001-7810-9338; Tian, Yu-Chu/0000-0002-8709-5625; peng, chen/0000-0003-3652-2233; 													1083-4427					JAN	2011	41	1					185	190		10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2055155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2055155													WOS:000284095400017

Material selection of each part is always formulated as a categorical design variable in structural optimization problems. However, it is difficult to solve such mixed-variable problems using the metamodelbased strategy, because the prediction accuracy of metamodels deteriorates significantly when categorical variables exist. This paper investigates two different strategies of mixed-variable metamodeling: the "feature separating" strategy and the "all-in-one" strategy. A supervised learning-enhanced cokriging method is proposed, which fuses multi-fidelity information to predict new designs' responses. The proposed method is compared with several existing mixed-variable metamodeling methods to understand their pros and cons. These methods include Neural Network (NN) regression, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Gaussian Process (GP). This study provides insights and guidance on the establishment of proper metamodels for multi-material structural design problems.

For this purpose, a novel decentralized data-driven online control scheme for cooperating vehicles in multi-objective monitoring scenarios is presented in this paper. In the considered use case, multiple UAVs are to adaptively gather measurements for estimating the parameters of an atmospheric dispersion model. At the same time, they are required to cooperatively patrol predefined checkpoints. Vehicle-specific optimal waypoints for each UAV are determined by sequential optimum design. Following these waypoints leads to a maximized information gain of the acquired measurements, such that the parameter estimate is iteratively improved. On the other hand, checkpoint allocation as well as trajectory planning is provided by a decentralized model-predictive controller based on a discrete-time mixed-integer linear problem formulation. By permanent interaction of parameter estimation, waypoint calculation, and cooperative control, a fully optimization-based, yet efficient and adaptive feedback control approach is obtained. Simulations successfully demonstrate its effectiveness. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we propose Upright-Net, a deep-learning-based approach for estimating the upright orientation of 3D point clouds. Based on a well-known postulate of design states that "form ever follows function", we treat the natural base of an object as a common functional structure, which supports the object in a most commonly seen pose following a set of specific rules, e.g. physical laws, functionality-related geometric properties, semantic cues, and so on. Thus we apply a data-driven deep learning method to automatically encode those rules and formulate the upright orientation estimation problem as a classification model, i.e. extract the points on a 3D model that forms the natural base. And then the upright orientation is computed as the normal of the natural base. Our proposed new approach has three advantages. First, it formulates the continuous orientation estimation task as a discrete classification task while preserving the continuity of the solution space. Second, it automatically learns the comprehensive criteria defining a natural base of general 3D models even with asymmetric geometry. Third, the learned orientation-aware features can serve well in downstream tasks. Results show that our network outperforms previous approaches on orientation estimation and also achieves remarkable generalization capability and transfer capability.

A Variable-Gain Low-Noise Transimpedance Amplifier for Miniature Ultrasound Probes	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS					IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)	FEB 16-20, 2020	San Francisco, CA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, SSCS, Univ Penn				This article presents a low-noise transimpedance amplifier (TIA) designed for miniature ultrasound probes. It provides continuously variable gain to compensate for the time-dependent attenuation of the received echo signal. This time-gain compensation (TGC) compresses the echo-signal dynamic range (DR) while avoiding imaging artifacts associated with discrete gain steps. Embedding the TGC function in the TIA reduces the output DR, saving power compared to prior solutions that apply TGC after the low-noise amplifier. The TIA employs a capacitive ladder feedback network and a current-steering circuit to obtain a linear-in-dB gain range of 37 dB. A variable-gain loop amplifier based on current-reuse stages maintains constant bandwidth in a power-efficient manner. The TIA has been integrated in a 64-channel ultrasound transceiver application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) in a 180-nm BCDMOS process and occupies a die area of 0.12 mm(2). It achieves a gain error below +/- 1 dB and a 1.7 pA/root Hz noise floor and consumes 5.2 mW from a +/- 0.9 V supply. B-mode images of a tissue-mimicking phantom are presented that show the benefits of the TGC scheme.

Modelling capacity along a patient pathway with delays to transfer and discharge	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY												This article presents a versatile model to estimate capacity requirements along a patient pathway with delays to transfer and discharge caused by blocking after service. Blocking after service is a common property in health systems where patients requiring uninterrupted care can only leave a service when they can be admitted downstream to another. Unlike many studies, the approach appreciates both variability in arrivals and length of stay at each service point and the stochastic queuing dynamics between them. This is crucial to the understanding and identification of blockages which can present a significant source of inefficiency. The problem is framed as a continuous-time Markov chain where patient arrivals, transfers, and discharges are modelled through state transitions, with length of stay approximated by the Erlang distribution. The solution is through simulating movements around this chain by dynamically sampling the next state accessible from the neighbourhood of the current, thus bypassing the need for time-intensive manipulations of equations involving the entire transition matrix. This is packaged in easy-to-use code in free software so as to be readily available to healthcare practitioners. An example of use is illustrated for a stroke pathway reconfiguration where move to a centralised hyper-acute service is assessed.

In order to prevent the catastrophic collapse of subway tunnels from intrusion events, this paper investigated the capability of detecting the ground intrusion of underground structures based on dynamic measurement of distributed fiber optic sensing. For an actual subway tunnel monitored by the ultra-weak fiber optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensing fiber with a spatial resolution of five meters, a simulated experiment of the ground intrusion along the selected path was designed and implemented, in which a hydraulic excavator was chosen to exert intrusion perturbations with different strengths and modes at five selected intrusion sites. For each intrusion place, the distributed vibration responses of sensing fibers mounted on the tunnel wall and the track bed were detected to identify the occurrence and characteristics of the intrusion event simulated by the discrete and continuous pulses of the excavator under two loading postures. By checking the on-site records of critical moments in the intrusion process, the proposed detection approach based on distributed structural vibration responses for the ground intrusion can detect the occurrence of intrusion events, locate the intrusion ground area, and distinguish intrusion strength and typical perturbation modes.					lin, yuan/JXL-9592-2024; Sun, Lizhi Z/C-5205-2008	Sun, Lizhi Z/0000-0001-9043-6526; LI, ZHENGYING/0000-0002-4600-2795														1424-8220				MAY 1	2019	19	9							2160	10.3390/s19092160	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19092160								31075963					WOS:000469766800204

In this type of complex, dynamical systems, the primary obstacle in the design of efficient control is the delay in the feedback loop which may be subject to significant fluctuations during the control process. This paper presents a new approach to solving the congestion problem in multisource networks, in which each flow is characterized by different and time-varying delay, with the application of discrete-time sliding-mode control. The proposed controller, operating at a network node, guarantees that in the considered networks the packet losses are eliminated and all of the available bandwidth at the node output interface is used for the data transfer. The controller is demonstrated to be robust with respect to the abrupt and unpredictable changes of networking conditions, such as delay and bandwidth variations, which need not be correlated with each other. The controller parameters are selected by minimizing a quadratic cost functional. A closed-form solution of the optimization problem allows for a straightforward and operationally efficient implementation of the proposed congestion control strategy in real network nodes.

In this paper, we present a novel unified framework for marketing budget allocation. By leveraging abundant data, the proposed data-driven approach can help us to overcome the challenges and make more informed decisions. In our approach, a semi-black-box model is built to forecast the dynamic market response and an efficient optimization method is proposed to solve the complex allocation task. First, the response in each market-segment is forecasted by exploring historical data through a semi-black-box model, where the capability of logit demand curve is enhanced by neural networks. The response model reveals relationship between sales and marketing cost. Based on the learned model, budget allocation is then formulated as an optimization problem, and we design efficient algorithms to solve it in both continuous and discrete settings. Several kinds of business constraints are supported in one unified optimization paradigm, including cost upper bound, profit lower bound, or ROI lower bound. The proposed framework is easy to implement and readily to handle large-scale problems. It has been successfully applied to many scenarios in Alibaba Group. The results of both offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate its effectiveness.																					978-1-4503-6201-6				2019							1820	1830		10.1145/3292500.3330700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330700													WOS:000485562501087

In this study, in order to overcome the drawbacks of existing tunnel lighting control modes that disregard the color temperature of natural light characteristics and collaborative influence of color temperature and luminance of natural light on tunnel lighting quality, one artificial neural network (ANN) model is designed and trained to simulate one physical lighting control system that takes into consideration color temperature and luminance simultaneously. In this model, multiple parameters of discrete and continuous types of input layer and output layer are synergistically analyzed. The model was also trained with quantities of field data from one tunnel in service and includes one hidden layer with 10 neurons. The simulation results showed that this model obtains a high degree of fitness with inside luminance and 100% recognition rate with inside color temperature in the threshold zone, which conforms to the regulation strategy of actual lighting control systems with high confidence. The proposed model will greatly enhance the reliability and sustainability of the lighting system during its normal operation, which can also support other lighting scenarios due to its flexibility and scalability with multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) capabilities.

SpArcFiRe: Enhancing Spiral Galaxy Recognition Using Arm Analysis and Random Forests	GALAXIES												Automated quantification of galaxy morphology is necessary because the size of upcoming sky surveys will overwhelm human volunteers. Existing classification schemes are inadequate because (a) their uncertainty increases near the boundary of classes and astronomers need more control over these uncertainties; (b) galaxy morphology is continuous rather than discrete; and (c) sometimes we need to know not only the type of an object, but whether a particular image of the object exhibits visible structure. We propose that regression is better suited to these tasks than classification, and focus specifically on determining the extent to which an image of a spiral galaxy exhibits visible spiral structure. We use the human vote distributions from Galaxy Zoo 1 (GZ1) to train a random forest of decision trees to reproduce the fraction of GZ1 humans who vote for the Spiral class. We prefer the random forest model over other black box models like neural networks because it allows us to trace post hoc the precise reasoning behind the regression of each image. Finally, we demonstrate that using features from SpArcFiRea code designed to isolate and quantify arm structure in spiral galaxiesimproves regression results over and above using traditional features alone, across a sample of 470,000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

It is envisioned that in the future government agencies will dedicate certain areas of road networks to AVs only to facilitate the formulation of vehicle platoons to improve throughput and hopefully improve the performance of the whole network. This paper aims to present a mathematical framework for the optimal design of AV zones in a general network. With the presence of AV zones, AVs may apply different routing principles outside of and within the AV zones. A novel network equilibrium model (we refer to it as the "mixed routing equilibrium model") is thus firstly proposed to capture such mixed-routing behaviors. We then proceed to formulate a mixed-integer bi-level programming model to optimize the deployment plan of AV zones.

The unknown nonlinear functions, dead-zone input and external disturbance are all considered in the studied SFDTS. Before starting to design the controller, the MIMO SFDTS is transformed into a maximum N-step ahead predictor to solve the noncausal problem. Then, the backstepping method is successfully used to design the control scheme for the new system. The unknown nonlinear functions are approximated by radial basis function neural networks. The external disturbance is estimated based on the DO, and the ANN controller is designed on the basis of the outputs of the DO. By applying the Lyapunov stability theory, all the signals in the whole closed-loop system are ensured bounded. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to verify the validity of the proposed control scheme. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

It is supposed that each node's output measurement transmitted to its filter according to Round-Robin scheduling protocol. Based on a non-parallel distributed compensation strategy, distributed filters are constructed, where the coupling matrix between filters could be different from the one between nodes and the parameters of the filters depend on current and delayed membership functions. The augmented filtering error system is represented as a discrete-time fuzzy system with time-varying delays. By applying a novel nonquadratic Lyapunov functional that depends on current and delayed membership functions, and combined with a Abel lemma-based finite-sum inequality, distributed regional filters are designed such that the local and exponential stability of the augmented filtering error system is ensured and the performance requirement is satisfied. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed method.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				SEP 14	2017	11	14					2370	2382		10.1049/iet-cta.2017.0071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2017.0071													WOS:000409425700022

Aiming to improve the secondary users' secrecy rates, a design problem for jointly optimizing the transmission beamforming of secondary base station (SBS), the IRS's reflecting coefficient and the channel allocation is formulated under the constraints of the requirements of minimum data rates of primary users and the interference between users. As the scenario is highly complex, it is quite challenging to address the non-convexity of the optimization problem. Thus, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach is taken into consideration. Specifically, we use dueling double deep Q networks (D3QN) and soft Actor-Critic (SAC) to solve the discrete and continuous action space optimization problems, respectively, taking full advantage of the maximum entropy RL algorithm to explore all possible optimal paths. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed approach has a great improvement in security transmission rate compared with the scheme without IRS and OFDM, and our proposed D3QN-SAC approach is more effective than other approaches in terms of maximum security transmission rate.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

At the end of the response, the remaining CD8 T cells are antigen-specific memory cells that will respond stronger and faster in case they are presented this very same antigen again. We propose a nonlinear multiscale mathematical model of the CD8 T cell immune response describing dynamics of two inter-connected physical scales. At the intracellular scale, the level of expression of key proteins involved in proliferation, death, and differentiation of CD8 T cells is modeled by a delay differential system whose dynamics define maturation velocities of CD8 T cells. At the population scale, the amount of CD8 T cells is represented by a discrete density and cell fate depends on their intracellular content. We introduce the model, then show essential mathematical properties (existence, uniqueness, positivity) of solutions and analyse their asymptotic behavior based on the behavior of the intracellular regulatory network. We numerically illustrate the model's ability to qualitatively reproduce both primary and secondary responses, providing a preliminary tool for investigating the generation of long-lived CD8 memory T cells and vaccine design.					michel, philippe/ABG-1781-2020	Crauste, Fabien/0000-0002-9979-9638													1531-3492	1553-524X				NOV	2018	23	9					3969	4002		10.3934/dcdsb.2018120	http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/dcdsb.2018120													WOS:000445290400022

Regenerator Site Selection in Mixed Line Rate Waveband Optical Networks	JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING												Optical networks that support mixed line rates can accommodate diverse connection requests without the need for traffic grooming by assigning the appropriate line rates to match the bandwidth requirements of requests. Higher line rates offer the advantage of a lower per-unit cost of transmission but may suffer from more impairments compared to lower line rates. These impairments result in shorter optical reach for high line rate signals, necessitating the use of electronic regenerators to restore the signal quality. We formulate the regenerator site selection problem as an integer linear program and propose heuristics to solve the design problem in the context of waveband optical networks. We propose four heuristics and study the effect of regenerator site selection on the number of optical switch ports in waveband networks and the electronic cost.																			1943-0620	1943-0639				MAR	2013	5	3					198	209		10.1364/JOCN.5.000198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.5.000198													WOS:000317959500004
J	Li, SY; Wu, Q; Wang, R				Li, Shuyang; Wu, Qiang; Wang, Ran			Dynamic Discrete Topology Design and Routing for Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING												Satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STNs) are considered a promising architecture for 6G networks due to their ability to provide ubiquitous, high-capacity coverage on a global scale by combining satellite and terrestrial network infrastructures. However, the complex network architecture, time-varying topology, and frequent inter-satellite connection handovers present significant challenges for developing efficient routing and service continuity in STNs. To overcome these challenges, we propose Dyna-STN, a dynamic discrete topology-oriented wide-area routing mechanism in this paper. Dyna-STN utilizes a dynamic discrete topology model to characterize the time-varying topology of satellite networks. Furthermore, a hierarchical framework is established within the management plane to implement Dyna-STN, which comprises a dynamic discrete topology management plane and a routing management plane. A virtual overlay network composed of fixed virtual nodes shields the dynamics of satellite networks, while the open shortest path first protocol (OSPF) is deployed within the virtual overlay network to exchange routing reachability information among virtual nodes. Additionally, Dyna-STN performs dynamic binding and service migration between different satellite entities at specific time slots, thereby maintaining the continuity of virtual node services. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that Dyna-STN outperforms several baseline schemes in terms of routing protocol performance, packet forwarding performance, and service continuity. Furthermore, Dyna-STN maintains stable performance as the network scale increases and supports reliable data transmission among terminal devices in STNs.																			1063-6692	1558-2566				2024 MAY 17	2024										10.1109/TNET.2024.3397613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2024.3397613		MAY 2024											WOS:001226163800001

A Fast, Scalable Meta-Heuristic for Network Slicing Under Traffic Uncertainty	APPLICATIONS OF EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, EVOAPPLICATIONS 2020	Lecture Notes in Computer Science				23rd European International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation (EvoApplications) Held as Part of EvoStar Conference	APR 15-17, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK					Perceived to be one of the cornerstones of the emerging next generation (5G) networks, Network slicing enables the accommodation of multiple logical networks with diverse performance requirements on a common substrate platform. Of particular interest among different facets of network slicing is the problem of designing an individual network slice tailored specifically to match the requirements of the big-bandwidth next generation network services. In this work, we present an exact formulation for the network slice design problem under traffic uncertainty. As the considered mathematical formulation is known to pose a high degree of computational difficulty to state-of-the-art commercial mixed integer programming solvers owing to the inclusion of robust constraints, we propose a meta-heuristic based on ant colony optimisation algorithms for the robust network slice design problem. Experimental evaluation conducted on realistic network topologies from SNDlib reveals that the proposed meta-heuristic can indeed be an efficient alternative to the commercial mixed integer programming solvers.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-030-43721-3; 978-3-030-43722-0				2020	12104						244	259		10.1007/978-3-030-43722-0_16	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43722-0_16													WOS:000896394100016

In the first step, a filter is designed to make the discrete-time system stochastically stable, and make the H infinity$$ {H}_{\infty } $$ norm between the filtering error and the external disturbance less than a given level. In the second step, two dynamic quantizers, which quantify the measurement output signal and the performance output signal, respectively, are designed under the condition that the filter gain matrices are obtained. In addition, the filter adopted in this paper takes the randomly occurring uncertainty into consideration, and the quantizers are designed by an inequality scaling technique which can reduce the complexity of linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, this paper also considers the data packet dropout that may occur during network transmission. Finally, considering the data packet dropout and quantization of measurement output signal and performance output signal, the effectiveness of the proposed filter design method is demonstrated by two simulation examples.

By considering two different types of bounded discrete-delays, two stability criteria are formulated respectively for the case where the information on the discrete-delay derivative is unknown and the case where the discrete-delay derivative be strictly less than one. It is shown that the first stability criterion is an essential improvement over the existing one in the literature. When the discrete-delay is constant, the second stability criterion is proved to be less conservative than the first stability criterion. Moreover, impulsive control law design for delayed RNNs is facilitated by adjustable parameters in the stability criteria. The usefulness of the theoretical findings is demonstrated by a numerical example.

Facility location decisions for drone delivery: A literature review	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												This study presents a comprehensive literature survey on facility location problems for drone (uncrewed vehicle) delivery, where either (i) drones are the only vehicles, or (ii) drones and other vehicles (e.g., trucks) work together for delivery, but drones do not ride in or on the other vehicles. The main goals of this review are to identify and categorize fundamental facility location problems associated with drone delivery, to document the large volume of research in this area, to provide a connection between the studies from different research fields that consider similar location problems, and to highlight promising areas for future research. We first discuss and classify the functions of drones and the various types of facilities used for drone and hybrid vehicle-drone (e.g., truck and drone, or transit and drone) delivery systems, including drone bases (fixed or temporary), other vehicle bases, recharging stations, (re)supply points, and platooning points. The literature is reviewed and categorized based on the types of vehicles involved and their interactions, the types of facilities located, the types of drones and the location space (discrete or continuous). Each category is analyzed in terms of the modeling approach, decision(s), the objective function(s), constraint(s) and additional feature(s). The paper concludes with some promising future research directions.						Y.

The mixed routing strategy consists of two parts. When the packet generation rate is small, the shortest paths are used to deliver the packets, while the packet generation rate is large, we use the local routing strategy. Numerical results shown that with proper design on the shifting instances between the two routing methods according to the traffic dynamic behavior, the mixed routing has better network performance than the shortest path routing and the local routing strategy.																			1948-9439		978-1-4673-5532-2; 978-1-4673-5533-9				2013							5048	5051																WOS:000326977305018

Administration of a successful supply chain depends on how efficiently the network design is accomplished. Therefore, a supply chain network design problem is considered in this paper. The network addresses an uncertain environment threatened by different risk sources in order to captivate the real world conditions. A mixed-integer non-linear mathematical model is developed in which the uncertainties are represented by the fuzzy set theory. Benders decomposition is then applied to solve the proposed problem; consequently, the model is transformed into a mixed-integer one. Moreover, an interactive resolution method is applied to provide the decision maker with alternative decision plans in regard to different satisfaction degrees. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed model is checked by sensitivity analysis test and its performance is considered by different numerical examples. (C) 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

By combining single neural network approximation and minimal learning parameter technique, the proposed approach is able to eliminate the complexity growing problem and alleviate the explosion of learning parameters. An auxiliary design system is incorporated into the control scheme to overcome the problem of input saturation constraints. Following this approach, the designed controller contains only one actual control law and one adaptive law, the numbers of input variables and weights of neural network updated online are decreased drastically, and the number of parameter updated online for whole system is reduced to only one. Compared with the existing methods, the adaptive mechanism with much simpler controller structure and minimal learning parameterization is achieved; therefore, the computational burden is lighter. It is shown via Lyapunov theory that all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results via two examples are employed to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed scheme.

The robot arm is assumed to have an upper and lower bound of its inertia matrix norm and its states are available for measurement. The discrete variable structure control serves two purposes, i.e., one is to force the system states to be within the state region in which neural networks are used when the system goes out of neural control; and the other is to improve the tracking performance within the NN approximation region. Main theory results for designing stable neural network-based sampled data indirect and direct adaptive controllers are given, and the extension of the proposed control approaches to the composite adaptive control of a flexible-link robot is discussed.

The randomly occurring uncertainties are assumed to satisfy Bernoulli distribution and the considered stochastic variables are mutually independent. Multiple communication channel scenario is taken into account to enhance the data transmission performance and the channel switching phenomena is governed by a Markov chain. The intention here is to design a dissipative-based non-fragile filter for the filtering error system such that it is stochastically finite-time bounded and attains a prescribed dissipative performance attenuation level. Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality approach are exploited to develop a set of sufficient criterion for the existence of the desired filter. Finally, the filter design framework is applied to the truck-trailer model to demonstrate its effectiveness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A multiple communication channels sharing-based compensation method is proposed to reduce the negative influences of network-induced delay and packet dropout. A new model, which can receive more than one control input packet during a control input updating time interval, for continuous-time networked control system is established. Based on the multiple communication channels sharing-based compensation method and the newly established model, the performance of networked control system is optimized. By defining a new Lyapunov functional and using Jensen integral inequality, the effective controller design criteria are derived. Even if without using the sharing of multiple communication channels, the newly derived controller design method is also applicable.

Various realistic assumptions are incorporated into the problem, which make the study valuable for performance assessment of real cellular networks to identify potentials for performance improvements in practical receiver designs. We assume that the continuous-time received signal is first discretized by mismatched filtering based on the imperfect CSIR. The resulting discrete-time signals are then decoded considering two different decoding strategies, i.e., an optimal decoding strategy based on specific statistics of channel estimation errors and a sub-optimal decoding strategy treating the estimation error signal as additive Gaussian noise. Motivated by the proposed decoding strategies, we study the performance of the decision feedback equalizer for finite constellation inputs, in which inter-stream interferences are treated either using their true statistics or as Gaussian noise. Numerical results are provided to exemplify the benefit of exploiting the knowledge on the statistics of the channel estimation errors and inter-stream interferences. Simulations also assess the effect of the CSI imperfectness on the achievable rate, which reveal that finite constellation inputs are less sensitive to the estimation accuracy than Gaussian input, especially in the high SNR regime.

An effective state observer is designed to obtain current states information, which can remove the restriction that the system can be converted to the input-output model. Subsequently, dissimilar to the n-step forward predictor with multiple neural networks (NNs) and n-step delays, variable substitution technique is used to avoid time delays and calculation burden of multiple NNs. ACD structure is constructed to acquire the optimal control strategy by critic and action NNs. An effective iterative strategy is adopted to deal with the approximation error of action NN. In this way, the update law of the controller is constructed, which is more reasonable and easier to be implemented. Meanwhile, ET mechanism is placed between the senor and the controller. A novel ET condition is constructed to moderate the burden of network communications and realize the ideal control performance. All the state signals are guaranteed to be bounded.

PREDICTIVE CONTROL OF CHAOTIC DISCRETE PLANTS	ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY-JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING												This paper deals with identification and predictive control of a nonlinear chaotic discrete plant. The main difficulties for identification and control of this plant arise from the strongly nonlinear center and its chaotic behavior. First, an internal feedback is applied to suppress the chaotic behavior. Then, a neural network based predictive controller using Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) is designed to govern the dynamics of this plant. The effectiveness of the purposed methodology is shown through simulation results.																			1303-0914						2007	7	1					277	285																WOS:000409727200002

The competitive interaction method allows us to design a network that protects the multi-agent systems from adversaries without requiring high network connectivity. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not require the global information about the number of adversaries. First, we show that the proposed distributed algorithm solves the resilient distributed optimization problem with no attack on the communication links. Second, we show that the proposed continuous-time distributed optimization algorithm on connected graphs converges to the small neighborhood of the optimal solution in the presence of cyber-attacks onto the communication channel. Simulations are presented to illustrate our theoretical results.

Reliability-based optimization considering design variables of discrete size	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES												This contribution presents an approach for performing reliability-based optimization (RBO) with emphasis on the treatment of discrete design variables. The key idea of the proposed approach is the construction of an approximate representation of the structural reliability (i.e. a meta-model for reliability). This allows replacing the original RBO problem with a series of approximate yet accurate subproblems. These approximate subproblems can be solved most efficiently using any appropriate optimization method. Application examples involving the design of steel frames illustrate the features of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To achieve this task, numerous methods that either focus on small scale networks or use evolutionary algorithms have been developed. Here, we propose a two-step approach to facilitate the design of functional circuits. In the first step, the search space of possible topologies for target functions is reduced by reverse engineering using a Boolean network model. In the second step, continuous simulation is applied to evaluate the performance of these topologies. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method by designing an example biological function: the SOS response of E. coli. Our numerical results show that the desired function can be faithfully reproduced by candidate networks with different parameters and initial conditions. Possible circuits are ranked according to their robustness against perturbations in parameter and gene expressions. The biological network is among the candidate networks, yet novel designs can be generated. Our method provides a scalable way to design robust circuits that can achieve complex functions, and makes it possible to uncover design principles of biological networks.

A parallel metaheuristic for large mixed-integer dynamic optimization problems, with applications in computational biology	PLOS ONE												Background We consider a general class of global optimization problems dealing with nonlinear dynamic models. Although this class is relevant to many areas of science and engineering, here we are interested in applying this framework to the reverse engineering problem in computational systems biology, which yields very large mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) problems. In particular, we consider the framework of logic-based ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Methods We present saCeSS2, a parallel method for the solution of this class of problems. This method is based on an parallel cooperative scatter search metaheuristic, with new mechanisms of self-adaptation and specific extensions to handle large mixed-integer problems. We have paid special attention to the avoidance of convergence stagnation using adaptive cooperation strategies tailored to this class of problems. Results We illustrate its performance with a set of three very challenging case studies from the domain of dynamic modelling of cell signaling. The simpler case study considers a synthetic signaling pathway and has 84 continuous and 34 binary decision variables. A second case study considers the dynamic modeling of signaling in liver cancer using high-throughput data, and has 135 continuous and 109 binaries decision variables. The third case study is an extremely difficult problem related with breast cancer, involving 690 continuous and 138 binary decision variables. We report computational results obtained in different infrastructures, including a local cluster, a large supercomputer and a public cloud platform. Interestingly, the results show how the cooperation of individual parallel searches modifies the systemic properties of the sequential algorithm, achieving superlinear speedups compared to an individual search (e.g. speedups of 15 with 10 cores), and significantly improving (above a 60%) the performance with respect to a non-cooperative parallel scheme. The scalability of the method is also good (tests were performed using up to 300 cores). Conclusions These results demonstrate that saCeSS2 can be used to successfully reverse engineer large dynamic models of complex biological pathways. Further, these results open up new possibilities for other MIDO-based large-scale applications in the life sciences such as metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, drug scheduling.

One challenging task is to establish an accurate mixed-variable metamodel. It is critical to reduce the prediction error of the mixed-variable metamodel in order to achieve a feasible design with superior performance in the metamodel-based optimization. This paper investigates two different strategies of mixed-variable metamodeling: "feature separating" strategy and "all-in-one" strategy. A supervised learning-aided method is proposed to improve the "feature separating" metamodels. The proposed method is compared with several existing mixed-variable metamodeling methods on three engineering benchmark problems to understand their relative merits. These methods include Neural Network (NN) regression, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Gaussian Process (GP). A new Polynomial Coefficient Metric is developed to quantify the adequacy of training data. This study provides insight and guidance for establishing proper metamodels on multi-material structural design problems.																					978-0-7918-5011-4				2016							239	251	UNSP V02BT03A021															WOS:000393363400021

Unlike in most previous studies, the proposed framework is more general, in which both symmetric and asymmetric user equilibria can be captured. By applying the complementarity slackness condition of the lower-level problem, the original bilevel formulation can be converted into a single-level and smooth nonlinear programming problem. In order to solve the problem, a relaxation scheme is applied by progressively restricting the complementarity condition, which has been proven to be a rigorous approach under certain conditions. The model and solution algorithm are tested for well-known network design problems and promising results are shown. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The neural architecture search (NAS) methods are employed for DNN model optimization with mixed-bitwidth networks. To satisfy the computation requirements, mixed-bitwidth convolution accelerators are highly desired for low-power and high-throughput performance. There exist several methods to support mixed-bitwidth multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations in DNN accelerator designs. The low-bitwidthcombination (LBC) method improves the low-bitwidth throughput with a large hardware cost. The high-bitwidth-split (HBS) method minimizes the additional logic gates for configuration. However, the throughput performance in the low-bitwidth mode is poor. In this work, a bit-split-and-combination (BSC) systolic accelerator is proposed. The BSC-based MAC unit is designed to support mixed-bitwidth operations with the best overall performance. Besides, interprocessing element (PE) systolic and intra-PE paralleled dataflow not only improves throughput performance in mixed-bitwidth modes, but also saves power performance for data transmission.

The purpose of this study is to design the controller with less constraints, which is convenient for successful applications of memristor-based recurrent neural networks in complex environment. First, the estimate of the disturbance and mixed time delay are given by the assumptions. Then, by the method of Lyapunov-Krasovski functional, two new criteria ensuring globally exponential stabilization of the neural network are obtained under the controller, respectively. The proposed theoretical results indicate that the control width and control period are not constrained except that the control width has an upper bound. Furthermore, the design algorithm of controller is described. Finally, two examples are performed through four neural networks to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

The nonlinear systems are modelled by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, and network induced delays between sensors and controllers are modelled by a finite state Markov process. The fuzzy controller's membership functions are allowed to be different from the plant's membership functions, and also the controller's premise variables are allowed to be the delayed plant's premise variables to accommodate the fact that the plant's premise variables are transmitted via the network. To reduce the conservatism of the controller design, the membership functions of the plant and the fuzzy controller are incorporated into the controller design. Based on the Sum Of Square (SOS) approach, sufficient conditions for the existence of the controller are derived in terms of SOS inequalities, which are then solved by YALMIP. Comparisons between the proposed design methodology and the existing controller designs are made using a numerical example. (C) 2014 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It starts from a review of recent developments in the area of robust estimators and observers for non-linear discrete-time systems and proposes less restrictive procedure for designing a neural network-based 96 observer. The proposed approach guaranties a predefined disturbance attenuation level and convergence of the observer, as well as unknown input decoupling and state and actuator fault estimation. The main advantage of the design procedure is its simplicity. The paper presents an observer design procedure that is reduced to solving a set of linear matrix inequalities.

Unlike some existing results, a novel polynomial event-triggered mechanism (PETM) is introduced to reduce the network resource occupancy. Moreover, the resultant event-triggered conditions are checked only at each sampling instant. A polynomial fault detection filter (PFDF), whose membership functions (MFs) and fuzzy rules are different from the considered PFMB systems, is designed to ensure the augmented PFMB fault detection system is asymptotically stable with H-infinity performance. The communication delay in communication network transmission is also considered. By adopting an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional, the sum of square (SOS)-based design conditions are less conservative and time-delay dependent. Two examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A novel neural network model named as standard neural network model (SNNM) with uncertainty is advanced for describing this class of approximating neural networks with biases. And a state-feedback control law is designed for the SNNM with real parametric uncertainty, such that L, gain of the closed-loop system is minimal. The approach is based on the robust L-2 gain (i.e. robust H-infinity performance) analysis of the Lure system using the common Lyopunov approach. The control design equations are shown to be a set of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) which can be solved by an improved iterative algorithm. Finally, a detailed design procedure of the control law for the nonlinear system is provided.																			1062-922X		0-7803-8566-7				2004							5876	5881																WOS:000226863300989

For this, thirty mix proportions and the related diffusion coefficients in high performance concrete are analyzed and fitness function for diffusion coefficient is obtained considering mix components like w/b (water to binder ratio), cement content, mineral admixture (slag, flay ash and silica fume) content, sand and coarse aggregate content. Through averaging the results of 10 times GA simulations, relative errors to the previous data decrease lower than 5.0% and the simulated mix proportions are verified with the experimental results. Assuming the durability design parameters, intended diffusion coefficient for intended service life is derived and mix proportions satisfying the service life are obtained. Among the mix proportions, the most optimized case which satisfies required concrete strength and the lowest cost is selected through GA algorithm. The proposed technique would be improved with the enhancement of comprehensive data set including wider the range of diffusion coefficients.																			1598-8198					DEC	2012	10	6					587	607																WOS:000311134300003

The action network is designed by a single input fuzzy-rules emulated network with the set of IF-THEN rules utilized by the relation between control effort and plant's output such as IF the output is high THEN the control effort should be reduced. The critic network is constructed by a multi-input FREN (MiFREN) for estimating an unknown long-term cost function. The set of IF-THEN rules for MiFREN is defined by the general knowledge of optimization such that IF the quadratic values of control effort and tracking error are high THEN the cost function should be high.

First, we give a general matrix decomposition approach which is applicable to scenarios where the system matrix A$A$ contains complex-value eigenvalues. Then, a discrete stochastic framework is established for a class of networked systems which considers the joint effects of sampling errors and two-channel deception attacks. Utilizing the matrix decomposition approach introduced in this study, it becomes feasible to decouple the expectation operations for specific coupling matrices characterized by substantial nonlinearity and randomness. Based on this, a stabilization controller is constructed that ensures the exponential mean-square stability of the resulting discrete stochastic system.

In Norway, a new programme called "Holistic Continuity of Patient Care" (HCPC) addresses the issue of multi-morbidity by providing integrated care within learning networks for frail elderly patients who receive municipal home care services or a short-term stay in a nursing home. This study conducts a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate whether the HCPC programme performs better on a large set of outcomes corresponding to the 'triple aim' compared to usual care. Methods Prospective longitudinal survey data were collected at baseline and follow-up after 6-months. The assessment of HCPC was implemented by a novel MCDA framework. The relative weights of importance of the outcomes used in the MCDA were obtained from a discrete choice experiment among five different groups of stakeholders. The performance score was estimated using a quasi-experimental design and linear mixed methods. Performance scores were standardized and multiplied by their weights of importance to obtain the overall MCDA value by stakeholder group. Results At baseline in the HCPC and usual care groups, respectively, 120 and 89 patients responded, of whom 87 and 41 responded at follow-up. The average age at baseline was 80.0 years for HCPC and 83.6 for usual care. Matching reduced the standardized differences between the groups for patient background characteristics and outcome variables. The MCDA results indicated that HCPC was preferred to usual care irrespective of stakeholders. The better performance of HCPC was mostly driven by improvements in enjoyment of life, psychological well-being, and social relationships and participation. Results were consistent with sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation. Conclusion Frail elderly with multi-morbidity represent complex health problems at large costs for society in terms of health- and social care. This study is a novel contribution to assessing and understanding HCPC programme performance respecting the multi-dimensionality of desired outcomes. Integrated care programmes like HCPC may improve well-being of patients, be cost-saving, and contribute to the pursuit of evidence based gradual reforms in the care of frail elderly.						Islam, M.

Several kinds of Gait estimation methods have been proposed, however, the previously proposed methods were mainly aiming at one kind of walking task, e.g., level ground walking. There are only a few studies aiming at continuous gait phase estimation during continuous multilocomotion tasks. In this article, we design a continuous gait phase estimator based on adaptive oscillator (AO) network. In order to overcome the problem that the traditional AO does not converge or converges slowly when the gait task is switching, a new structure of gait phase estimator, including a gait tasks classifier, an AO reset, a peak detector, and a model-based (MB) transition gait phase estimator is designed to improve the performance of AOs network. The switching unit is designed to reorganize the output gait phase. Considering the stabilization of the sensors in continuous multilocomotion tasks, the gait tasks classifier only utilizes the angle of hip joints. The results show that the constructed classifier has similar performance to other gait tasks classifiers and requires minimum sensing sources. The continuous gait phase estimation results during continuous multilocomotion tasks show that the proposed method has better performance than the traditional AO and the AO network with self-designed reset.					wu, xinyu/KRQ-4615-2024; wang, lina/HGC-1592-2022	Li, Nan/0000-0003-4407-934X; ma, yue/0000-0003-0828-8371													2379-8920	2379-8939				MAR	2021	13	1					45	56		10.1109/TCDS.2019.2933648	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2019.2933648													WOS:000628911300005

Event-triggered state estimation for nonlinear systems aid by machine learning	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												The event-triggered state estimation problem with the aid of machine learning for nonlinear systems is considered in this paper. First, we develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to predict the nonlinear systems.

This discrete-time dynamic event-triggered state observer significantly reduces the utilization of communication resources.

Multicommodity network design with discrete node costs	NETWORKS					Optimization 2004 Conference	JUL 25-28, 2004	Univ Lisbon, Lisbon, PORTUGAL	APDIO, CIO	Univ Lisbon			Although there is an extensive literature dealing with network design, little attention has been devoted to networks with complicated node costs. Although node costs, depending linearly on the total passing flow, can be easily embedded into the more usual framework of networks with link costs, when the node costs are, for instance, a stepwise function of the facilities installed into the nodes, this is no longer possible. This feature seems to be crucial in modern telecommunications networks, but has also applications in other fields, where a limited set of technologies is available with discrete values of capacities and costs. In our specific application, we propose a mathematical programming model that explicitly accounts for node costs that are stepwise with nonlinear increments. Two families of valid inequalities are then introduced, one of which is an extension of those presented in a previous work by Stoer and Dahl for multifacility network models. As the separation problem for these inequalities is difficult, we develop a heuristic separation procedure. We devise a branch-and-cut method and test it on a set of real-world instances found in the network design literature. This new method proves to be efficient when compared to a commercial general purpose MIP algorithm. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Peng, K				Peng, Kun			Attack and Correction: How to Design a Secure and Efficient Mix Network	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS												Shuffling is an effective method to build a publicly verifiable mix network to implement verifiable anonymous channels that can be used for important cryptographic applications like electronic voting and electronic cash. One shuffling scheme by Groth is claimed to be secure and efficient. However, its soundness has not been formally proven. An attack against the soundness of this shuffling scheme is presented in this paper. Such an attack compromises the soundness of the mix network based on it. Two new shuffling protocols are designed on the basis of Groth's shuffling and batch verification techniques. The first new protocol is not completely sound, but is formally analyzed in regards to soundness, so it can be applied to build a mix network with formally proven soundness. The second new protocol is completely sound, so is more convenient to apply. Formal analysis in this paper guarantees that both new shuffling protocols can be employed to build mix networks with formally provable soundness. Both protocols prevent the attack against soundness in Groth's scheme. Both new shuffling protocols are very efficient as batch-verification-based efficiency-improving mechanisms have been adopted. The second protocol is even simpler and more elegant than the first one as it is based on a novel batch cryptographic technique.																			1976-913X	2092-805X				MAR	2012	8	1					175	190		10.3745/JIPS.2012.8.1.175	http://dx.doi.org/10.3745/JIPS.2012.8.1.175													WOS:000420348700011

By using an augmented state-space method, this class of problem can be modeled as a discrete-time jump linear system governed by finite-state Markov chains. As the network-induced time vary delay of NCSs changes along with the network transferring route and the network load, results in systems becoming instable with controller designs based on a fixed transition matrix, we firstly make use of the V-K iteration algorithm to design in groups of stabilizing controllers that satisfy different in transition matrixes, and then constitute a switched controller for them and a switch. The simulation shows that if the switched controller is used to stabilize the discrete-time jump linear system, this system not only has a larger stabilizing span, but also has better dynamic stabilizing characters compared to those with only one group of controllers.					huang, jian/JMR-4475-2023; Huang, Jian/I-8521-2014	Huang, Jian/0000-0002-6267-8824; Chunxi, Yang/0000-0003-4455-6919													1561-8625	1934-6093				MAR	2011	13	2					255	264		10.1002/asjc.280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asjc.280													WOS:000288845400004

The MSDPA comprises one analog power amplifier (PA) as the main PA and one binary-weighted digital PA as the auxiliary PA. The MSDPA input is a generic envelope-varying complex-modulated signal. Based on the real-time amplitude-modulated (AM) envelope, auxiliary digital PA weightings are dynamically turned-on to perform optimum Doherty load modulation for superior linearity and back-off efficiency. Moreover, quantization noise is largely suppressed by the mixed-signal Doherty operation and nonuniform quantization (NUQ), while spectral images are substantially reduced by the quasi-first-order hold (quasi-FOH) operation, which together achieves super-resolution over conventional digital PAs; this makes the MSDPA conducive to millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) or compound PA designs by obviating the need for a large effective number of bits (ENOB) on AM digital controls. As a proof of concept, a 3-bit MSDPA is implemented at 27 GHz in a 45-nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS process. The prototype PA achieves 40.1% peak power-added efficiency (PAE), 23.3-dBm saturated output power (P-sat), and 39.4% PAE for 22.4-dBm P-1dB at 27 GHz in continuous-wave (CW) measurements. The PAE at 6-dB power back-off (PBO) is 33.1%, which corresponds to a 1.68x improvement over a normalized Class-B PA. With only three control bits, the MSDPA PA supports a 12-Gb/s 64-QAM signal at -24.5-dB rms error vector magnitude (EVM) and average P-out/PAE of +15.6 dBm/27.8% without digital pre-distortion (DPD).

Extended dissipative synchronization for discrete complex dynamical networks with random successive coupling delays through PID control	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												This work investigates the synchronization problem for a kind of discrete complex dynamical networks (CDNs) including nonlinearities, exogenous disturbance, and successive time-varying random coupling delays. Also, the stochastic variable obeying Bernoulli distribution is exploited to describe the randomness of the coupling delays. The main target of this work is to devise a novel PID controller ensuring that the proposed network is asymptotically synchronized in mean-square and also meets a specified extended dissipative performance. With the aid of Kronecker product properties, Lyapunov stability theory and free weighting matrix technique, less conservative sufficient criteria is obtained in the form of Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to affirm the synchronization of the considered network. At last, the efficacy and potency of the designed control protocol are verified through two examples including the Chen system.

In order to reduce the utilization of limited network bandwidth, a dynamic discrete event-triggered scheme to choose the transmitted data is designed. A Markovian jump time-delay system model is employed to describe the event-triggered scheme and the network related behavior, such as transmission delay, data package dropout, and disorder. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee that the resulting closed-loop system is stable and has a prescribed performance index. A co-design method for the H controller and the event-triggered scheme is then proposed. The effectiveness and potential of the theoretic results obtained are illustrated by a simulation example.

In this paper, we focus on the SRAM-based Non-Uniform Cache Architecture (NUCA) for 3D Multi-core Network-on-Chip (McNoC) systems. A tightly mixed SRAM NUCA for 3D mesh NoC is presented and analyzed. We evaluate the performance and network power with benchmarks based on a full system simulation framework. Experiment results on 16-core 3D NoC systems show that the tightly mixed NUCA could provide up to 31.71% and on average 5.95% performance improvement compared to a base 3D NUCA scheme. The tightly mixed 3D NUCA NoC can reduce network power consumption in 1.07%-15.74% and 9.64% on average compared to a baseline 3D NoCs. Our analysis and experimental results provide a guideline to design efficient 3D NoCs with stacking NUCA.

J	Ma, SB; Kim, KY				Ma, Sang-Bum; Kim, Kwang-Yong			Stability enhancement of a centrifugal compressor using inclined discrete cavities	AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Inclined discrete cavities are proposed to improve the operating stability of a centrifugal compressor while minimizing the flow loss, and optimized to simultaneously maximize the adiabatic efficiency and stall margin. Aerodynamic analysis was performed using three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier- Stokes equations. The numerical results obtained for the total pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency were validated with experimental data for the centrifugal compressor with a smooth casing. The angle of the cavity port, axial distance between cavities, and inclined angle of the cavity were selected as design variables based on sensitivity analysis. The stall margin and adiabatic efficiency at the design point were used as the objective functions for the design. Latin hypercube sampling was used to select 24 design points in the design space. Two neural network models, that is, the radial basis and deep neural networks, were tested with respect to surrogate models and their performances were compared using statistical analysis. A hybrid PSO-GA algorithm was used to identify the optimal solutions for the surrogate models. The deep neural network model has a better overall performance than the radial basis neural network model. The optimization results show that the stall margin increases, with increments of up to 6.41% and 11.32% compared with the reference design and compressor with a smooth casing, respectively.

However, popular simulators, such as ns and PlanetLab can't meet the scale and performance requirement of overlay research. Although it is necessary for overlay researchers to observe activities of million nodes, current simulators can not give such simulation result. To improve the overlay network research efficiency, we design and implement ONSP, a novel parallel overlay network simulation platform, which provides parallel discrete event simulation of overlay networks on high performance cluster. With this tool, we are able to build overlay network simulator in large scale easily and test it in short time. The test result proves that ONSP can well address the requirement of performance and scalability.

More specifically, the control goal is to design a set of state feedback gains together with a state dependent switching function assuring stability and H-2, H-infinity performance indexes. The conditions are based on Lyapunov or Riccati-Metzler inequalities which although are difficult to solve for a large number of subsystems, allow the derivation of simpler alternative conditions expressed by LMIs whenever a scalar variable is fixed. This theory is well adapted to treat an important networked control problem known as discrete-time self-triggered control design problem, where the switching rule is responsible for the scheduling of the sampling periods to be considered in the communication channel at each sampling time instant in order to improve performance. This method is compared theoretically with others from literature. Academical examples are used for comparisons and to show the validity of the proposed technique in both contexts, switched and networked control systems.

A multi-channel wide-kernel wavelet convolutional neural network is proposed to address these issues. Firstly, a first layer of multi-channel wide-kernel convolution is designed to fuse different weight information and suppress high-frequency noise. Secondly, a discrete wavelet transform block is designed to retain the low-frequency components of the discrete wavelet transform for signal denoising and feature dimension reduction. At the same time, Improved Balance Dynamic Adaptive Threshold is used to enhance the robustness of the model's noise and the sparsity of features, making the model easier to optimize. Lastly, a power spectrum and normalized class activation mapping are designed to validate the post-hoc explanations of the model. The effectiveness and reliability of the Multi-Channel Wide Kernel Wavelet Convolutional Neural Network are verified through two gearbox datasets.

This optimization problem has three constraints. Hydraulic constraints are the conservation of the mass in the nodes, the conservation of the energy in the circuits, and the minimum pressure at consumer nodes. The comercial constraint corresponds to pipe diameters that only asume discrete values in the market. Therefore, given the layout of the network and the demands on consumer nodes the goal is to design a network where the combination of pipe diameters minimize the constructive cost of the system. This paper presents the use of hybrid metaheuristics and handling of constraints with penalty functions for the optimization of the proposed problem, obtaining very good results in the network of Aperovits and Shamir and the network of New York. In addition, it shows details of the algorithms and results obtained.

An international team of academic institutes and industrial partners has cooperated to understand the chemistry occurring during the hydrothermal synthesis and crystallization of the M1 phase of the MoVTeNb mixed oxide. With this information, the optimization of this catalyst system could be targeted with the aim of improving catalyst performance for short chain alkane - ethane and propane oxidation reactions. Beside the elements responsible for the formation of the M1 phase (Mo, V, Te, and Nb) and promoters found to be advantageous in our previous work (Mn, Ni, W and citric acid), the following components were added to the synthesis mixture: Ce, Cu, Co, Cr and ethylene glycol. Contrary to the previous approach in this study, the V/Mo, Te/Mo and Nb/Mo ratios were kept constant. Consequently, the experimental space had nine variables. The discrete levels of variables are established in such a way that the number of the potential experimental points in the multi-dimensional experimental space was in the range of 200 000. Five new generations were designed using an optimization platform consisting of holographic optimization algorithm and artificial neural networks. Altogether 250 catalysts were prepared and tested. A complex objective function was created consisting of two independent catalytic performance characteristics - conversion and product selectivity - as well as the expected production costs and prices of the target product acrylic acid (AA) and export steam. The AA production costs were estimated assuming a recycle scheme for such a future AA plant with standard downstream equipment. The best catalysts in the group of catalysts with low vanadium content gave acrylic acid yields of 58% in the high throughput tests after five generations. On the bases of holographic maps, correlations between the composition of the synthesis mixtures and the yields of AA were visualized allowing to see the cross effect between components. Mn and Co had a positive effect, while Cu and Ce resulted in negative effect on the yield of AA. The analysis of the correlation between conversions vs. product yields allowed figuring out the main reaction routes leading to acrylic acid and CO2 in a consecutive reaction scheme. Following this successful high throughput development, the hydrothermal method using the newly identified synthesis aids was further optimized and successfully scaled up to 40 l autoclaves using the cheapest available chemicals, the oxides. This now renders possible the large-scale production of that complex MoVNbTe mixed oxide catalyst.

Development of alternative eco-friendly or multipurpose materials has conditioned improvements in concrete mix design to optimize concrete production speed and price, as well as carbon footprint. Artificial neural networks represent a new and efficient tool in achieving optimal concrete mixtures according to its intended function. This paper addresses concrete mix design and the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for self-sensing concrete. The authors review concrete mix design methods and the development of ANNs for prediction of properties for various types of concrete. Furthermore, the authors present developments and applications of ANNs for prediction of compressive strength and flexural strength of carbon nanotubes/carbon nanofibers (CNT/CNF) reinforced concrete using experimental results for the learning process. The goal is to bring the ANN approach closer to a variety of concrete researchers and possibly propose the implementation of ANNs in the civil engineering practice.

Under the assumption that the measurements are not time stamped, a new measurement model is presented to describe the measured data subject to random delays which are caused by the transmission between the sensor and the observer. Then the observer-based controller is designed by solving a linear matrix inequality. Our design guarantees the exponentially mean-square stability of the closed-loop system and satisfies the prescribed H-infinity performance.

Our work has been motivated by the Wireless Control Network (WCN) architecture, where the network itself behaves as a distributed, structured dynamical compensator. We make connections to model reduction theory to derive a method for the controller embedding based on minimization of the H-infinity-norm of the error system. This allows us to frame the problem as synthesis of optimal structured linear controllers, which enables the utilization of design-time iterative procedures for systems' approximation. Finally, we illustrate the use of the mapping procedure by embedding PID controllers into the WCN substrate, and show how to reduce the computation overhead of the approximation procedure.

A new model is proposed as the filtering error system to simultaneously capture the communication constraint, random packet dropout and quantization effects in the networked systems. A sufficient condition is presented for the filtering error system to be mean square exponentially stable with a prescribed Hoc performance by employing the multiple Lyapunov function method. The obtained condition depends on some parameters of the networked systems, such as the access sequence of nodes, packet dropout rate and quantization density. With these parameters fixed, a design procedure for the desired Ho filter is also presented based on the derived condition.

Fuzzy polynomial neural networks for approximation of the compressive strength of concrete	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												The main purpose of this paper is to develop fuzzy polynomial neural networks (FPNN) to predict the compressive strength of concrete. Two different architectures of FPNN are addressed (Type1 and Type2) and their training methods are discussed. In this research, the proposed FPNN is a combination of fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) and polynomial neural networks (PNNs). Here, while the FNN demonstrates the premises (If-Part) of the fuzzy model, the PNN is implemented as its consequence (Then-Part). To enhance the performance of the network, back propagation (BP), and list square error (LSE) algorithms are utilized for the tuning of the system. Six different FPNN architectures are constructed, trained, and tested using the experimental data of 458 different concrete mix-designs collected from three distinct sources. The data are organized in a format of six input parameters of concrete ingredients and one output as 28-day compressive strength of the mix-design. Using root means square (RMS) and correlation factors (CFs), the models are evaluated and compared with training and testing data pairs. The results show that FPNN-Type1 has strong potential as a feasible tool for prediction of the compressive strength of concrete mix-design. However, the FPNN-Type2 is recognized as unfeasible model to this purpose. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The values of connection matrix and the bias currents are then calculated by means of ray tracing. They are applied to update the neuron asynchronously and randomly, until the valid solutions are achieved. 21 recommended Chinese optical glasses are selected to form a small catalog for the neural network model to reduce the number of the neurons and increase the convergence rate of optimization.

First, by discrete-time approach, we establish a discrete-time unified framework. Then, an equivalent stochastic model is constructed in virtue of matrix exponential computation, where the system matrix is characterized by high nonlinearity and randomness with respect to the number of consecutive packet dropouts, which poses difficulties for the expectation operation of a nonlinear and random coupling term in the analysis of the resulting stochastic system. In order to deal with the difficulties, the law of total expectation, confluent Vandermonde matrix and Kronecker product operation are used and then a stabilization controller is designed such that the stochastic stability of the closed-loop stochastic system is guaranteed.

How Does a Junior Faculty Development Program Affect Burnout? A Mixed Methods Assessment	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT												OBJECTIVES Burnout is common among junior faculty. Professional development has been proposed as a method to improve engagement and reduce burnout among academic physicians. The Penn State College of Medicine Junior Faculty Development Program (JFDP) is a well-established, interdisciplinary program. However, an increase in burnout was noted among participants during the program. The authors sought to quantify the change in burnout seen among JFDP participants across 3 cohorts, and to explore sources of well-being and burnout among participants.METHODS Through a sequential explanatory mixed methods approach, participants in the 2018/19, 2019/20, and 2020/21 cohorts took a survey assessing burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), quality of life (QoL), job satisfaction, and work-home conflict at the start and end of the course. Descriptive statistics were generated as well as Pearson chi 2 test/Fisher exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables for group comparisons. To better understand the outcome, past participants were invited to interviews regarding their experience of burnout during the course. Inductive thematic analysis (kappa = 0.86) was used to derive themes.RESULTS Start- and end-of-course surveys were completed by 84 and 75 participants, respectively (response rates: 95.5% and 85.2%). Burnout associated with patient/learner/client/colleague increased (P = .005) and QoL decreased (P = .02) at the end compared with the start. Nonsignificant trends toward worsening in other burnout categories, work-home conflict, and job satisfaction were also observed. Nineteen interviews yielded themes related to risks and protective factors for burnout including competing demands, benefits of networking, professional growth, and challenges related to diverse faculty roles.CONCLUSION Junior Faculty Development Program participants demonstrated worsening of burnout and QoL during the program while benefiting from opportunities including skill building and networking. The impact of Junior Faculty Development Programs on the well-being of participants should be considered as an element of their design, evaluation, and refinement over time.																			2382-1205						2024	11								23821205231223294	10.1177/23821205231223294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23821205231223294								38322705					WOS:001156952900001

In this study, memristors were set to ternary and quaternary states in a sub-cell by application of different write voltage levels through a resistive network configuration. Simulations of the proposed circuit show that the highest number of discrete output levels of the memory was achieved using quaternary logic. However overall, using the same number of sub-cells and ternary logic exhibits the lowest relative error rate. For data classification purposes, the proposed discrete-level memristive cells are incorporated into the TM of HTM architecture, and its hardware circuit is presented for pattern recognition. They report improved results of face recognition using AR, ORL and UFI databases, and TIMIT database for speech recognition. These results are compared with the earlier design of HTM having only the spatial pooler (SP). Accuracy of the HTM architecture incorporating both SP and TM with discrete-level memristive cells for face recognition increased from 76.5 to 83.5% for AR database and speech recognition accuracy is improved from 73.3 to 93.3%.

The connectivity of the mobile user to the core network via an active set of access points is determined dynamically by the handoff algorithm via measurements of received pilot signal strengths. Using a discrete-time framework, we derive analytical expressions and develop associated numerical procedures for evaluating the soft handoff performance of a mobile unit travelling along an arbitrary straight-line trajectory in a CDMA cellular network. In particular, we obtain expressions for the cell assignment probabilities, which can be used to compute performance measures such as outage probability, macrodiversity gain, and signaling load. Our methodology provides an accurate and efficient means of designing and dimensioning high performance soft handoff algorithms for CDMA networks, while avoiding the need for approximations or time-consuming computer simulation.																					0-7803-7400-2				2002							3222	3226																WOS:000177818300615

The proposed method primarily involves three stage multi-objective (travel distance minimization, operational cost minimization, and psychological cost minimization), mixed-integer linear programming models. The three sub-networks are designed using the proposed programming models. The distinctive features of the proposed method are as follows. (1) The proposed method is demand-driven. The order of the designed sub-networks is shelter, medical, and distribution, with the connections of the latter networks based on the arrangements for the former. (2) The objective functions of three stage programming models include not only traditional objectives such as minimizing total travel distance and operational cost, which supply-side members focus on, but also minimizing the psychological cost experienced by demand-side members. Model tests are conducted to demonstrate that the superiority of a centralized emergency supply network designed by the proposed method over a decentralized one, especially with regard to distribution network design.

Novel synchronization of discrete-time chaotic systems using neural network observer	CHAOS												This paper presents a new approach to solve the synchronization problem of a large class of discrete chaotic systems. The chaotic systems can be reformulated as an appropriate class of linear parameter varying (LPV) systems.

The planification and design space exploration for 3D NoCs, intuitively harder than for 2D NoCs, calls for more flexible and powerful simulation tools. The Matlab ecosystem is appropriate for the implementation of such simulation systems. In this paper, we present the simulation of a model of a mesh 4x4x3 3D NoC using SimEvents, a Discrete Event Simulation accessible through Mathworks Simulink. The performance of the whole NoC is measured for the whole network, and for the side, corner, and middle nodes.																			2162-061X		978-1-4673-9994-4				2015							157	158																WOS:000380406600030

The aim is showing methodological aspects, variables analyzed, mathematical model proposed and the results obtained for the design of the distribution network. The proposed network allows increasing the level of customer service and reducing the logistic cost. Methodology for development of work focused on three phases: First, the analysis of variables that influence the operation of the company's distribution system. Second, a mixed integer linear programming (MIP) mathematical model was developed with the current distribution network and with the addition of new distribution centers. Finally, different scenarios were proposed to evaluate the variability and uncertainty of relevant variables of the system.

The action neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate unknown and desired control input signals, and the critic NNs are employed to estimate the cost function in the design procedure. Furthermore, the direct adaptive optimal controllers are designed by combining the backstepping technique with the reinforcement learning algorithm. Comparing the existing reinforcement learning algorithm, the computational burden can be effectively reduced by using the method of less learning parameters. The adaptive auxiliary signals are established to compensate for the influence of the dead zones and actuator faults on the control performance. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, some simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In this paper, we provide a formal specification of double-rings with dual attachments (DRDA) topologies of optical networks using Continuous-Time Markov Chains. Our formal modeling includes the concept of pre-configured protection cycles (p-cycles), which provide effective fault tolerance against link-failures in optical networks. Our approach is generic enough to handle networks of any size that are prone to any combinations of link failures. We formally specify several dependability properties using Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL). We then provide a quantitative evaluation of these properties using the PRISM model checker. We observe that such formal analysis can provide critical information at early design stages to network operators for designing highly-dependable optical networks in metropolitan areas (e.g., availability on the order of 99.99% or 99.999%).					johnson, taylor/GRX-4598-2022; Johnson, Taylor T/E-8862-2015	Johnson, Taylor T/0000-0001-8021-9923; Hoque, Khaza Anuarul/0000-0002-1625-6479													1530-1591		978-3-9815370-9-3				2017							1564	1569																WOS:000404171500291

The capacity of facilities is considered uncertain. In order to get closer to real-world situations, competition between SCs is considered.Design/methodology/approachA two-stage stochastic programming model is developed for designing the SC network. The location of facilities and selection of suppliers are considered first-stage decisions, and the determination of materials and products flows are second-stage decisions. Some resilience strategies are applied to mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions.FindingsThe results indicate that considering resilience and applying the related strategies are vitally important, and resilience strategies can significantly improve the SC objective and maintain market share. Also, it is confirmed that unrealistic decisions will be made without considering the competition.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature by proposing a novel mathematical model for the resilient mixed SCND problem. The other contribution is considering the chain-to-chain competition in collecting returned products and selling recycled products to other SCs in a mixed SC under disruptions. Also, a novel hybrid metaheuristic is developed to cope with the complexity of the model.

These conditions are used to develop a simultaneous design of controllers and protocols in terms of matrix inequalities.

The method is based on introducing the memory vectors as maximal independent sets to an undirected graph and on designing a dynamical network in order to find a maximal independent set whose characteristic vector is close to the given distorted vector. We show that our method provides the attractiveness for each memory vector and avoids the occurance of spurious states whenever the set of given memory vectors satisfies certain compatibility conditions. We also analyze the application of this design method to the discrete Hopfield network.																					0-7803-7150-X				2001							713	716																WOS:000175971700160

This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) based visualization method to optimize the concrete mix design. It aims to minimize the cost of concrete such that all desired qualities are maintained. The procedure can be described as mapping data of concrete mix from multidimensional space to a two-dimensional plane with an ANN model, and then generating concrete property contours on this plane. The optimized mix proportions region call be determined intuitively based on the contours distribution. By means of an inversion mapping algorithm the optimal point in this region can be mapped inversely to the original multidimensional space. Practical production test results show that good concrete mixes. which agree with the concrete compressive strength criterion and have lower cost, can be obtained. Application of this method call contribute significant benefits to the commercial concrete companies.																			0302-9743		978-3-642-01512-0				2009	5553						41	+																WOS:000268029200005

Distributed observer-based learning control strategies are proposed to solve the consensus tracking problem effectively when the state information of each node is unavailable. Meanwhile, distributed initial state learning strategies are designed to improve the tracking performances. Some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the asymptotical convergence of the consensus tracking error. It is interesting to find that the initial learning strategies play significant roles in the theoretical analysis. In the end, the effectiveness of obtained results is demonstrated by a simulation example.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				AUG 13	2020	14	12					1639	1647		10.1049/iet-cta.2019.1244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2019.1244													WOS:000555936800011

Limit surfaces, therefore, facilitate visual control by point estimations in systems design. This final of 3 papers deals with the design of concrete mixes on limit surfaces. The estimation and control of quality of two-phase models are used to generate limit surfaces for mix design. The limit surfaces are drawn on axes of free we and aggregate volume concentration (We, AgVol). There are intersecting networks of water, W and cement contents, C, so that all mix variables are at particular points on the limit surface. Using stable mix compositions, quality maps are classified for the strengths of concrete. A graphical hypothesis to detect and pre-determine concrete mix problems is advanced.																					978-0-415-47592-1				2009							21	26																WOS:000268842900004

J	Muralidhar, A; Kumar, PR				Muralidhar, Anand; Kumar, P. R.			Near-Optimal Quantization and Linear Network Coding for Relay Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY												We introduce a discrete network corresponding to any Gaussian wireless network that is obtained by simply quantizing the received signals and restricting the transmitted signals to a finite precision. Since signals in the discrete network are obtained from those of a Gaussian network, the Gaussian network can be operated on the quantization-based digital interface defined by the discrete network. We prove that this digital interface is near optimal for Gaussian relay networks and the capacities of the Gaussian and the discrete networks are within a bounded gap of O(M-2) bits, where M is the number of nodes. We also prove that any near-optimal coding strategy for the discrete network can be naturally transformed into a near-optimal coding strategy for the Gaussian network merely by quantization. We exploit this property by designing a linear coding strategy for the case of layered discrete relay networks. The linear coding strategy is near optimal and achieves all rates within O(M-2) bits of the capacity, independent of channel gains or signal-to-noise ratio. The linear code is therefore a near-optimal strategy for layered Gaussian relay networks and can be used as on the Gaussian network after simply quantizing the signals. The relays in the linear code need not know the channel gains on either the incoming or the outgoing links. The transmit and receive signals at all relays are simply quantized to binary tuples of the same length n, which is all that the nodes need to know. The linear network code is a particularly simple scheme and requires all the relay nodes to collect the received binary tuples into a long binary vector and apply a linear transformation on the long vector. The resulting binary vector is split into smaller binary tuples for transmission by the relays. The quantization requirements of the linear network code are completely defined by the parameter n, which therefore also determines the resolution of the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters that are required for operating the network within a bounded gap of the network's capacity. As evident from the description, the linear network code explicitly connects network coding for wireline networks with codes for Gaussian networks.

Discrete choice models are widely used to model patient preferences among treatment alternatives, but few studies have utilized this approach to investigate healthcare design alternatives. In the current study, respondents were asked to choose between hypothetical hospitals that differed in patient room design, window features of the room, appointment availability, distance from home, insurance coverage, and HCAHPS ratings. The results demonstrate that patient room design that allowed unobscured access to daylight and views through windows, in-network insurance coverage, closer distance from home, and one-star higher patient experience rating increased the likelihood of a patient's hospital choice. The study broadly explores discrete choice model's applicability to healthcare design and its ability to quantify patient perceptions with a metric meaningful for hospital administrators.

In this paper H-2, H-infinity, and mixed H-2/H-infinity based controllers are discussed for the delayed rate feedback problem. There is some transmission delay before the sources receive the feedback from the controller and adjust their rate. Controller design specifications for the system include fairness to multiple users, efficient utilization, and minimization of the queue size. However, the most important design specification is the robust stability in the presence of plant uncertainties and input disturbances. The performance of the designed controllers are tested by simulating a network.

Fault Detection and Isolation of discrete-time Markovian jump linear systems with application to a network of multi-agent systems having imperfect communication channels	AUTOMATICA					American Control Conference 2008	JUN 11-13, 2008	Seattle, WA	IEEE				This paper deals with the problem of Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) for discrete-time Markovian jump Linear Systems (MJLSs). A geometric property related to the unobservable subspace of an MJLS is first presented and the concept of unobservability subspace is introduced. Sufficient conditions for designing an H-infinity-based FDI algorithm for MJLSs subject to input disturbances and measurement noise are presented and developed. Our proposed approach is then applied to the problem of fault detection and isolation in a network of multi-agent systems when imperfect communication channels exist among the agents. A discrete-time communication link with a stochastic packet dropping effect is considered based on the Gilbert-Elliott model and the entire network is modeled as a discrete-time MJLS. Simulation results are presented for formation flight of satellites to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and performance capabilities of our proposed FDI algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To break the limitation of parameter selection and improve the quality of detecting communities in dynamic network further, a multiobjective discrete bat algorithm (MDBA) is proposed to detect community structure in dynamic networks in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, the bat location updating strategy is designed in discrete form. In addition, turbulence operation and mutation strategy are presented to guarantee the diversity of the population. The non-dominated sorting and crowding distance mechanism are used to keep good solutions during the generation.

Continuous Error Detection and Correction of Arithmetic in a Complement RRNS	2020 10TH ANNUAL COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION WORKSHOP AND CONFERENCE (CCWC)					10th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC)	JAN 06-08, 2020	Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, CA	IEEE Reg 1, IEEE Reg 6, IEEE USA, Inst Engn & Management, Univ Engn & Management, UNLV	Univ Nevada			A method for performing continuous error detection and correction of arithmetic is disclosed which utilizes a redundant residue number system (RRNS) and signed values encoded using the method of complements. Prior art methods for error correction in an RRNS operate on positive magnitudes only. Correction of negative values encoded using the method of complements of the full range of the RRNS representation has not been previously solved. This paper demonstrates the prior art using an example error correction of a positive result and explains why negative numbers present a problem for error correction of arithmetic. Next, two new solutions for direct correction of negative numbers encoded using the method of complements is disclosed. In the first method, two groups of trial digit sets are tested; one group for positive numbers and the other for negative numbers. A basic proof for the method is detailed which uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In a second method also disclosed, negative values are directly corrected along with positive numbers using a single pass hardware pipeline. The second method is developed formally and is followed with an example of a direct error correction of a negative value. Finally, details of a pipelined error detection and correction circuit is provided. Because of the carry free properties of the RRNS number system, and because of the new correction methods, an error in any digit may be corrected with equal success, even after lengthy product summation operations. The new error correction method provides continuous correction of arithmetic since the circuit designs are fully pipelined and can deliver a corrected result every clock cycle. The new error correction method is used to provide error correction to signed arithmetic using a standard method of complements encoding; this enables flexible error correction of general-purpose RNS arithmetic for advanced applications such as convolution neural network (CNN) and matrix arithmetic.																					978-1-7281-3783-4				2020							9	17	1570612552	10.1109/ccwc47524.2020.9031218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ccwc47524.2020.9031218													WOS:000668567200002

A mixed integer linear programming model has been provided in this study which, compared to previous models, considers issues such as capacity constraints and network planning issues. Moreover, the most important initiative of this article is entering two parameters: cost (non-profit) due to losing customers and expenditures of the unused capacity. These two parameters will help the model identify the best supply in each path. Various demand functions have been used in solving the model. Based on conducted analyses, using the expected value of monthly demand in comparison with high and low demand and seasonal changes in the network is optimized. The results of study also show that in times of high demand, the airline tends to aggregate passengers and increase density in hub paths.						khaksar, Hassan/0000-0003-0291-9128															978-0-7844-8258-2				2019							122	134																WOS:000568186100011

In order to handle the problem of causality contradiction, the original discrete-time nonlinear switched system is transformed into a special maximum n-step ahead predictor which suits the application of backstepping technique. The radial basis function(RBF) neural networks are adopted to approximate the unknown lumped function at the last step of backstepping procedure, not necessary to approximate all the virtual control laws at each intermediate step. Thus, the process of controller design is significantly simplified in contrast with the existing results. The stability analysis proves the proposed approach guarantees the semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded(SGUUB) of the closed-loop system, and the tracking error asymptotically converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of origin by appropriately designing control parameters. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.																			2169-3536						2021	9						9682	9689		10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3048379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3048379													WOS:000609790600001

Unlike the traditional NN-based discrete-time control, the weights are updated non-periodically and only at the trigger instants. The Lyapunov direct approach is utilized to arrive at an analytical condition referred to as event-trigger condition which guarantees the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the system states and NN weight estimation errors. This design not only reduces the network communication but also the computation due to non-periodic control execution and NN weight update. In addition, explicit knowledge of the system dynamics is not necessary for generating the control input. Finally simulation results corroborate the analytical claims.

J	Wen, BY; Zheng, XL				Wen, Bianying; Zheng, Xiaolei			Effect of the selective distribution of graphite nanoplatelets on the electrical and thermal conductivities of a polybutylene terephthalate/polycarbonate blend	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Controlling the functional filler selective distribution in a co-continuous polymer blend matrix is an effective way to achieve a high-performance functional composite with a relative lower filler loading. In this work, a polybutylene terephthalate/polycarbonate (PBT/PC) blend with good performance complementarity is selected as the host matrix, and graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) with excellent conductivity and a typical two-dimensional layered structure serve as the functional filler. PBT/PC/GNPs composites with different blend ratios were prepared by using a melting mix technique. The selective segregated distribution of filler in the polymer blend and the corresponding thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and mechanical properties of the PBT/PC/GNPs composites were systematically investigated. The migration mechanism of GNPs in the PBT/PC blend is also discussed based on the thermodynamic calculation prediction. Kinetic experimental results indicate that the morphology of the series of PBT/PC/GNPs composites changes with the proportion of PBT and PC. A co-continuous phase morphology formed at a 50:50 vol ratio of PBT/PC. Thermodynamic analysis showed that GNPs are more likely to be distributed in the PBT phase because the interfacial tension between PBT and GNPs is lower than that between PC and GNPs. The results of the kinetic experiments and selective etching experiment further confirmed the above prediction. The thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity of PBT/PC/GNPs composites have been effectively improved with the segregated distribution of GNPs in a co-continuous PBT/PC blend. Compared to a binary PBT or PC matrix composite, the electrical conductivity of PBT/PC/GNPs ternary composite filled with 3 vol% GNPs increased by eight orders of magnitude and the thermal conductivity increased by similar to 10% for the same content of GNPs. Simultaneously, the tensile strength of the PBT/PC/GNPs composite is 50 MPa, which maintains a high application value.																			0266-3538	1879-1050				APR 12	2019	174						68	75		10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.02.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.02.017													WOS:000469407500009

The authors design a polling network (system) in which each station is finite-buffered and is served according to a mixed service discipline and a general service order sequence. They first analyse the network by means of an imbedded Markov chain approach to obtain probability generating functions (PGFs) for the number of customers in stations at four observation points: customer-service beginning, customer-service ending, server's arrival, and server's departure. Two performance measures of mean waiting time and blocking probability are then derived. Finally, the authors search for an optimal pattern of the mixed service discipline and service order sequence for a polling network via a genetic algorithm. The results show that a polling network with an optimal pattern of mixed service discipline and service order sequence offers a great improvement in performance over a polling network with a unique service discipline and cyclic service order sequence; a polling network has different optimal patterns for different traffic intensities; and a near-optimal pattern could exist for all traffic loads.																			1350-2425					FEB	1995	142	1					1	6		10.1049/ip-com:19951537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/ip-com:19951537													WOS:A1995QK65200001

Our aim is to design a controller such that, though the unavoidable phenomena of time delay and external disturbances is fully considered, the resulting closed-loop system is stable with a mixed H-infinity and passive performance level. By combining sliding mode control and adaptive control methods, a novel adaptive sliding mode control strategy is designed for the synchronization of time-delayed FO dynamic networks. Via the application of FO system stability theory, the projective synchronization conditions are addressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Based on the conditions, a desired controller which can guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system and also ensure a mixed H-infinity and passive performance level is designed.

D-Optimal Design for Network A/B Testing	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL THEORY AND PRACTICE												A/B testing refers to the statistical procedure of experimental design and analysis to compare two treatments, A and B, applied to different testing subjects. It is widely used by technology companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Netflix, to compare different algorithms, web-designs, and other online products and services. The subjects participating in these online A/B testing experiments are users who are connected in different scales of social networks. Two connected subjects are similar in terms of their social behaviors, education and financial background, and other demographic aspects. Hence, it is only natural to assume that their reactions to online products and services are related to their network adjacency. In this paper, we propose to use the conditional auto-regressive model to present the network structure and include the network effects in the estimation and inference of the treatment effect. A D-optimal design criterion is developed based on the proposed model. Mixed integer programming formulations are developed to obtain the D-optimal designs.

Both randomly occurring sensor nonlinearity and missing measurements are taken into account to better reflect the reality of network environment. Meanwhile, a novel model is proposed to account for these two phenomena by using a Kronecker delta function. Different from the existing related work, Bernoulli distributed white sequences is abandoned in this paper. In this situation, a guaranteed cost output feedback control law is established such that the synchronization error system reaches asymptotic stability with a guaranteed cost value. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via a simulation example.

Bernoulli process is adopted to describe the randomly varying nonlinearities, and the norm-bounded uncertain model is used to deal with the sensor failures. Then, a set of sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee that the estimation error system is stochastically stable with the prescribed l2-l property. Then, using the linear matrix inequality method, the estimator gains are obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed new design method is illustrated through a numerical example.

A wavelet neural control scheme for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												Wavelets are designed to have compact support in both time and frequency, giving them the ability to represent a signal in the two-dimensional time-frequency plane. The Gaussian, the Mexican hat and the Morlet wavelets are crude wavelets that can be used only in continuous decomposition. The Morlet wavelet is complex-valued and suitable for feature extraction using the continuous wavelet transform. Continuous wavelets are favoured when high temporal and spectral resolution is required at all scales. In this paper, considering the properties from the Morlet wavelet and based on the structure of a recurrent high-order neural network model, a novel wavelet neural network structure, here called a recurrent Morlet wavelet neural network, is proposed in order to achieve a better identification of the behaviour of dynamic systems. The effectiveness of our proposal is explored through the design of a decentralized neural backstepping control scheme for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. The performance of the overall neural identification and control scheme is verified via simulation and real-time results. This article is part of the theme issue 'Redundancy rules: the continuous wavelet transform comes of age'.

One of the major challenges for virtual network mapping is the efficient allocation of substrate resources to the virtual networks. In order to further improve the efficiency of the previous algorithms in large scale network, the crossover operator is introduced into discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm, and a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed. The algorithm can solve the problem that the traditional particle swarm algorithm is easy to fall into local optimal point and is difficult to reach the global optimal. Experimental results show that the algorithm consumes the lowest cost in the case of mapping the same virtual network requests than existing ones, and has higher revenue/costs ratio.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-52015-5; 978-3-319-52014-8				2017	10135						527	536		10.1007/978-3-319-52015-5_54	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-52015-5_54													WOS:000418793000054

Towards the design of efficient accelerators, many works have adopted a dataflow-based, inter-layer pipelined architecture, with a customized hardware towards each layer, achieving ultra high throughput and low latency. The deployment of neural networks to such dataflow architecture accelerators is usually hindered by the available on-chip memory as it is desirable to preload the weights of neural networks on-chip to maximise the system performance. To address this, networks are usually compressed before the deployment through methods such as pruning, quantization and tensor decomposition. In this paper, a framework for mapping CNNs onto FPGAs based on a novel tensor decomposition method called Mixed-TD is proposed. The proposed method applies layer-specific Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) in a mixed manner, achieving 1.73x to 10.29x throughput per DSP to state-of-the-art CNNs.

A Mixed Methods Approach to Network Data Collection	FIELD METHODS												There is a growing interest in examining network processes with a mix of qualitative and quantitative network data. Research has consistently shown that free recall name generators entail recall bias and result in missing data that affect the quality of social network data. This study describes a mixed methods approach for collecting social network data, combining a free recall name generator in the context of an online survey with network relations data coded from transcripts of semistructured qualitative interviews. The combined network provides substantially more information about the network space, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Although network density was relatively stable across networks generated from different data collection methodologies, there were noticeable differences in centrality and component structure across networks. The approach presented here involved limited participant burden and generated more complete data than either technique alone could provide. We make suggestions for further development of this method.

This can overcome the limitation of anticlockwise trajectory of second-harmonic impedance on Smith chart. The approach starts with the design at intrinsic plane based on generic representation of drain voltage and current waveforms. Nonlinear embedding transfer network is then used to project intrinsic loads to the package plane. The proposed design strategy is verified with the implementation of a 15-W GaN HEMT-based PA operating over the frequency range of 1.5 to 2.5 GHz with drain efficiency between 60%-75%.

Different from traditional heuristic dynamic programming algorithms, the control law in this algorithm will only be updated when the triggering condition is satisfied to reduce the computational burden. Three neural networks are employed, which are model network, action network, and critic network. Model functions, control laws, and value functions are estimated using neural networks, respectively. The main contribution of this algorithm is the novel triggering condition with simpler form and fewer assumptions. Additionally, a proof of the stability for discrete-time systems using Lyapunov technique is given. Finally, two simulations are shown to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.

Next, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming model, factoring in ship-operating and container-handling costs.

Q.			Joint Communication and Computation Offloading for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency With Multi-Tier Computing	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS												In this paper, we study joint communication and computation offloading (JCCO) for hierarchical edge-cloud systems with ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC). We aim to minimize the end-to-end (e2e) latency of computational tasks among multiple industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices by jointly optimizing offloading probabilities, processing rates, user association policies and power control subject to their service delay and energy consumption requirements as well as queueing stability conditions. The formulated JCCO problem belongs to a difficult class of mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, making it computationally intractable. In addition, a strong coupling between binary and continuous variables and the large size of hierarchical edge-cloud systems make the problem even more challenging to solve optimally. To address these challenges, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems based on the unique structure of the underlying problem and leverage the alternating optimization (AO) approach to solve them in an iterative fashion by developing newly convex approximate functions. To speed up optimal user association searching, we incorporate a penalty function into the objective function to resolve uncertainties of a binary nature. Two sub-optimal designs for given user association policies based on channel conditions and random user associations are also investigated to serve as state-of-the-art benchmarks. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of the e2e latency and convergence speed.

It was verified that the five parameters and the mix proportion of concrete can be transformed each other when Modified Tourfar's Model is applied. The behaviors (strength, Slump, et al.) of concrete primarily determined by the mix proportion of concrete now depend on the five parameters. The prediction models of strength and slump of concrete were built based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). The calculation models of average paste thickness and equivalent water-cement ratio can be obtained by the reversal deduction of the two prediction models, respectively. A concrete mix proportion design algorithm based on a way from aggregates to paste, a least paste content, Modified Tourfar's Model and ANNs was proposed. The proposed concrete mix proportion design algorithm is expected to reduce the number of trial and error, save cost, laborers and time. The concrete designed by the proposed algorithm is expected to have lower cement and water contents, higher durability, better economical and ecological effects. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Guo, KP; Zhang, N; Smith, R				Guo, Kunpeng; Zhang, Nan; Smith, Robin			Design optimisation of multi-stream plate fin heat exchangers with multiple fin types	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING												For multi-stream plate fin heat exchanger design, one needs to consider the optimal combination of fin categories and detailed geometries of fin types. Due to the complexity of the design problem for multi stream plate fin heat exchangers, a major limitation of existing technology is the lack of a general design methodology that can consider mix-and-match fin type selection and imposed constraints simultaneously to take advantage of different fin characteristics. In this work, a new design method is proposed to consider the possibility of mix-and-match fin types. Multi-stream plate fin heat exchangers with mix-and-match fin types is considered as a network of two-stream plate fin heat exchangers. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is converted into a nonlinear programming (NLP) model, and solved in combination of enumeration for a few remaining binary variables. The objective is to minimise the total capital cost. Case studies are carried out to validate the effectiveness of new proposed design methodology and demonstrate the benefits of mix-and-match fin type combinations in the overall design methodology.

PSO-based algorithm for home care worker scheduling in the UK	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING												This paper presents the novel application of a collaborative population-based meta-heuristic technique called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to the scheduling of home care workers. The technique is applied to a genuine situation arising in the UK, where the provision of community care service is a responsibility of the local authorities. Within this provision, optimization routes for each care worker are determined in order to minimize the distance traveled providing that the capacity and service time window constraints are not violated. The objectives of this paper are twofold; first to exploit a systematic approach to improve the existing schedule of home care workers, second to develop the methodology to enable the continuous PSO algorithm to be efficiently applied to this type of problem and all classes of similar problems. For this problem, a particle is defined as a multi-dimensional point in space which represents the corresponding care activities and assignment priority. The Heuristic Assignment scheme is specially designed to transform the continuous PSO algorithm to the discrete job schedule. The Earliest Start Time Priority with Minimum Distance Assignment (ESTPMDA) technique is developed for generating an initial solution which guides the search direction of the particle. Local improvement procedures (LIP), i.e. insertion and swap, are embedded in the PSO algorithm in order to further improve the solution quality. The proposed methodology is implemented, tested, and compared with existing solutions on a variety of real problem instances. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While it concentrates on building evacuation many of the results are applicable also to regional evacuation. All models consider the time as main parameter, where the travel time between components of the building is part of the input and the overall evacuation time is the output. The paper distinguishes between macroscopic and microscopic evacuation models both of which are able to capture the evacuees' movement over time. Macroscopic models are mainly used to produce good lower bounds for the evacuation time and do not consider any individual behavior during the emergency situation. These bounds can be used to analyze existing buildings or help in the design phase of planning a building. Macroscopic approaches which are based on dynamic network flow models (minimum cost dynamic flow, maximum dynamic flow, universal maximum flow, quickest path and quickest flow) are described. A special feature of the presented approach is the fact, that travel times of evacuees are not restricted to be constant, but may be density dependent. Using multicriteria optimization priority regions and blockage due to fire or smoke may be considered. It is shown how the modelling can be done using time parameter either as discrete or continuous parameter. Microscopic models are able to model the individual evacuee's characteristics and the interaction among evacuees which influence their movement. Due to the corresponding huge amount of data one uses simulation approaches. Some probabilistic laws for individual evacuee's movement are presented. Moreover ideas to model the evacuee's movement using cellular automata (CA) and resulting software axe presented. In this paper we will focuss on macroscopic models and only summarize some of the results of the microscopic approach. While most of the results are applicable to general evacuation situations, we concentrate on building evacuation.

The proposed scheme was developed with the signal feature enhancement tool of discrete wavelet packet entropy measures. The Chebyshev neural network is presented as network-growing technique for protective classification, the single-layer structure of which is a more powerful classifier that eliminates the need for complicated network design. A comparative implementation study of the multi-layer perceptron and Chebyshev neural network authenticates benefits gained by the Chebyshev neural network. To demonstrate the advantage gained by Chebyshev neural networks compared to support vector machines, a comparative study is presented with a support vector machine based classification technique. The fault datawere obtained by dynamic simulation of a sample system using the real-time power system simulator PSCAD (Manitoba HVDC Research Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). Extensive testing reveals the effectiveness of the Chebyshev neural network for fault classification; a comparative study brings out the superiority of the Chebyshev neural network for neural network design and implementation against the multi-layer perceptron. The Chebyshev neural network proved advantageous against support vector machines as being insensitive to the classification parameter.

To tackle this challenging problem with discrete variables and coupled constraints, we propose an efficient framework of joint neural network (NN) design. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based NN and a deep-unfolding NN, which are employed to optimize the beam selection and digital precoding matrices, respectively. As for the DRL-based NN, we formulate the beam selection problem as a Markov decision process and a double deep Q-network algorithm is developed to solve it. Regarding the design of the digital precoding matrix, we develop an iterative weighted minimum mean-square error algorithm induced deep-unfolding NN, which unfolds this algorithm into a layer-wise structure. Simulation results show that our proposed jointly trained NN significantly outperforms the existing iterative algorithms.

The NCSs are considered as continuous-time linear multi-input multioutput (MIMO) systems with random reference noises. The controlled plants include unstable poles and nonminimum phase (NMP) zeros. The output feedback path is affected by multiple communication constraints. We focus on some basic communication constraints, including additive white noise (AWN), quantization noise, bandwidth, as well as encoder-decoder. The system performance is evaluated with the tracking error energy, and used a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) controller. The explicit representation of the tracking performance is given in this paper. The results indicate the tracking performance limitations rely to internal characteristics of the plant (unstable poles and NMP zeros), reference noises [the reference noise power distribution (RNPD) and its directions], and the characteristics of communication constraints. The characteristics of communication constraints include communication noise power distribution (CNPD); quantization noise power distribution (QNPD), and their distribution directions; transform bandwidth allocation (TBA); transform encoder-decoder allocation (TEA), and their allocation directions; and NMP zeros and MP part of bandwidth. Moreover, the tracking performance limitations are also affected by the angles between the each transform NMP zero direction and RNPD direction, and these angles between each transform unstable poles direction and the direction of communication constraint distribution/allocation. In addition, for MIMO NCSs, bandwidth (there are not identical two channels) can always affect the direction of unstable poles, and the channel allocation of bandwidth and encode-decode may be used for a feasible method for the performance allocation of each channel. Finally, an instance is given for verifying the effectiveness of the theoretical outcomes.

Emulation of Cloud Microphysics in a Climate Model	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												We present a machine learning based emulator of a microphysics scheme for condensation and precipitation processes (Zhao-Carr) used operationally in a global atmospheric forecast model (FV3GFS). Our tailored emulator architecture achieves high skill (>= 94%) in predicting condensate and precipitation amounts and maintains low global-average bias (<= 4%) for 1 year of continuous simulation when replacing the Fortran scheme. The stability and success of this emulator stems from key design decisions. By separating the emulation of condensation and precipitation processes, we can better enforce physical priors such as mass conservation and locality of condensation, and the vertical dependence of precipitation falling downward, using specific network architectures. An activity classifier for condensation imitates the discrete-continuous nature of the Fortran microphysics outputs (i.e., tendencies are identically zero where the scheme is inactive, and condensate is zero where clouds are fully evaporated). A temperature-scaled conditional loss function ensures accurate condensate adjustments for a high dynamic range of cloud types (e.g., cold, low-condensate cirrus clouds or warm, condensate-rich clouds). Despite excellent overall performance, the emulator exhibits some deficiencies in the uppermost model levels, leading to biases in the stratosphere. The emulator also has short episodic skill dropouts in isolated grid columns and is computationally slower than the original Fortran scheme. Nonetheless, our challenges and strategies should be applicable to the emulation of other microphysical schemes. More broadly, our work demonstrates that with suitable physically motivated architectural choices, ML techniques can accurately emulate complex human-designed parameterizations of fast physical processes central to weather and climate models. In this study, we create computer code that uses machine learning to mimic a weather model's algorithm for handling how clouds form and rain falls. When used in the weather model to replace this algorithm, our machine learning code is highly accurate in simulations for a whole year. We achieve this by making smart code design choices. We split the code into two parts: one for cloud formation and one for rain and snow. This allows us to better build important aspects of these processes into the machine learning approach. For instance, clouds form where it is moist and evaporate when it gets dry, and rain and snow fall downward. Our code learns cloud behavior based on temperature to ensure it works both for cold, thin clouds high up in the sky and warm, thick clouds closer to the ground. Our work shows a path for suitably designed machine learning code to eventually replace important parts of weather and climate models, but also that this path still requires careful human design respecting known physical principles. We build an emulator to replace the Zhao-Carr Fortran microphysics scheme in FV3GFS The integrated emulator sustains high skill throughout a 1-year simulation Tailoring the ML architecture to the structure of the underlying scheme greatly improves the online behavior of the emulator						Perkins, Walter/0000-0001-7742-7609; Brenowitz, Noah/0000-0001-8615-4921														1942-2466				APR	2024	16	4							e2023MS003851	10.1029/2023MS003851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023MS003851													WOS:001193099000001

Under a weaker assumption on activation functions, by constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), a set of sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) for the existence of state estimator such that the error system is global exponentially stable. Based on the delay partitioning method and the reciprocally convex approach, some less conservative stability criteria along with lower computational complexity are obtained. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the derived result.																			1687-1847					JUN 19	2015									189	10.1186/s13662-015-0498-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13662-015-0498-3													WOS:000356528300001

This paper uses an artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning toolbox in a MATLAB programming environment together with a Bayesian regularization algorithm, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and a scaled conjugate gradient algorithm to attain a specified target compressive strength at 28 days. The relationship between the four key parameters, namely water/solid ratio, alkaline activator/binder ratio, Na2SiO3/NaOH ratio and NaOH molarity, and the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete is determined. The geopolymer concrete mix proportions based on the ANN algorithm model and contour plots developed were experimentally validated. Thus, the proposed method can be used to determine mix designs for high calcium fly ash geopolymer concrete in the range 25-45 MPa at 28 days. In addition, the design equations developed using the statistical regression model provide an insight to predict tensile strength and elastic modulus for a given compressive strength.

Virtual reality (VR) and machine learning technologies, such as deep learning (DL) application, are promising diagnostic tools for ADHD in the near future because VR provides stimuli to replace real stimuli and recreate experiences with high realism. It also creates a playful virtual environment and reduces stress in children. The DL model is a subset of machine learning that can transform input and output data into diagnostic values using convolutional neural network systems. By using a sensitive and specific ADHD-VR diagnostic tool prototype for children with DL model, ADHD can be diagnosed more easily and accurately, especially in places with few mental health resources or where tele-consultation is possible. To date, several virtual reality-continuous performance test (VR-CPT) diagnostic tools have been developed for ADHD; however, they do not include a machine learning or deep learning application. A diagnostic tool development study needs a trustworthy and applicable study design and conduct to ensure the completeness and transparency of the report of the accuracy of the diagnostic tool.
