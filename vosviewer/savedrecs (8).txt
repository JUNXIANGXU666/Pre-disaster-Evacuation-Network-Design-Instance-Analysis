J	Aufiero, S; De Marzo, G; Sbardella, A; Zaccaria, A				Aufiero, Sabrina; De Marzo, Giordano; Sbardella, Angelica; Zaccaria, Andrea			Mapping job fitness and skill coherence into wages: an economic complexity analysis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Leveraging the discrete skill and knowledge worker requirements of each occupation provided by O*NET, our empirical approach employs network-based tools from the Economic Complexity framework to characterize the US occupational network. This approach provides insights into the interplay between wages and the complexity or relatedness of the skill sets within each occupation, complementing conventional human capital frameworks. Our empirical strategy is threefold. First, we construct the Job and Skill Progression Networks, where nodes represent jobs (skills) and a link between two jobs (skills) indicates statistically significant co-occurrence of skills required to carry out those two jobs, that can be useful tools to identify job-switching paths and skill complementarities Second, by harnessing the Fitness and Complexity algorithm, we define a data-driven skill-based complexity measure of jobs that positively maps, but with interesting deviations, into wages and in the bottom-up and broad abstract/manual and routine/non-routine job characterisations, however providing a continuous and endogenous metric to assess the degree of complexity of each occupational skill-set. Third, building on relatedness and corporate coherence metrics, we introduce a measure of each job's skill coherence, that negatively maps into wages. Our findings may inform policymakers and employers on designing more effective labour market policies and training schemes, that, rather than fostering hyper-specialization, should favor the acquisition of complex and "uncoherent" skill sets, enabling workers to more easily move throughout the job and skill progression networks and make informed career choices decisions while unlocking higher wage opportunities.																			2045-2322					MAY 23	2024	14	1							11752	10.1038/s41598-024-61448-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-61448-x								38783004					WOS:001230489600036

The core idea of this method is to determine a value function for evaluating the long-term benefit under a certain state by training from experiences, and then apply this value function to guide decisions in unknown situations. First, the process of agile satellite scheduling is modeled as a finite Markov decision process with continuous state space and discrete action space. Two subproblems of the agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem, i.e., the sequencing problem and the timing problem are solved by the part of the agent and the environment in the model, respectively. A satisfactory solution of the timing problem can be quickly produced by a constructive heuristic algorithm. The objective function of this problem is to maximize the total reward of the entire scheduling process. Based on the above design, we demonstrate that Q-network has advantages in fitting the long-term benefit of such problems. After that, we train the Q-network by Q-learning. The experimental results show that the trained Q-network performs efficiently to cope with unknown data, and can generate high total profit in a short time. The method has good scalability and can be applied to different types of satellite scheduling problems by customizing only the constraints checking process and reward signals.

Using a modified invasive weed optimization algorithm for a personalized urban multi-criteria path optimization problem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The personalized urban multi-criteria quasi-optimum path problem (PUMQPP) is a branch of multi-criteria shortest path problems (MSPPs) and it is classified as a NP-hard problem. To solve the PUMQPP, by considering dependent criteria in route selection, there is a need for approaches that achieve the best compromise of possible solutions/routes. Recently, invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm is introduced and used as a novel algorithm to solve many continuous optimization problems. In this study, the modified algorithm of IWO was designed, implemented, evaluated, and compared with the genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the PUMQPP in a directed urban transportation network. In comparison with the GA, the results have shown the significant superiority of the proposed modified IWO algorithm in exploring a discrete search-space of the urban transportation network. In this regard, the proposed modified IWO algorithm has reached better results in fitness function, quality metric and running-time values in comparison with those of the GA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Datasets are first generated using the advanced analysis to consider both geometric and material nonlinearities of the structure. Four GTB models are then proposed to predict the ultimate load-carrying capacity and displacement of the structure for safety evaluation of strength and serviceability. Both continuous and discrete input variables are considered. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, four popular ML methods including support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and deep learning (DL) are refereed in a comparison study. Three numerical examples of steel truss structures including a planar truss, a spatial truss, and a case study of planar truss bridge are considered in the comparative study. The numerical results show that the developed GTB models provide high accurate (more than 90%) regardless of the number of training data and design variable types and have the best performance in most considered cases.

The main objective of this paper is to design the L-2-L-infinity, H-infinity, passivity, strict (Q, S, R)-dissipativity, very-strict passivity filters in a unified framework so as to ensure that the filter error system is stochastically admissible and extended dissipative. By tuning the weighting matrices, the extended dissipativity performance can reduce to the L-2-L-infinity performance, H-infinity performance, passivity, strict (Q, S, R)-dissipativity and very-strict passivity, respectively. A mode-dependent and delay-dependent stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is proposed to reflect the information of Markovian jump modes and the time-varying delays, and a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are utilized to derive sufficient conditions which guarantee that the desired unified filters can be constructed. Three numerical examples including an oil catalytic cracking process (OCCP) are employed to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of the main results obtained.

J	AlRashidi, MR; AlHajri, MF				AlRashidi, M. R.; AlHajri, M. F.			Optimal planning of multiple distributed generation sources in distribution networks: A new approach	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT												An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is presented for optimal planning of multiple distributed generation sources (DG). This problem can be divided into two sub-problems: the DG optimal size (continuous optimization) and location (discrete optimization) to minimize real power losses. The proposed approach addresses the two sub-problems simultaneously using an enhanced PSO algorithm capable of handling multiple DG planning in a single run. A design of experiment is used to fine tune the proposed approach via proper analysis of PSO parameters interaction. The proposed algorithm treats the problem constraints differently by adopting a radial power flow algorithm to satisfy the equality constraints, i.e. power flows in distribution networks, while the inequality constraints are handled by making use of some of the PSO features. The proposed algorithm was tested on the practical 69-bus power distribution system. Different test cases were considered to validate the proposed approach consistency in detecting optimal or near optimal solution. Results are compared with those of Sequential Quadratic Programming.

Consequently, we formulate and investigate the novel problem CUL (Check-in-User Linking) in this work. Notably, the main difference between CUL and the existing problem TUL (Trajectory-User Linking) is that the trajectories used in TUL are continuous, while the check-in records in CUL are discrete. To tackle the problem CUL effectively, we develop a model entitled CULVAE (Check-in-User Linking via Variational Autoencoder). Firstly, a well-designed grid index is applied to organize the input check-in records. Then, an encoding module is developed to embed a user with corresponding grids. Next, a decoding module is proposed to generate a low-dimensional representation of each user. Finally, a multi-class classifier is proposed to link check-in records to users based on the output of the decoding module. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model CULVAE performs better than all state-of-art approaches.						li, yu jie/0000-0002-9924-6136													0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-031-20861-4; 978-3-031-20862-1				2022	13629						489	503		10.1007/978-3-031-20862-1_36	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20862-1_36													WOS:000897031800036

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used before to detect structural damage and evaluate its severity by utilising only raw vibration data. However, these vibration-based CNN applications were limited to discrete user-defined levels of damage. To provide a more accurate representation of structural damage, this paper aims to design and validate a framework for evaluating structural damage severity within a continuous range of damage levels, using 1D CNNs and distributed raw acceleration data. To this purpose, a simple Finite Element (FE) cantilever model with non-rigid rotational spring support was adopted. Damage was simulated at the support as reduction of the rotational spring stiffness. The performance of the proposed framework was assessed under different excitation scenarios and data pre-processing techniques. The results demonstrate the ability of 1D CNNs to evaluate damage severity with high accuracy. By estimating the reduced value of the rotational spring stiffness, the proposed framework can also be used towards FE model updating in parallel with damage severity evaluation.

Traditionally, diagnosis approaches are centralized, but these solutions do not scale well. Also, centralized diagnosis solutions are difficult to implement on increasingly prevalent distributed, networked embedded systems. This paper presents a distributed diagnosis framework for physical systems with continuous behavior. Using Possible Conflicts, a structural model decomposition method from the Artificial Intelligence model-based diagnosis (DX) community, we develop a distributed diagnoser design algorithm to build local event-based diagnosers. These diagnosers are constructed based on global diagnosability analysis of the system, enabling them to generate local diagnosis results that are globally correct without the use of a centralized coordinator. We also use Possible Conflicts to design local parameter estimators that are integrated with the local diagnosers to form a comprehensive distributed diagnosis framework. Hence, this is a fully distributed approach to fault detection, isolation, and identification. We evaluate the developed scheme on a four-wheeled rover for different design scenarios to show the advantages of using Possible Conflicts, and generate on-line diagnosis results in simulation to demonstrate the approach.

One of the well known multicarrier modulation systems is filter-bank multi-carrier with an offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM), which was proposed as a powerful solution during the standardization of 5G. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression of the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for FBMC/OQAM systems in the discrete-time context, for arbitrary wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channels as well as transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) waveforms. We quantify the potential gains in SINR brought by FBMC/OQAM, which exclusively operates on critical lattice density, with respect to FBMC/QAM, which have the flexibility to operate on critical or non-critical lattice densities. For completeness, we compare the performance of FBMC/OQAM in the discrete-time context, sweeping the discrete space of waveforms supports, with that of FBMC/OQAM in the continuous-time context, using the Hermite functions, and show how they perform similarly. Simulation results prove that FBMC/OQAM optimization algorithm, performing with the ping-pong optimized pulse shaping (POPS) paradigm, converges rapidly to excellent SINR values, even with small supports durations, in discrete-time context, which is equivalent to a reduced number of Hermite functions, in the continuous-time context.

How to reliably transmit information in a RIS-based communication system arouses much interest. This paper proposes a reflecting modulation (RM) scheme for RIS-based communications, where both the reflecting patterns and transmit signals can carry information. Depending on that the transmitter and RIS jointly or independently deliver information, RM is further classified into two categories: jointly mapped RM (JRM) and separately mapped RM (SRM). JRM and SRM are naturally superior to existing schemes, because the transmit signal vectors, reflecting patterns, and bit mapping methods of JRM and SRM are more flexibly designed. To enhance transmission reliability, this paper proposes a discrete optimization-based joint signal mapping, shaping, and reflecting (DJMSR) design for JRM and SRM to minimize the bit error rate (BER) with a given transmit signal candidate set and a given reflecting pattern candidate set. To further improve the performance, this paper optimizes multiple reflecting patterns and their associated transmit signal sets in continuous fields for JRM and SRM. Numerical results show that JRM and SRM with the proposed system optimization methods considerably outperform existing schemes in BER.					guo, shuaishuai/IWE-2340-2023; Ye, Jia/HNR-4508-2023	Zhang, Haixia/0000-0001-5081-7287; Guo, Shuaishuai/0000-0003-0885-7327; Zhang, Peng/0000-0001-9047-6130; Ye, Jia/0000-0002-7242-6065													0733-8716	1558-0008				NOV	2020	38	11					2548	2561		10.1109/JSAC.2020.3007060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2020.3007060													WOS:000579341000005
J	Nielsen, J; Zwierzchowski, S				Nielsen, J; Zwierzchowski, S			Power spectral density of a UWB signal with discrete quantized pulse positions	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING-REVUE CANADIENNE DE GENIE ELECTRIQUE ET INFORMATIQUE												The FCC specification for ultra-wideband (UWB) emissions states that the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) cannot exceed -41.3 dBm per 1 MHz bandwidth in the frequency region of 3.1 to 10.6 GHz. Hence, to achieve adequate transmit power in a UWB data link it is necessary to use a wide-bandwidth modulation scheme. This requirement presents a pair of technical challenges which are addressed in this paper. The first challenge is to realize a wide-bandwidth radiated transmitter pulse shape which adequately covers the UWB band from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz. The second challenge is to structure the modulation such that the discrete line component of the power spectral density (PSD) of the transmitted signal is minimized. This is necessary as the discrete spectral components are essentially wasted power and limit the output transmitted power due to the FCC EIRP mask. In this paper the radiated EIRP of a UWB signal based on pulse position modulation (PPM) is explored. Previous researchers have derived the PSD under the supposition that the PPM pulse delay is continuous. However, simpler and more insightful expressions are possible for the PPM PSD if the pulse delays are restricted to quantized steps, as is assumed in this paper. A network-analysis approach for determining the EIRP of the unmodulated radiated pulses is given based on spectral measurements of an experimental UWB transceiver pair. These EIRP characteristics are applied to the derived equations for the continuous and discrete portions of the PSD of the UWB signal. From this, insights emerge into optimum PPM transmitter implementation that maximizes transmit power and minimizes power losses due to the discrete spectral lines. As demonstrated in this paper, such optimization necessitates the joint design of the UWB transmitter radiated pulse shape and PPM structure.																			0840-8688					JUL-OCT	2003	28	3-4					145	154		10.1109/CJECE.2003.1425101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2003.1425101													WOS:000189114700007
J	Delle Site, P				Delle Site, Paolo			A mixed-behaviour equilibrium model under predictive and static Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) and state-dependent route choice	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												In transportation planning and design studies it is customary to consider the network in its equilibrium state. Equilibrium conditions in the presence of Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) and recurrent congestion have been formulated either according to some behavioural principle derived from Wardrop's assumption, or as fixed-point states of day-to-day dynamic assignment processes. In the latter approach only, a differentiation has been introduced between predictive ATIS and ATIS providing static information, but the impacts on equilibrium travel times are relatively unexplored. In addition, the route choice updating model is formulated without consideration of state-dependent effects, such as inertia to change. This forms the motivation for the present paper. According to traffic information sources, three classes of users are considered: (a) users with predictive information, (b) users with static information and compliant, (c) users not equipped with ATIS or noncompliant. Users of the three classes make choices in a stochastic manner based on a logit model subject to inertia. Users of the first class have lower perception variance in view of the higher information quality. The compliance rate is endogenous and dependent on the information accuracy of the static ATIS. The fixed points in the class specific route flows of the dynamic day-to-day processes characterise a new concept of network equilibrium, referred to as Mixed User Equilibrium (MUE), where, if each user shifts from her currently used route to her newly chosen route, the observed class-specific route flows do not change. A variant of the method of successive averages is proposed for computing MUE. The model is illustrated by an example related to the Nguyen-Dupuis network. The impacts on equilibrium travel times of the market penetration of ATIS with different functionalities as well as of inertia are examined.

Online monitoring of Mezcal fermentation based on redox potential measurements	BIOPROCESS AND BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												We describe an algorithm for the continuous monitoring of the biomass and ethanol concentrations as well as the growth rate in the Mezcal fermentation process. The algorithm performs its task having available only the online measurements of the redox potential. The procedure combines an artificial neural network (ANN) that relates the redox potential to the ethanol and biomass concentrations with a nonlinear observer-based algorithm that uses the ANN biomass estimations to infer the growth rate of this fermentation process. The results show that the redox potential is a valuable indicator of the metabolic activity of the microorganisms during Mezcal fermentation. In addition, the estimated growth rate can be considered as a direct evidence of the presence of mixed culture growth in the process. Usually, mixtures of microorganisms could be intuitively clear in this kind of processes; however, the total biomass data do not provide definite evidence by themselves.

J	Singh, T; Kumari, M; Gupta, DS				Singh, Tajinder; Kumari, Madhu; Gupta, Daya Sagar			Rumor identification and diffusion impact analysis in real-time text stream using deep learning	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING												Researchers have applied marvelous endeavors in developing and designing methodologies to understand the behavioral of social media data. Various social media data have allegedly been used as a platform of rumor promotions with momentous political, economic, personal and social outcomes in numerous countries. In the existing approaches, diffusion rate of rumor words in terms of continuous and discrete time is not analyzed on the basis of their contextual polarity including their impact on social media users. It has been observed that the trust on rumor words based on user classification also plays a significant role which needs to be addressed. Therefore, we designed rumor detection and analysis methodologies in continuous and discrete time via deep learning. An efficient preprocessing approach is designed to clean the collected data. A weigh-based threshold mechanism is opted to compute various rumor-based features and their diffusion tendency in the continuous and discrete case. The proposed approach is tested on five sets of real-time data and on comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods which are CNN, KNN, LSTM and Word2Vec and noticed that rumor keyword recall and rumor keyword precision has been significantly improved. Efficiency of the proposed approach in terms of rumor-based keyword detection is also computed in which proposed approach detects 84.58, 83.46, 83.59, 83.05 and 84.47 with less loss of data than existing SOTA methods. Computation time of proposed approach is 0.59, 0.53, 0.57, 0.49, 0.47 for CoAID, FakeNewsNet, LIAR, CORD-19 and PHEME, respectively, which is quite less than SOTA methods (LSTM, CNN, Word2Vec and KNN). Practically, our proposed approach will play a significant role to improve the eminence of the rumor detection mechanism for social media platforms. Further, if we categorize the people on the basis of their influential role to spread rumor, then the trust factor based on user's classification is computed. A real-time case study is an evidence of the efficiency of our proposed approach which provide empirical findings of detecting online rumor including trust based on social media user crowd.

However, planes can also cause switching noise coupling, especially when they resonate. This is a concern for mixed-signal boards, high-speed I/Os, and electromagnetic compatibility. Discrete decoupling capacitors are ineffective to control switching noise at gigahertz frequency regime due to their inductance. To filter such high-frequency noise, a possible approach is modifying the shape of the PG planes, such as in power islands or electromagnetic bandgap structures. In this paper, we introduce the nonoverlapping PG planes design methodology for filtering of gigahertz power plane noise. Unlike existing approaches, our approach is simple and has wide bandwidth, while avoiding narrow inductive bridges that increase IR-drop.

Discrete by nature, they must be transformed into continuous and differentiable problems, typically by applying the first-order Stirling approximation. Although it does a reasonable job for large trip flows, this approximation produces significant errors when flows are small. This paper presents two alternatives using the second-order Stirling approximation and Burnside's formula to specify new distribution models that improve prediction for small trip values. In an application to real data for the Santiago, Chile metro system, both proposed formulations obtained results with superior goodness-of-fit and predictive capacity to a traditional model using a first-order Stirling approximation. The version incorporating the second-order Stirling approximation delivered the best performance.

This paper focuses on how reuse can be accomplished by using a conceptual model (CM) in a community of interest (COI). We address the issue of reuse in a multifaceted manner covering many areas (types) of M&S such as discrete, continuous, Monte Carlo, system dynamics, gaining-based, and agent-based. M&S is commonly employed and reuse is critically needed by many CON such as air traffic control, automobile manufacturing, ballistic missile defense, business process reengineering, emergency response management, military training, network-centric operations and warfare, supply chain management, telecommunications, and transportation. We present how a CM developed for a COI can assist in reuse for the design of any type of large-scale complex M&S application in that COI. A CM becomes an asset for a COI and offers significant economic benefits through its effective reuse.																					978-1-4244-2707-9				2008							959	+		10.1109/WSC.2008.4736162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2008.4736162													WOS:000274496200113

The exact DT model for the nonlinear system is unavailable in general, and thus approximate models must be employed for control design. Conditions that ensure practical stability of the exact DT model for all sufficiently small sampling periods based on the stability of the approximate model exist in the literature. Most of these existing results assume that the sampling period is kept constant during operation, and show that stability holds if the sampling period is small enough. Since such results may be not valid in a varying sampling rate (VSR) setting, previous work focused on a suitable extension, specifically aimed at controller-driven sampling (CDS). In this paper, we show that a specific stability property named (beta, R-n)-stability, and its CDS extension, named (beta, R-n)-stability under VSR, are equivalent. The equivalence of these two properties is not trivial, in the sense that it cannot be deduced directly from their definitions. We also provide an epsilon-delta characterization of (beta, R-n)-stability under VSR which may be useful in establishing the equivalence between other stability properties and their corresponding CDS extensions.																					978-987-544-754-7				2017																								WOS:000427184900054

In contrast to the deterministic mathematical programming approach, we use scenarios. to represent the uncertainties in demand. This formulation leads to a very large scale mixed integer-programming problem which is intractable. We apply Lagrangian relaxation and its corresponding decomposition of the initial problem in a novel way, whereby the Lagrangian relaxation is reinterpreted as a column generator and the integer feasible solutions are used to approximate the given problem. This approach addresses two closely related problems of scenario analysis and two-stage stochastic programs. Computational solutions for large data instances of these problems are carried out successfully and their solutions analysed and reported.

Our algorithm is benchmarked on a Chinese data. Computational results demonstrate that the algorithm can find the best solution of all the problems within 0.14 seconds, so the heuristic algorithm has strong ability and quick efficiency in finding Optimal Solutions.																					978-1-4244-2723-9				2009							2156	2160																WOS:000274047200424

This paper also discusses the controller discretization and presents a new algorithm to obtain the upper bound for the sample interval through which the exponential stability of the discrete system can still be guaranteed. Firstly, an integral sliding surface is designed to obtain the sliding mode dynamics for the considered stochastic Levy process. By using Lyapunov theory, generalized Ito formula and some inequality techniques, the exponential stability is proved in the sense of mean square for sliding mode dynamics. The reachability of the sliding mode surface is also ensured by designing a sliding mode control law. Secondly, the continuous-time controller is discretized from the point of control cost, and the squared difference is analyzed for the states before and after the discretization. Different from those classical stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motions, the noise is supposed to be Levy type and the squared difference is analyzed in different cases. Furthermore, we obtain the largest sampling interval through which the discretized controller can still stabilize the Levy process driven stochastic system. Finally, a simulation for a drill bit system is given to demonstrate the results under the algorithms. & COPY; 2023 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An asynchronous filter is considered such that the phenomena of asynchronous modes between the original singular Markov jump systems and the considered filter is modelled as a hidden Markov model. A dynamic event-based scheme is proposed to further mitigate the network transmission burden. By augmenting the states of the original singular Markov jump systems and the constructed asynchronous filter, the filtering error system is transformed into a singular time-delay Markov jump system. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional concerning the internal dynamic variable, the criteria of stochastically admissible and stochastically finite-time boundness with the given mixed H-infinity and passivity performance index for the filtering error system are subject to linear matrix inequalities and several constraint conditions. Furthermore, the unified co-design approach of the desired asynchronous filter and the proposed dynamic event-based strategy is developed. Finally, a numerical instance is employed to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the developed technique. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, it is used to learn the optimal controls of the partially unknown multi-input nonlinear system. Firstly, the Nash equilibrium of multi-input is defined. Two neural networks (NN) are used to approximate the cost functions with the integral reinforcement signal, which can avoid directly solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation such that dynamic information and derivatives of NN activations are not needed. Then, a novel learning algorithm is used to update the unknown NN weights. The studied weights are used to obtain the optimum multi-policies. The learned weight convergence is proved. Finally, two examples are presented to verify the system performance with the proposed AIRL scheme.

The main idea lies in that the optimal robust guaranteed cost control problem can be transformed into an optimal control problem. Actually, the optimal cost function of the nominal system is nothing but the optimal guaranteed cost of the original uncertain system. A critic neural network is constructed to help solving the modified Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the nominal system. Then, an additional stabilizing term is introduced to reinforce the updating process of the weight vector and reduce the requirement of an initial stabilizing control. An example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the present control approach.

We assume that each agent has limited information about the problem data and communicates with other agents at discrete times of its choice. Our main contribution is the development of a distributed continuous-time dynamics and a set of state-based rules, termed triggers, that an individual agent can use to determine when to broadcast its state to neighboring agents to ensure convergence. Our technical approach to the algorithm design and analysis overcomes a number of challenges, including establishing convergence in the absence of a common smooth Lyapunov function, ensuring that the triggers are detectable by agents using only local information, and accounting for the asynchronism in the state broadcasts of the agents. Simulations illustrate our results.

In particular, successful operation of oil companies depends on systematic decisions over complex logistics. The present article focuses on the decision-making process involved in petroleum production planning. The proposed model is based on a nonlinear programming formulation that was developed to plan production over a single period. First, the model incorporates multiple planning periods and the selection of different crude oil types. Uncertainty related to petroleum and product prices as well as demand is then included as a set of discrete probabilities. Finally, crude oil handling constraints are added. The resulting models are mixed integer nonlinear programs(MINLP), which were successfully applied to a real-world case at the Petrobras REVAP refinery. Problems of up to 19 time periods and up to five scenarios were solved to optimality.

The h-counting process can be used to model counting phenomena for which the increments are not necessarily instantaneous. This h-counting model can also be used to represent uncertainties on the exact locations of state transitions of a standard discrete event system.

Robust asymptotic tracking of a class of nonlinear systems using an adaptive critic based controller	2010 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE	Proceedings of the American Control Conference				American Control Conference	JUN 30-JUL 02, 2010	Baltimore, MD					Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) controllers are based on a discrete formulation of the Dynamic Programming (DP) problem, which impedes the development of rigorous stability analysis of continuous-time closed loop controllers for uncertain nonlinear systems. Non-DP based RL controllers typically yield a uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability result due to the presence of disturbances and unknown approximation errors. In this paper a non-DP based reinforcement learning scheme is developed for asymptotic tracking of a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances. A recently developed RISE (Robust Integral of the Sign of the Error) feedback technique is used in conjunction with a feedforward neural network (NN) based Actor-Critic architecture to yield a semi-global asymptotic result. A composite weight tuning law for the Action NN, consisting of both unsupervised and reinforcement learning terms, is developed based on Lyapunov stability analysis.

J	RAJ, R; THOMPSON, LR				RAJ, R; THOMPSON, LR			DESIGN OF THE MICROSTRUCTURAL SCALE FOR OPTIMUM TOUGHENING IN METALLIC COMPOSITES	ACTA METALLURGICA ET MATERIALIA												The role of the microstructural scale in toughening of composites containing a metallic constituent is described by invoking a dislocation pile-up mechanism for debonding at metal ceramic (intermetallic) interfaces. Below a certain size of the metal phase, the pile-up length becomes subcritical precluding debonding. The toughening effect below and above this critical size separates into two kinds of behavior leading to a maximum toughness when plotted against the characteristic length of the metal phase. The position of this maximum defines the optimum microstructural scale. The concept is applied successfully to metal-ceramic and metal-intermetallic composites with a microstructural length scale of less than about 10 mum. Metal matrix composites where the metal forms a continuous network through the microstructure are shown to have much higher toughness than the case where the same volume of the metal phase is distributed as discrete particles in the composite.																			0956-7151					DEC	1994	42	12					4135	4142		10.1016/0956-7151(94)90190-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0956-7151(94)90190-2													WOS:A1994PQ61900021

The Coral Reefs Optimization Algorithm: A Novel Metaheuristic for Efficiently Solving Optimization Problems	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL												This paper presents a novel bioinspired algorithm to tackle complex optimization problems: the coral reefs optimization (CRO) algorithm. The CRO algorithm artificially simulates a coral reef, where different corals (namely, solutions to the optimization problem considered) grow and reproduce in coral colonies, fighting by choking out other corals for space in the reef. This fight for space, along with the specific characteristics of the corals' reproduction, produces a robust metaheuristic algorithm shown to be powerful for solving hard optimization problems. In this research the CRO algorithm is tested in several continuous and discrete benchmark problems, as well as in practical application scenarios (i.e., optimum mobile network deployment and off-shore wind farm design). The obtained results confirm the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm and open line of research for further application of the algorithm to real-world problems.

J	Wang, J; Situ, CQ; Yu, MZ				Wang, Jian; Situ, Chenqi; Yu, Mingzhu			The post-disaster emergency planning problem with facility location and people/resource assignment	KYBERNETES												Purpose This paper aims to study a dynamic post-disaster emergency planning (PDEP) problem in an integrated network through the investigation of the selection of shelters, medical centers and distribution centers (DCs), and the allocation of evacuees and injured people. The resource and people assignment in multiple periods are considered. Design/methodology/approach A mathematical formulation is provided for the PDEP problem. The authors decompose the model into two sub-models as follows: the primary model is an integer programming model and the subproblem is a nonlinear programming model with continuous variables. The simulated annealing is used to solve the primary problem, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) mixed with beetle antennae search (BAS) is used to solve the subproblem. Findings The paper finds that BAS can increase the stability of PSO and keep the advantages of PSO's rapid convergence. By implementing these algorithms on emergency planning after the Wenchuan earthquake that happened in China in 2008, this paper finds that the priority of different levels of injured people is influenced by several factors. Even within the same disaster, the priority of different levels of injured can be inconsistent because of the differences in resource levels. Originality/value The authors integrate the shelters, medical centers and DCs as a system, and simultaneously, consider evacuees and injured people and different resource assignments. The authors divide the injured people into three levels and use survival rate function to simulate the survival conditions of different people. The authors provide an improved PSO algorithm to solve the problem.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for the detection of 3D tubular structures that is particularly suited to capture the geometry of vessel-like networks, such as dendritic trees and vascular systems. Even though our approach relies on a system of isotropic multiscale analyzing atoms, we prove that their interaction via convolution with a tubular structure is equivalent to a set of directional atoms at various scales, automatically oriented along any possible direction and with cylindrical symmetry. This result sets the theoretical groundwork for the design of efficient discrete algorithms aiming at extracting the geometry of vessel-like structures in 3D medical images. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our method employs a hierarchical hypersphere-based constraint that organizes weight vectors hierarchically based on observed data. By diversifying the parameter space of hyperplanes in the classification layer, we aim to encourage discriminative generalization. We introduce a self-supervised grouping method designed to unveil hierarchical structures in scenarios with unknown hierarchy information. To maximize distances between weight vectors on multiple hyperspheres, we propose a novel metric that combines discrete and continuous measures. This regularization encourages diverse orientations, consequently leading to improved generalization. Extensive evaluations on datasets, including CUB200-2011, Stanford-Cars, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, consistently demonstrate enhancements in classification performance compared to baseline settings.

Therefore, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based classifier designed to identify unnecessary strokes and clutter that arise during the radar-based air-writing. First, while air-writing the digits from 0 to 9, the range, angle, and signal amplitude of the hand movement are obtained through a radar system. Then, we represent the hand's trajectory in the form of x and y coordinates using the information of range and angle. Next, we train the DNN-based classifier using the acquired x and y coordinates, signal amplitude, and frame index as input features. To ensure the classifier's performance would not be impacted by the changes in the position and size of the air-writing area, we apply the normalization to the x and y coordinates. Finally, the performance of the classifier is verified using the results of air-writing digits from 0 to 9. The proposed method identifies unnecessary strokes and clutter regardless of the position and size of the air-writing area, demonstrating an average classification accuracy of 94.57%. Furthermore, when the classifier was validated with different individuals conducting the air-writing, the classifier exhibited an average classification accuracy of 93.9%.

A modular formal semantics for Ptolemy	MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE												Ptolemy(double dagger) is an open-source and extensible modelling and simulation framework. It offers heterogeneous modeling capabilities by allowing different models of computation, both untimed and timed, to be composed hierarchically in an arbitrary fashion. This paper proposes a formal semantics for Ptolemy that is modular in the sense that atomic actors and their compositions are treated in a unified way. In particular, all actors conform to an executable interface that contains four functions: fire (produce outputs given current state and inputs); postfire (update state instantaneously); deadline (how much time the actor is willing to let elapse); and time-update (update the state with the passage of time). Composite actors are obtained using composition operators that in Ptolemy are called directors. Different directors realise different models of computation. In this paper, we formally define the directors for the following models of computation: synchronousreactive, discrete event, continuous time, process networks and modal models.

The relay node stores energy during poor channel conditions, increasing the energy efficiency. Theoretical analyses on the performance of the two proposed protocols are given. It is found that the throughput depends on various system parameters, such as the transfer power at the relay, distance between and so on.

Nowadays, they are entitled to drive innovation and competition in different fields such as agriculture, building design and automation, energy, healthcare, transportation and, above all, industrial manufacturing. In fact, CPS technology is going to transform the way people interact with engineered systems -- just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. Among CPS technologies, measurement and networking ones play a fundamental role, being enrolled as the natural bridge between the cyber and physical components of a CPS. A number of interconnected sensors and transducers are claimed to give inner and outer, local measurement data that, once processed through suitable algorithms and analytics, have to provide reliable information about the effectiveness of the whole CPS and its interaction with the external world, as well as its health status for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. So, great attention has to be paid to network models and architectures, to sensor forms and functions, in order to make CPSs properly integrate the continuous and the discrete, compounded by the uncertainty of open environments. The paper aims at opening a preliminary discussion on the role and features of measurement and networking technologies in CPS application fields, with special regard to industrial manufacturing, within a scientific community traditionally close to instrumentation and measurement (IM) issues, in order to stimulate and encourage useful and fruitful cross-fertilization. After some details concerning the general structure of a CPS, its typical architectural model and main features, a special focus is put on CPSs involved in industrial manufacturing along with measurement and networking facets. Some considerations about major measurement challenges that the CPS self-awareness feature poses in maintenance and troubleshooting operations are then drawn. Concluding remarks are finally reported.

By introducing a concept of intelligent adjustment factor, a distributed impulsive protocol is designed, in which only the delayed sampled relative positions to neighbors and the relative position to the last sampling state are utilized. Combined with the characteristic of impulsive control, three steps of model transformation are performed, and the assignment driven multi-consensus problem of the original continuous-time system is converted to the stability problem of a discrete-time expanded analogous error system. A necessary and sufficient criterion is derived to guarantee the assignment-driven multi consensus of the multi-agent system. An interesting simulation is proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical result and reveal the effect of intelligent adjustment factors on the assignment-driven multi-consensus.																			1948-3449		978-1-5090-1738-6				2016							553	558																WOS:000381734900093

Improving Accuracy in the Montgomery County Corrections Program Using Case Based Reasoning	SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS					7th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 11-13, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE SMC, Calif State Univ, Bakersfield, Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat				The Montgomery County Corrections Program is a program designed to address the problem of overcrowded jails by providing an out-of-jail rehabilitative program as an alternative. The candidate offenders chosen for this program are offenders convicted on nonviolent charges and are currently chosen subjectively with little statistical basis. In addition, historical data has been recorded on offenders who have passed through the program, making the program a good candidate for case-based reasoning. Using such reasoning, County Officials would like an objective measurement which will predict the success or failure of a candidate offender based on past offender history. The four case-based reasoning algorithms chosen for this prediction are Discrete, Continuous and Distance Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors and a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN). Although all four algorithms prove to be an improvement on the current system, the GRNN performs the best, with an average accuracy rate of 68%.

The combination of animal-derived proteins and plant-based proteins offer the possibility to create nutritional, sustainable, and also textural advantageous products. However, interactions between proteins from different sources and with different molecular features are not well-understood yet. By analyzing the interactions between whey (WPI) and potato proteins (PPIs), we can determine how gel structures in protein gels form. Through different mixing ratios, pH levels, and ionic strengths, we show how the formation of disulfide and hydrophobic bonds influence the textural properties of protein gels. It could be shown that, up to a 50:50 mixing ratio, the properties of PPI dominate those of WPI. Gels with a high elasticity could be formed only through the development of a continuous disulfide network.

J	Rene, ER; Veiga, MC; Kennes, C				Rene, Eldon R.; Veiga, Maria C.; Kennes, Christian			Experimental and neural model analysis of styrene removal from polluted air in a biofilter	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												BACKGROUND: Biofilters are efficient systems for treating malodorous emissions. The mechanism involved during pollutant transfer and subsequent biotransformation within a biofilm is a complex process. The use of artificial neural networks to model the performance of biofilters using easily measurable state variables appears to be an effective alternative to conventional phenomenological modelling. RESULTS: An artificial neural network model was used to predict the extent of styrene removal in a perlite-biofilter inoculated with a mixed microbial culture. After a 43 day biofilter acclimation period, styrene removal experiments were carried out by subjecting the bioreactor to different flow rates (0.15-0.9 m(3) h(-1)) and concentrations (0.5-17.2 g m(-3)), that correspond to inlet loading rates up to 1390 g m(-3) h(-1). During the different phases of continuous biofilter operation, greater than 92% styrene removal was achievable for loading rates up to 250 g m(-3) h(-1). A back propagation neural network algorithm was applied to model and predict the removal efficiency (%) of this process using inlet concentration (g m(-3)) and unit flow (h(-1)) as input variables. The data points were divided into training (115 x 3) and testing set (42 x 3). The most reliable condition for the network was selected by a trial and error approach and by estimating the determination coefficient (R-2) value (0.98) achieved during prediction of the testing set. CONCLUSION: The results showed that a simple neural network based model with a topology of 2-4-1 was able to efficiently predict the styrene removal performance in the biofilter. Through sensitivity analysis, the most influential input parameter affecting styrene removal was ascertained to be the flow rate.

Each one of these two elements, neighbours and barriers, makes the problems harder than their standard counterparts. Therefore, mixing both together results in a new challenging problem that, as far as we know, has not been addressed before but that has applications for inspection and surveillance activities and the delivery industry assuming uniformly distributed demand in some regions. We provide exact mathematical programming formulations for both problems assuming polygonal barriers and neighbours that are second -order cone (SOC) representable. These hypotheses give rise to mixed integer SOC formulations that we preprocess and strengthen with valid inequalities. The paper also reports computational experiments showing that our exact method can solve instances with 75 neighbourhoods and a range between 125-145 barriers.

The overall cost of establishing a Video-On-Demand system also includes the channel cost. Several caching and hatching schemes have been proposed in literature for the optimal utilization of these channels. A viewer is served with a mix or main and small (e.g. advertisement) movies. The requested movies not necessarily will be of same duration. This study deals with the system having limited number of channels and servicing of requests for mixed movies of different durations. The system is modeled for its behavior with a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) process.

The DSP is a very complex mixed binary nonlinear programming problem. A CHA is aimed at obtaining an excellent quality solution for the DSP problem. However, a local improvement phase and a branching technique were implemented in the CHA to improve its solution. In each step of the CHA, a sensitivity index is used to add a circuit or a substation to the distribution system. This sensitivity index is obtained by solving the DSP problem considering the numbers of circuits and substations to be added as continuous variables (relaxed problem). The relaxed problem is a large and complex nonlinear programming and was solved through an efficient nonlinear optimization solver. Results of two tests systems and one real distribution system are presented in this paper in order to show the ability of the proposed algorithm.

In this contribution, a simple numerical layout optimization formulation is presented and used to identify the topologies of minimum volume tensegrity structures designed to carry external applied loads. Binary variables and associated constraints are used to limit (usually to one) the number of compressive elements connecting a node. A computationally efficient two-stage procedure employing mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is used to identify structures capable of carrying both externally applied loads and the self-stresses present when these loads are removed. Although tensegrity structures are often regarded as inherently 'optimal', the presence of additional constraints in the optimization formulation means that they can never be more optimal than traditional, non-tensegrity, structures. The proposed procedure is programmed in a MATLAB script (available for download) and a range of examples are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach presented.

J	Yang, ZX; Xu, W; Wong, PK; Wang, XB				Yang, Zhixin; Xu, Wei; Wong, Pak-Kin; Wang, Xianbo			Modeling of RFID-Enabled Real-Time Manufacturing Execution System in Mixed-Model Assembly Lines	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												To quickly respond to the diverse product demands, mixed-model assembly lines are well adopted in discrete manufacturing industries. Besides the complexity in material distribution, mixed-model assembly involves a variety of components, different process plans and fast production changes, which greatly increase the difficulty for agile production management. Aiming at breaking through the bottlenecks in existing production management, a novel RFID-enabled manufacturing execution system (MES), which is featured with real-time and wireless information interaction capability, is proposed to identify various manufacturing objects including WIPs, tools, and operators, etc., and to trace their movements throughout the production processes. However, being subject to the constraints in terms of safety stock, machine assignment, setup, and scheduling requirements, the optimization of RFID-enabled MES model for production planning and scheduling issues is a NP-hard problem. A new heuristical generalized Lagrangian decomposition approach has been proposed for model optimization, which decomposes the model into three subproblems: computation of optimal configuration of RFID senor networks, optimization of production planning subjected to machine setup cost and safety stock constraints, and optimization of scheduling for minimized overtime. RFID signal processing methods that could solve unreliable, redundant, and missing tag events are also described in detail. The model validity is discussed through algorithm analysis and verified through numerical simulation. The proposed design scheme has important reference value for the applications of RFID in multiple manufacturing fields, and also lays a vital research foundation to leverage digital and networked manufacturing system towards intelligence.

The synthesized IPNs show promise for application as vibrational dampers. Raman spectroscopy and imaging were successfully utilized to establish IPN formation for the first time. The different viscoelastic properties of the IPNs were investigated in detail. Rigidity, entanglement density and phase mixing at the interface were enhancing by increasing the PMMA loading. The significant inward shifts of the glass transition temperatures of the SBR and PMMA phases proved their mixing in the IPNs. The cross-linking of the SBR and PMMA phases contributed to the viscoelastic behavior of the IPNs. The semi-IPN with the same composition possessed a slightly higher storage modulus and damping property compared to the corresponding IPN. The experimental values of area under the linear loss modulus were larger than those obtained by group contribution analysis. Five different composite models were employed for theoretical predictions. Among them, the Davies model most accurately reproduced the experimental data. The homogeneity of the system was further studied with Cole-Cole analysis. Morphological analyses using SEM, AFM, and TEM provided clear insights into the component distributions in the IPNs. The co-continuous morphology of IPN predicted by DMA analysis, particularly at high PMMA concentration, is in good agreement with the morphological analyses and theoretical predictions. This protocol for IPN characterization can serve as a platform for designing new vibrational dampers and their chemistries.

Adaptive Neural Network Stochastic-Filter-Based Controller for Attitude Tracking With Disturbance Rejection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												This article proposes a real-time neural network (NN) stochastic filter-based controller on the Lie group of the special orthogonal group SO(3) as a novel approach to the attitude tracking problem. The introduced solution consists of two parts: a filter and a controller. First, an adaptive NN-based stochastic filter is proposed, which estimates attitude components and dynamics using measurements supplied by onboard sensors directly. The filter design accounts for measurement uncertainties inherent to the attitude dynamics, namely, unknown bias and noise corrupting angular velocity measurements. The closed-loop signals of the proposed NN-based stochastic filter have been shown to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Second, a novel control law on SO(3) coupled with the proposed estimator is presented. The control law addresses unknown disturbances. In addition, the closed-loop signals of the proposed filter-based controller have been shown to be SGUUB. The proposed approach offers robust tracking performance by supplying the required control signal given data extracted from low-cost inertial measurement units. While the filter-based controller is presented in continuous form, the discrete implementation is also presented. In addition, the unit-quaternion form of the proposed approach is given. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed filter-based controller are demonstrated using its discrete form and considering low sampling rate, high initialization error, high level of measurement uncertainties, and unknown disturbances.

J	Suresh, K; Severn, C; Ghosh, D				Suresh, Krithika; Severn, Cameron; Ghosh, Debashis			Survival prediction models: an introduction to discrete-time modeling	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY												Background Prediction models for time-to-event outcomes are commonly used in biomedical research to obtain subject-specific probabilities that aid in making important clinical care decisions. There are several regression and machine learning methods for building these models that have been designed or modified to account for the censoring that occurs in time-to-event data. Discrete-time survival models, which have often been overlooked in the literature, provide an alternative approach for predictive modeling in the presence of censoring with limited loss in predictive accuracy. These models can take advantage of the range of nonparametric machine learning classification algorithms and their available software to predict survival outcomes. Methods Discrete-time survival models are applied to a person-period data set to predict the hazard of experiencing the failure event in pre-specified time intervals. This framework allows for any binary classification method to be applied to predict these conditional survival probabilities. Using time-dependent performance metrics that account for censoring, we compare the predictions from parametric and machine learning classification approaches applied within the discrete time-to-event framework to those from continuous-time survival prediction models. We outline the process for training and validating discrete-time prediction models, and demonstrate its application using the open-source R statistical programming environment. Results Using publicly available data sets, we show that some discrete-time prediction models achieve better prediction performance than the continuous-time Cox proportional hazards model. Random survival forests, a machine learning algorithm adapted to survival data, also had improved performance compared to the Cox model, but was sometimes outperformed by the discrete-time approaches. In comparing the binary classification methods in the discrete time-to-event framework, the relative performance of the different methods varied depending on the data set. Conclusions We present a guide for developing survival prediction models using discrete-time methods and assessing their predictive performance with the aim of encouraging their use in medical research settings. These methods can be applied to data sets that have continuous time-to-event outcomes and multiple clinical predictors. They can also be extended to accommodate new binary classification algorithms as they become available. We provide R code for fitting discrete-time survival prediction models in a github repository.																				1471-2288				JUL 26	2022	22	1							207	10.1186/s12874-022-01679-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12874-022-01679-6								35883032					WOS:000830718600002
J	Valencia, A; Zhang, W; Chang, NB				Valencia, Andrea; Zhang, Wei; Chang, Ni-Bin			Integration of machine learning classifiers and higher order tensors for screening the optimal recipe of filter media in stormwater treatment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Filter media have oftentimes been used in fixed-bed column tests to examine their removal efficiencies for various pollutants, such as nutrients in stormwater runoff. With limited data sets from column studies, a response surface method (RSM), such as the Box-Behnken Design (BBD), and machine learning methods, can be used to transition from discrete mode assessment to continuous mode optimization, from which the key ingredients of filter media can be better synergized. In this study, similarly to drug discovery via chemometrics, RSM is used to generate meta-models and identify the optimum ratio between clay and iron-filings contents in Iron-filingsbased Green Environmental Media (IFGEM) for nutrient removal in stormwater treatment. To achieve the continuous mode optimization, artificial neural network (ANN), deep belief network (DBN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were selected as machine learning models to compare with BBD to explore the limited column data sets and improve the data science. While separate RSM can help realize the removal efficiencies of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and ammonia based on varying ratios of clay and iron-filings contents in IFGEM, heterogeneous and inconsistent response surfaces generated from the four learners or classifiers (ANN, ELM, DBN, and BBD) complicate the selection of the final optimal recipe. The power of higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) helps synergize the optimal clay and iron filingsmatrixes of IFGEMin the context of continuous mode optimization via ANN, ELM, DBN, and BBD. With the aid of HOSVD, the optimal recipe for a holistic nutrient removal of TN, TP, and ammonia was determined to be 5% clay, 10% iron filings, 10% tire crumb, and 75% sand. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Current controllers employ discrete locomotion modes for well-defined and frequently encountered scenarios such as stair ascent, stair descent, or ramps. Non-standard movements such as side-shuffling into cars and avoiding obstacles are challenging to powered limb users. Human locomotion is a continuous motion comprising rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements, fluidly adapting to the environment. It exhibits strong inter-joint coordination and the movement of a single joint can be largely predicted based on the movement of the rest of the body. We explore a continuous and unified kinematics estimation strategy for a wide variety of movements without the need for labeled examples. Our data-driven approach uses natural body motion from the intact limbs and trunk to generate a kinematic reference trajectory for prosthetic joints. Wearable sensors were worn by 63 subjects without disabilities to record full-body kinematics during typical scenarios (flat ground and stairs), and non-rhythmic and atypical movements (side shuffles, weaving through cones, backward walking). A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was trained to predict right ankle and knee kinematics from the kinematics of other joints as inputs. Results were assessed on 3 different test subjects previously unseen by the network. All predictions had a RMSE of less than 7.5 degrees and a high correlation across activities. These offline predictions were robust to subject-specific variations such as walking speed and step length. Additionally, to test the feasibility of using a data-driven reference towards prosthetic control in real-time, a systems test was designed with a single participant. The controller acquired live kinematics, generated predictions using a pre-trained neural network, and demonstrated the capability to actuate the knee joint of a powered prosthesis for the treadmill walking task.

In this work, a 405 nm violet SLD device is fabricated with an 8 degrees tilted facet at one end of the waveguide based on InGaN/GaN quantum wells. The device has an optical power of 14.67 mW under continuous-wave operation. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the SLD at 400 mA is 12.52 nm, which is significantly larger than that in a violet laser diode (LD). Using the SLD as transmitter in VLC system, a high data transmission rate of 3.299 Gbps has been achieved using the discrete multiple tone (DMT) modulation. The corresponding bit error ratio (BER) is measured to be 1.67 x 10-3, which satisfies the forward error correction (FEC) threshold of 3.8 x 10-3. The results suggest that such device can be used as a promising light source for VLC and light fidelity (LiFi) applications. Visible light communication (VLC) based on superluminescent diode (SLD) is a promising technology with great potential for future 6G optical wireless network.

Design and simulation of array cells for image intensity transformation and coding used in mixed image processors and neural networks	OPTICS AND PHOTONICS FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING XII	Proceedings of SPIE				12th Conference of Optics and Photonics for Information Processing	AUG 19-20, 2018	San Diego, CA	SPIE				The paper considers results of design and simulation of continuously logical cells (CLC) based on current mirrors (CM) with functions of preliminary analogue processing for image intensity transformation and coding for construction of mixed image processors (IP) and neural networks (NN). For such IP and NN with vector or matrix parallel inputs-outputs, it is needed active basic photosensitive cells with an extended electronic circuit, which are considered in paper. Such CLC has a number of advantages: high speed and reliability, simplicity, small power consumption, high integration level for linear and matrix structures. We show design of CLC variants for photocurrents transformation and coding and their various possible implementations and simulations. The basic element of such cells is a scheme that implements the operation of a bounded difference of continuous logic. Using a set of such circuits implemented on traditional CMOS technology, we consider generalized decomposition and other methods for designing cells for nonlinear conversion of the photocurrent intensity, which makes it easy to realize the required nonlinear conversion function. Selection of the appropriate parameters, which can be specified as constructive constants or as parameters for external control, allows changing type of synthesized functions. We also consider the applications of such parallel matrix arrays for the creation of advanced IP and NN. We show the need for various types of converting and coding the photocurrents intensity in such parallel systems and sensory devices, especially for the implementation of various types of activation functions in the hardware implementations of neural networks. Such cells consist of several dozen CMOS transistors, have low power supply voltage (1.8 divided by 3.3V), the range of an input photocurrent is 0.1o24 mu A, the transformation time is less than 1 mu s, low power consumption (microwatts). We also consider the cells for ADC after the intensity conversion. Each channel consists of several digital-analog cells (DC). The amount of DC is not exclusive to the number of digits of the formed code, and for an iteration type, only one cell of DC, complemented by the device of selection and holding (SHD), is required. One channel of ADC with iteration is based on one DC and SHD, and it has only 35 CMOS transistors. The general power consumption of the ADC with iteration is only 50 divided by 100 mu W, if the maximum input current is 4 mu A. The ADCs with 6-8 bit binary or Gray codes have good dynamic characteristics (frequency of digitization even for 1.5 mu m CMOS-technologies is 10MHz and more). In such ADCs, easily parallel code can be realized. The circuits and the simulation results of their design with OrCAD are shown. The CLC and ADC on current mirrors open new prospects for realization of linear and matrix IP and NN with MIMO-operands.

An approach to the distributionally robust shortest path problem	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												In this study we consider the shortest path problem, where the arc costs are subject to distributional uncertainty. Basically, the decision-maker attempts to minimize her worst-case expected loss over an ambiguity set (or a family) of candidate distributions that are consistent with the decision-maker's initial information. The ambiguity set is formed by all distributions that satisfy prescribed linear first-order moment constraints with respect to subsets of arcs and individual probability constraints with respect to particular arcs. Under some additional assumptions the resulting distributionally robust shortest path problem (DRSPP) admits equivalent robust and mixed-integer programming (MIP) reformulations. The robust reformulation is shown to be NP-hard, whereas the problem without the first-order moment constraints is proved to be polynomially solvable. We perform numerical experiments to illustrate the advantages of the considered approach; we also demonstrate that the MIP reformulation of DRSPP can be solved effectively using off-the-shelf solvers.

In order to give a comprehensive characterization of malicious threats against communication networks, a generic model is presented to take into account both random false data injection attacks (FDIAs) and replay attacks. The main objective of the problem under study is to design a control protocol via output feedback such that, despite the existence of mixed attacks, all the individual agents can be driven to reside within a desired ellipsoidal region in a pre-specified probability. Sufficient conditions are provided for the existence of the requested controller and the feedback gains are formulated in terms of the solution to certain matrix inequalities. Within the established framework, two optimization problems are considered with the aim to ensure the sub-optimal consensus performances from different perspectives. Finally, a simulation example is employed to illustrate the validity of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve this maximization are given. These conditions are employed in an algorithm to achieve the maximization. New versions of the algorithm are given that are proven to achieve convergence in N or fewer steps whether the direct link is completely blocked or not, where N is the number of the RIS elements, whereas previously published results achieve this in KN or 2N number of steps where K is the number of discrete phases. Thus, for a discrete-phase RIS, the techniques presented in this paper achieve the optimum received power in the smallest number of steps published in the literature. In addition, in each of those N steps, the techniques presented in this paper determine only one or a small number of phase shifts with a simple elementwise update rule, which result in a substantial reduction of computation time, as compared to the algorithms in the literature. As a secondary result, we define the uniform polar quantization (UPQ) algorithm which is an intuitive quantization algorithm that can approximate the continuous solution with an approximation ratio of sinc(2)(1/K) and achieve low time-complexity, given perfect knowledge of the channel.																				2644-125X					2024	5						2706	2722		10.1109/OJCOMS.2024.3386559	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2024.3386559													WOS:001218692900005
J	Biedermann, DH; Clever, J; Borrmann, A				Biedermann, Daniel H.; Clever, Jan; Borrmann, Andre			A generic and density-sensitive method for multi-scale pedestrian dynamics	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION												The simulation of pedestrian dynamics is required for a wide range of applications, including crowd management, evacuation scenarios, and the design of buildings. Microscopic simulators are based on the simulation of individual agents and their mutual interactions. In comparison to macroscopic simulators that are based on network-flow models, microscopic simulators are capable of resolving movement patterns and potentially risky situations more precisely thanks to the modeling of individual behaviour, however, with the cost of much higher computational effort. Regarding the spatial resolution, microscopic simulators are either based on continuous (SpaceCont) or discrete (SpaceDisc) approaches. Whereas in the former, a pedestrian can take any position in the continuous space, in the latter, space is discretized into cells, thus restricting the possible positions of a person. SpaceDisc approaches are less precise, but computationally more efficient and thus typically applied in scenarios with a large number of persons or expanded simulation areas, respectively. For many applications, the spatial resolution of a discrete model is sufficient for observing the phenomena in question. However, in situations with high densities or small-scale obstacles, a continuous model is necessary to obtain realistic results. To combine the advantages of both approaches, we propose to integrate SpaceCont and SpaceDisc into a hybrid simulation model. Such a hybrid approach allows simulating critical regions with a continuous spatial resolution and uncritical ones with discrete spatial resolution while enabling consistent information exchange between the two simulation models. We introduce a generic approach that provides consistent solutions for the challenges resulting from coupling diverging time steps and spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic and density-sensitive approach to detect dense areas during the simulation run. If a critical region is detected, the simulation model used in this area is dynamically switched to a space-continuous one. The correctness of the hybrid model is evaluated by comparison with the simulation results of other, well-established simulation models.

These broadcasters are likely to gain greater attention if their posts can remain visible for a longer period of time among their followers' most recent feeds. Then when to post? In this paper, we study the problem of smart broadcasting using the framework of temporal point processes, where we model users feeds and posts as discrete events occurring in continuous time. Based on such continuous time model, then choosing a broadcasting strategy for a user becomes a problem of designing the conditional intensity of her posting events. We derive a novel formula which links this conditional intensity with the "visibility" of the user in her followers' feeds. Furthermore, by exploiting this formula, we develop an efficient convex optimization framework for the "when-to-post" problem. Our method can find broadcasting strategies that reach a desired "visibility" level with provable guarantees. We experimented with data gathered from Twitter, and show that our framework can consistently make broadcasters' post more visible than alternatives.

This method builds on the existing deep model called Holistically-Defined Edge Detection (HED), which was shown to perform better than other information theory and convolutional network techniques for edge detection. Though HED outperforms techniques such as Canny Edge detection, HED's performance is based on it being trained on natural images with very little noise. Weather-related backscatter profiles, such as those generated from LIDAR-based ceilometers, often contain noise. In addition, there is often less of a difference in the pixel density between edges and non-edges, and due to atmospheric dynamics, continuous edges are not always detected in the images. Under these conditions when using HED, subtle but useful edges are lost from side outputs during the fusing process while the network is being trained. Canny Edge detection also does not perform well under these conditions, as it determines edges based on the differences in pixel density. We describe a new edge detection deep network developed specifically for overcoming these issues by applying physics-aware attention mechanisms to the side outputs of the HED learning process. We show how this method is able to learn the subtle edges as opposed to HED or Canny, when used to identify planetary boundary layer heights which involves distinguishing the mixing layer, residual layer, and nocturnal layer in addition to the cloud heights for ceilometer-based backscatter. Though the intent of this network is to learn planetary boundary layer heights and cloud heights, this method could be applied to other weather-related phenomena and applied to backscatter imagery generated from other sources such as satellites.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-4563-9; 978-1-5106-4562-2				2021	11859								1185908	10.1117/12.2600327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2600327													WOS:000893739400005

The control input of each agent is based on the information of its neighbors at discrete sampling instants rather than the whole continuous process. An input delay approach is utilized to transform the sampling data into the time-varying delayed data. A novel time-dependent Lyapunov functional consisting of the continuous term and the discontinuous term is proposed. Tools like matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, relaxed matrix approach, and convex analysis technique are utilized to derive the sufficient conditions. The estimated upper bound of the sampling interval can be obtained by the proposed conditions. Then, the necessary and sufficient conditions for consensus in systems with linear dynamics are presented. It is shown that the consensus conditions depend on the parameters of the sampling interval, spectra of the Laplacian matrix, and coupling strength. The effectiveness of the proposed design method is demonstrated by the simulation examples.

We call them respectively short-term demands and long-term demands. In this paper, we propose a novel self-attentive Continuous-Time Recommendation model (CTRec) for capturing the evolving demands of users over time. For modeling such time-sensitive demands, a Demand-aware Hawkes Process (DHP) framework is designed in CTRec to learn from the discrete purchase records of users. More specifically, a convolutional neural network is utilized to capture the short-term demands; and a self-attention mechanism is employed to capture the periodical purchase cycles of long-term demands. All types of demands are fused in DHP to make final continuous-time recommendations. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world commercial datasets to demonstrate that CTRec is effective for general sequential recommendation problems, including next-item and next-session/basket recommendations. We observe in particular that CTRec is capable of learning the purchase cycles of products and estimating the purchase time of a product given a user.					li, yong/HDN-3885-2022; Zou, Lixin/AIE-3713-2022; Bai, Ting/ACY-8306-2022; Nie, Jian-Yun/AEA-4243-2022	Nie, Jian-Yun/0000-0003-1556-3335															978-1-4503-6172-9				2019							675	684		10.1145/3331184.3331199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331199													WOS:000501488900070

Methods: Medline and Scopus databases were searched from inception to 29 August 2014, using PubMed and Scopus search engines and included RCTs or quasi-experimental designs comparing clinical outcomes between treatments. Data were extracted from original studies. A network meta-analysis was performed by applying weight regression for continuous outcomes and a mixed-effect Poisson regression for dichotomous outcomes. Results: Thirty-one of 505 identified studies were eligible. Compared to placebo, glucosamine showed a significant improvement with unstandardized mean differences (UMD) in total WOMAC, pain WOMAC, function WOMAC, and Lequesne score of -2.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.14, -0.83), -0.75 (95% CI: -1.18, -0.32), -4.78 (95% CI: -5.96, -3.59), and -1.03 (95% CI: -1.34, -0.72), respectively. Diacerein clinically improves visual analog scores, function WOMAC, and stiffness WOMAC with UMD values of -2.23 (95% CI: -2.82, -1.64), -6.64 (95% CI: -10.50, -2.78), and -0.68 (95% CI: -1.20, -0.16) when compared to placebo. Conclusions: The network meta-analysis suggests that diacerein and glucosamine are equally efficacious for symptom relief in knee OA, but that the former has more side effects.

The MASs are given in a continuous-time setting while information exchange occurs only at the sampling instants. Therefore, the traditional methods for continuous-time or discrete-time models are not applicable. To resolve the problem, a discretization-reconnection method is developed to investigate the consensus control of first-order and second-order MASs, respectively. Some sufficient conditions, explicitly related to the control gains and the sampling step size, are established for both mean-square (m.s.) and almost sure (a.s.) consensus. Under these conditions, consensus can be achieved by designing appropriate control gains and the sampling step size for MASs with given noise intensity and time-delays. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In our solutions each agent is endowed with a local criterion that enables it to determine whether to broadcast its state to its neighbors. Our starting point is a continuous-time distributed coordination strategy that, under continuous-time communication, achieves practical asymptotic tracking of the dynamic average of the time-varying agents' reference inputs. Then, for this algorithm, depending on the directed or undirected nature of the time-varying interactions and under suitable connectivity conditions, we propose two different distributed event-triggered communication laws that prescribe agent communications at discrete time instants in an opportunistic fashion. In both cases, we establish positive lower bounds on the inter-event times of each agent and characterize their dependence on the algorithm design parameters. This analysis allows us to rule out the presence of Zeno behavior and characterize the asymptotic correctness of the resulting implementations. Several simulations illustrate the results.

By aggregating neighboring feature values on the image grid, pooling layers downsample feature maps while maintaining accuracy. In standard vision transformers, however, tokens are processed individually and do not necessarily lie on regular grids. Utilizing pooling methods designed for image grids (e.g., average pooling) thus can be sub-optimal for transformers, as shown by our experiments. In this paper, we propose Token Pooling to downsample token sets in vision transformers. We take a new perspective - instead of assuming tokens form a regular grid, we treat them as discrete (and irregular) samples of an implicit continuous signal. Given a target number of tokens, Token Pooling finds the set of tokens that best approximates the underlying continuous signal. We rigorously evaluate the proposed method on the standard transformer architecture (ViT/DeiT) and on the image classification problem using ImageNet-1k. Our experiments show that Token Pooling significantly improves the computation-accuracy trade-off without any further modifications to the architecture. Token Pooling enables DeiT-Ti to achieve the same top-1 accuracy while using 42% fewer computations.																			2472-6737		978-1-6654-9346-8				2023							12	21		10.1109/WACV56688.2023.00010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WACV56688.2023.00010													WOS:000971500200002

Centrifugation and index matching yield a strong and transparent bioinspired nacreous composite	SCIENCE												Glasses have numerous applications because of their exceptional transparency and stiffness; however, poor fracture, impact resistance, and mechanical reliability limit the range of their applications. Recent bioinspired glasses have shown superior mechanical performance, but they still suffer from reduced optical quality. Here, we present a nacreous glass composite that offers a combination of strength, toughness, and transparency. Micrometer-sized glass tablets and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were mixed and structured by centrifugation, creating dense PMMA-glass layers.

J	Wang, YW; Yi, JW				Wang, Yan-Wu; Yi, Jing-Wen			Consensus in second-order multi-agent systems via impulsive control using position-only information with heterogeneous delays	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												This study investigates the consensus problem of second-order multi-agent systems (MASs) via impulsive control using position-only information with communication delays. The communication delays between any two distinct agents are different which can be larger than one impulsive period. A distributed impulsive consensus protocol is designed, in which only the delayed sampled relative positions to neighbours and the relative position to the last sampling state are utilised. By introducing some virtual subgraphs and performing three steps of model transformation, the consensus problem of original continuous-time system is converted to the stability problem of a discrete-time expanded error system. Some necessary and sufficient criteria are derived to grantee the dynamic average-consensus of the MAS. Furthermore, a special case, that is, the delays less than one impulsive period, is discussed, and the bounds of impulsive periods for the dynamic average-consensus are obtained in explicit expressions for both the undirected and directed communication graphs, respectively. Two numerical simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				FEB 5	2015	9	3			SI		336	345		10.1049/iet-cta.2014.0425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2014.0425													WOS:000350213100005
J	Yüksel, S; Basar, T				Yueksel, Serdar; Basar, Tamer			Control Over Noisy Forward and Reverse Channels	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												We consider the problem of remotely controlling a continuous-time linear time-invariant system driven by Brownian motion process, when communication takes place over noisy memoryless discrete-or continuous-alphabet channels. What makes this class of remote control problems different from most of the previously studied models is the presence of noise in both the forward channel (connecting sensors to the controller) and the reverse channel (connecting the controller to the plant). For stability of the closed-loop system, we look for the existence of an invariant distribution for the state, for which we show that it is necessary that the entire control space and the state space be encoded, and that the reverse channel be at least as reliable as the forward channel. We obtain necessary conditions and sufficient conditions on the channels and the controllers for stabilizability. Using properties of the underlying sampled Markov chain, we show that under variable-length coding and some realistic channel conditions, stability can be achieved over discrete-alphabet channels even if the entire state and control spaces are to be encoded and the number of bits that can be transmitted per unit time is strictly bounded. For control over continuous-alphabet channels, however, a variable rate scheme is not necessary. We also show that memoryless policies are rate-efficient for Gaussian channels.

J	Pola, G; De Santis, E; Di Benedetto, MD				Pola, Giordano; De Santis, Elena; Di Benedetto, Maria Domenica			Approximate current state observability of discrete-time nonlinear systems under cyber-attacks	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS												Widespread use of the Internet and other means of communication has increased the risk of cyber-attacks that can affect the warranted operation of a system. To prevent damages from attacks, an assessment of its security plays an important role in providing fast and reliable solutions. This paper focuses on state estimation of nonlinear systems under attacks. We consider a plant represented by a discrete-time nonlinear system and an attacker modeled as a finite state machine. We propose a novel notion of observability, called approximate current state observability under attacks, which corresponds to the possibility of identifying the current state of the plant after a given transient despite the malicious action of an attacker that can replace the plant output symbols in the communication network infrastructure. To provide conditions for this property to hold, we resort to the use of formal methods and in particular, of symbolic models. Symbolic models provide an abstract description of purely continuous systems, where a symbolic state corresponds to an aggregate of continuous states in the original system. The approach we propose is particularly useful when dealing with cyber-security of continuous processes in that it offers a framework to deal with the heterogeneous models of the plant and the attacker. An academic example showing the applicability of the results presented is included.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, YB; Liu, KP; Wang, G; Sun, ZB; Jin, L				Liu, Yongbai; Liu, Keping; Wang, Gang; Sun, Zhongbo; Jin, Long			Noise-tolerant zeroing neurodynamic algorithm for upper limb motion intention-based human-robot interaction control in non-ideal conditions	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												Human-robot interaction control, a crucial technology in industrial manufacturing and rehabilitation robot, has been widely explored in recent years. However, there are still some problems in the existing strategy need to be solved for the rehabilitation robot: First, the human-robot confrontation (HRC) in motion control affects the information interaction. Second, in non-ideal conditions, the safety and accuracy of the control system will be disturbed by external unknown factors. Third, the existing continuous-time controllers are hard to be applied to hardware platforms. In this paper, an upper limb-exoskeleton coupling dynamics model based on human active motion intention is established to overcome HRC, and promote active and natural human-robot interaction control. Specifically, the Elman neural network (ENN) model is devised and utilized to estimate human active motion intention using the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. On the basis of human active motion intention, the discrete-time controller predicated on noise-tolerant zeroing neurodynamic model (termed as NTZND controller) is proposed for constructing the discrete-time human-robot interaction control system (DTHRICS) under non-ideal conditions. In addition, the zeroing neurodynamic (ZND) controller, the gradient neural network (GNN) and proportional-derivative (PD) controllers are designed for comparisons. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that the 0-stability, consistency and convergence of the designed DTHRICS. The performance indicators root mean square errors (RMSEs) and coefficient of determination (R2) of the DTHRICS with different controllers are analyzed and compared under ideal and non-ideal conditions. Ultimately, numerical results illustrate that the NTZND-based DTHRICS (with the lowest performance RMSEs-* 0 and the highest performance R2-* 1, p < 0.05) is significantly superior to the DTHRICS with the ZND, the GNN and the PD controllers in terms of control accuracy, noise-tolerant property and real time performance, while utilized for upper limb multi-joint motion control under non-ideal conditions.

Improved delay-dependent stability criteria for neutral systems with mixed interval time-varying delays and nonlinear disturbances	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												It is well-known that the stability analysis of time-delay systems is a key step to design appropriate controllers and/or filters for those systems. In this paper, the problem of the delay-dependent stability analysis of neutral systems with mixed interval time-varying delays with/without nonlinear perturbations is revisited. Bounded derivatives of the discrete and neutral delays with upper-bounds not limited to be strictly less than one are considered. New stability criteria are developed using the Lyapunov Krasovskii methodology which are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An augmented Lyapunov Krasovskii functional (LKF) utilizing triple integral terms and the descriptor transformation is employed to this aim. In addition, advanced techniques such as Wirtinger-based single and double-integral inequalities, delay decomposition technique combined with the reciprocally convex approach, as well as a few effective free-weighting matrices are employed to achieve less conservative stability conditions. Comprehensive benchmarking numerical examples and simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability criteria with respect to some recently published results. The efficacy of the modern integral inequalities are also emphasized against the conventional.Tensen's inequalities. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The electrical percolation threshold was obtained between 0.5 and 1 wt% MWNTs as manifested by a dramatic increase in the electrical conductivity by about six orders of magnitude with respect to the neat blends. In order to further enhance the electrical conductivity of the blends, the MWNTs were modified with amine terminated ionic liquid (IL), which, besides enhancing the interfacial interaction with PVDF, facilitated the formation of a network like structure of MWNTs. This high electrical conductivity of the blends, at a relatively low fraction (1 wt%), was further explored to design materials that can attenuate electromagnetic (EM) radiation. More specifically, to attenuate the EM radiation by absorption, a ferroelectric phase was introduced. To accomplish this, barium titanate (BT) nanoparticles chemically stitched onto graphene oxide (GO) sheets were synthesized and mixed along with MWNTs in the blends. Intriguingly, the total EM shielding effectiveness (SE) was enhanced by ca. 10 dB with respect to the blends with only MWNTs. In addition, the effect of introducing a ferromagnetic phase (Fe3O4) along with IL modified MWNTs was also investigated. This study opens new avenues in designing materials that can attenuate EM radiation by selecting either a ferroelectric (BT-GO) or a ferromagnetic phase (Fe3O4) along with intrinsically conducting nanoparticles (MWNTs).

J	Guo, L; Jia, J; Chen, J; Du, A; Wang, XW				Guo, Liang; Jia, Jie; Chen, Jian; Du, An; Wang, Xingwei			Deep reinforcement learning empowered joint mode selection and resource allocation for RIS-aided D2D communications	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS												Device-to-device (D2D) communication has been regarded as a promising solution to alleviate the mobile traffic explosion problem for its capabilities of improving system data rate and resource utilization. A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided mobile D2D communications framework is investigated, where the RIS is deployed to improve communication quality. As the transmission distance of D2D pairs changes, the mode selection for D2D pairs and the phase shift design for RIS is essential for mobile scenarios. Therefore, we formulate a joint optimization problem of mode selection, channel assignment, power allocation, and discrete phase shift selection to maximize the average sum data rate of D2D pairs. This problem is also constrained by the maximum transmit power and the minimum data rate requirements of users, where the latter is to guarantee the fairness of D2D pairs. We first reformulate the original sequential decision-making problem into a Markov game (MG) problem to solve the challenging optimization. Furthermore, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework is proposed, in which multiple agents cooperatively determine the joint mode selection and resource allocation strategy. The proposed MADRL-based framework combines both the multi-pass deep Q-networks (MP-DQN) algorithm and the decaying DQN algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Specifically, we adopt the MP-DQN algorithm for D2D pairs to handle the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Moreover, the decaying DQN algorithm is invoked by the RIS agent to select discrete phase shifts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge under different cases. The proposed MADRL-based algorithm outperforms the combination algorithm of DQN and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) in terms of system performance. Moreover, it is also shown that the average sum data rate of D2D pairs can be significantly improved by deploying the RIS and further enhanced by increasing the number of reflecting elements (REs).

A mechanically actuated inline three-piston variable displacement digital pump was previously proposed and designed. The inline three-piston pump incorporates complex mechanical and hydraulic subsystems and highly coupled mechanisms. The complexity of the utilized subsystems poses challenges when assessing the viability of the conceptual design. Therefore, this work focuses on designing, developing, and implementing a collaborative virtual platform involving a digitized module showcasing the internal mechanical structure of the digital pump utilizing mixed reality (MR) technology. MR technology is acknowledged as the forthcoming evolution of the human-machine interface in the real-virtual environment utilizing computers and wearables. This technology permits running simulations that examine the complexity of highly coupled systems, like the digital pump, where understanding the physical phenomenon is far too intricate. The developed MR platform permits multiple users to collaborate in a synchronized immersive MR environment to study and analyze the applicability of the pump's design and the adequacy of the operated mechanisms. The collaborative MR platform was designed and developed on the Unity game engine, employing Microsoft Azure and Photon Unity Networking to set up the synchronized MR environment. The platform involves a fully interactive virtual module on the digital pump design, developed in multiple stages using Microsoft's Mixed Reality Tool Kit (MRTK) for Unity and deployed in the synchronized MR environment through a HoloLens 2 MR headset. A research study involving 71 participants was carried out at Purdue University. The study's objective was to explore the impact of the collaborative MR environment on understanding the complexity and operation of the digital pump. It also sought to assess the effectiveness of MR in facilitating collaboration among fluid power stakeholders in a synchronized digital reality setting to study, diagnose, and control their complex systems. Surveys were designed and completed by all 71 participants after experiencing the MR platform. The results indicate that approximately 75% of the participants expressed positive attitudes toward their overall MR platform experience, with particular appreciation for its immersive nature and the synchronized collaborative environment it provided. More than 70% of the participants agreed that the pump's collaborative MR platform was essential for studying and understanding the complexity and intricacy of the digital pump's mechanical structure. Overall, the results demonstrate that the MR platform effectively facilitates the visualization of the complex pump's internal structure, inspection of the assembly of each of the involved subsystems, and testing the applicability of the complicated mechanisms.

Recently, continuous aperture RIS is proved to have better communication performance than discrete aperture RIS and has received much attention. However, the conventional continuous aperture RIS is designed to convert the incoming planar waves into the outgoing planar waves, which is not the optimal reflecting scheme when the receiver is not a planar array and is located in the near field of the RIS. In this paper, we consider two types of receivers in the radiating near field of the RIS: (1) when the receiver is equipped with a uniform linear array (ULA), we design RIS coefficient to convert planar waves into cylindrical waves; (2) when the receiver is equipped with a single antenna, we design RIS coefficient to convert planar waves into spherical waves. We then propose the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the focal scanning (FS) method to sense the location of the receiver based on the analytic expression of the reflection coefficient, and derive the corresponding position error bound (PEB). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce energy leakage and thus enlarge the channel capacity compared to the conventional scheme. Moreover, the location of the receiver could be accurately sensed by the ML method with large computation complexity or be roughly sensed by the FS method with small computation complexity.

Restricted dispersal in a sea of gene flow	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												How far do marine larvae disperse in the ocean? Decades of population genetic studies have revealed generally low levels of genetic structure at large spatial scales (hundreds of kilometres). Yet this result, typically based on discrete sampling designs, does not necessarily imply extensive dispersal. Here, we adopt a continuous sampling strategy along 950 km of coast in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea to address this question in four species. In line with expectations, we observe weak genetic structure at a large spatial scale. Nevertheless, our continuous sampling strategy uncovers a pattern of isolation by distance at small spatial scales (few tens of kilometres) in two species. Individual-based simulations indicate that this signal is an expected signature of restricted dispersal. At the other extreme of the connectivity spectrum, two pairs of individuals that are closely related genetically were found more than 290 km apart, indicating long-distance dispersal. Such a combination of restricted dispersal with rare long-distance dispersal events is supported by a high-resolution biophysical model of larval dispersal in the study area, and we posit that it may be common in marine species. Our results bridge population genetic studies with direct dispersal studies and have implications for the design of marine reserve networks.

Simultaneous Fault Detection and Control Design for a Network of Multi-agent Systems	2014 EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)					13th European Control Conference (ECC)	JUN 24-27, 2014	Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, FRANCE	ICube lab, MathWorks, Groupement Rech Modeling, Anal & Control Dynam Syst, Siemens, Natl Ctr Sci Res, INRIA	Univ Strasbourg			The problem of simultaneous fault detection and control (SFDC) of linear continuous-time multi-agent systems is addressed in this paper. A mixed H-infinity/H- formulation of the SFDC problem by using distributed detection filters subject to only relative output measurements is presented. Using our proposed methodology, all agents reach a model reference consensus while simultaneously the agents collaborate with one another to detect the occurrence of faults in the team. Indeed, each agent not only can detect its own fault but also is capable of detecting its neighbor's faults. It is shown that through a decomposition approach the computational complexity of solving the problem is effectively reduced. The extended linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is used to reduce the conservativeness of the SFDC results by introducing additional matrix variables to eliminate the couplings of Lyapunov matrices with the system matrices. Simulation results corresponding to a team of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of the proposed design methodology.

Optimal retrofit of moment resisting frames using braces accounting for geometric nonlinearity and serviceability conditions	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES												The paper proposes three novel optimal retrofitting strategies for moment resisting frames using cross braces to satisfy given serviceability limitations. The influences of 2nd-order geometric effects are included. The well-known "ground structure" method is used to generate an initial network of possible brace layouts and automatically determine the best one using an optimization algorithm. Of special note is the use of a constraint to impose a realistic design criterion, in which a brace can be selected only if its area lies within specified bound limits. This in effect eliminates members with non-practical (too small) sizes. The formulation is cast as a challenging instance of a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which accommodates simultaneously continuous and binary variables. A two-step optimization algorithm is proposed as an efficient and robust solution approach. The safety and integrity of the retrofitted structures are assessed using step-by-step nonlinear elastic analyses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In reality, multiple UAVs take-off and landing sites, energy consumption, and other complex issues closely related to USV recovery, UAVs must be considered. If mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is used directly, it is difficult to get satisfactory results in an acceptable time range. Therefore, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of data collection by these devices, which can not only quickly solve the large-scale collaborative optimization problem, but also rationally utilize the total energy consumption of the equipment. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified and analyzed by experimenting a different number of monitoring nodes, different number of UAVs and different task time. It can not only shorten the cycle of data acquisition task, but also reduce the waiting time of the UAV and USV.

In this paper, a time-varying extremum seeking control (TVESC) for discrete -time systems is utilized in a distributed and a collaborative manner. Each controller monitors the actions of a wind turbine and the objective is to maximize the farm wide power capture. To address this task, the distributed controllers ensure that the turbines share local information over an undirected connected communication network. Also, with the use of a discretized version of a continuous -time dynamic average consensus estimator, the controllers help the turbines estimate the mean of the overall power generated in the wind farm. The dynamics of each turbine power estimate is parameterized and the unknown gradient is estimated as a time-varying parameter using a tailored estimation routine. This information is used in the design of the extremum seeking controller. The problem to be solved is addressed via numerical simulations, results are provided to show the effectiveness of this technique.

Our goal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS and the passive beamforming at the IRS, subject to successive interference cancellation decoding rate conditions and IRS reflecting elements constraints. In term of the characteristics of reflection amplitudes and phase shifts, we consider ideal and non-ideal IRS assumptions. To tackle the formulated non-convex problems, we propose efficient algorithms by invoking alternating optimization, which design the active beamforming and passive beamforming alternately. For the ideal IRS scenario, the two subproblems are solved by invoking the successive convex approximation technique. For the non-ideal IRS scenario, constant modulus IRS elements are further divided into continuous phase shifts and discrete phase shifts. To tackle the passive beamforming problem with continuous phase shifts, a novel algorithm is developed by utilizing the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation approach, which is guaranteed to find a locally optimal rank-one solution. Then, a quantization-based scheme is proposed for discrete phase shifts. Finally, numerical results illustrate that: i) the system sum rate can be significantly improved by deploying the IRS with the proposed algorithms; ii) 3-bit phase shifters are capable of achieving almost the same performance as the ideal IRS; iii) the proposed IRS-aided NOMA systems achieve higher system sum rate than the IRS-aided orthogonal multiple access system.

Firstly, based on the cognitive learning theory, the cognitive driving behavior model is established, and then the cognitive driving behavior is described and analyzed. Next, based on ANNI, the model and the rule extraction algorithm (ANNI-REA) are designed to explain not only the driving behavior but also the non-sequence. Rules have high fidelity and safety during driving without discretizing continuous input variables. The experimental results on the UCI standard data set and on the self-built driving behavior data set, show that the method is about 0.4% more accurate and about 10% less complex than the common C4.5-REA, Neuro-Rule and REFNE. Further, simulation experiments verify the correctness of the extracted driving rules and the effectiveness of the extraction based on cognitive driving behavior rules. In general, the several driving rules extracted fully reflect the execution mechanism of sequential activity of driving comprehensive cognition, which is of great significance for the traffic of mixed traffic flow under the network of vehicles and future research on unmanned driving.					long, chen/JVM-8568-2024; Zhao, Yucheng/JYP-8261-2024	Zhao, yucheng/0000-0003-1286-2540													2095-2899	2227-5223				JAN	2020	27	1					164	179		10.1007/s11771-020-4286-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11771-020-4286-1													WOS:000511537800015

Novel sensors for human biomedical signal together with wireless connectivity and low power solutions are creating new opportunities for wearable devices which allow continuous monitoring together with freedom of movement of the users. This paper presents a low-power wearable sensor networks platform for on-body physiological measurements and wireless data communications. The platform hosts novel high sensitivity electric potential dry surface sensors that can be used in either contact or non-contact mode to measure ECG and EMG signals. Heart rate and respiration rate is performed runtime directly on the node. This approach reduces the amount of data than need to be transmitted, from raw measurement to analyzed data. In doing so the duty cycle of the radio has been reduced and the power consumption of the node optimized. Experimental measurements show the acquisition and processing of data from sensors and the low power consumption achieved with the node in different modalities.

In this paper, we study a fog radio access network (F-RAN) consisting of enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs) with multiple antennas and edge computing capabilities. The F-RAN simultaneously supports task offloading of computing users (CUs) and energy harvesting of energy users (EUs). Thanks to the global coordination of a central server, full cooperation among eRRHs in both computing and communication domains can substantially improve the SWOPT performance. Specifically, the energy harvesting performance of EUs is maximised by jointly optimising the bandwidth and the beam resources in the communication domain as well as the computing frequency and the offloading strategy in the computing domain. The original non-convex problem with mixed integer and continuous variables is then solved by sequential convex optimisations in the framework of a greedy algorithm with low complexity. Thorough simulation results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed resource scheduling scheme over the existing state-of-the-art counterparts.					xiang, luping/KIK-7852-2024	Shui, Tingyu/0000-0003-1803-6469													0090-6778	1558-0857				JAN	2023	71	1					269	281		10.1109/TCOMM.2022.3225440	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2022.3225440													WOS:000967170800001

However, the dynamics along this path are still not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the linkage patterns and incremental evolution of domain knowledge structure from the perspective of structure deconstruction. To this end, we proposed a novel framework that integrates the incremental update mechanism of knowledge network construction, subgraph enumeration, and knowledge combination. The proposed integrative framework enables us to embed time-related node attributes into identified subgraphs and to deconstruct specific types of decomposable structure into exiting knowledge combinations and potential knowledge combinations. Results from our case studies, the IIoT and the Metaverse fields, confirmed that the proposed framework is applicable to reveal the underlying knowledge linkage patterns and relative evolution strength. The identified decomposable structures suggest that the path toward knowledge linkages mainly follows a mixed strategy (e.g., high impact knowledge elements are more likely to be linked with elements of middle/low level of impact). The framework designed in this study, together with findings from two fields, elucidates specific evolutionary dynamics through a combined analysis of motifs and structural deconstruction. These findings hold implications for practitioners and policymakers seeking to develop a nuanced understanding of the field.																			0138-9130	1588-2861				2024 JUN 14	2024										10.1007/s11192-024-05059-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-024-05059-3		JUN 2024											WOS:001246522000002

An example for such a kind of a network is Internet. New service is emerging, and it is a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). An important aspect of packet-switched voice is the reconstruction of a continuous stream of speech from the set of packets that arrive at the destination DTE. Because of the statistical nature of packet switching, each packet can encounter a different amount of delay in traversing a packet network. The problem described in this paper is how to design an appropriate voice reconstruction strategy that reproduces acceptable quality speech from packets that arrive with varying delay. The basic idea proposed in the paper is to measure a delay jitter between several points on the Internet. Our voice traffic generator, implemented on a workstation, sends packets that are 20ms long. Receiver measures interarrival time, keeps track of mixed sequences and lost packets. The measurement results are given in a form of average delay jitter. Receiver also keeps a record of all relevant packet information in a text file that is used as an input to a delay jitter predictor. Traffic prediction element predicts talkspurt characteristics and directly influences playout delay. For a prediction element, we propose Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS).																					1-56555-204-0				2000							521	525																WOS:000088745300091

For electric vehicle equipped with four in-wheel motors, its tire longitudinal forces can be generated independently and individually with fully utilized tire adhesion at each corner. This type of the electric vehicles has a distributed drive system, and often regarded as an over-actuated system since the number of actuators in general exceeds the control variables. Control allocation (CA) is often considered as an effective means for the control of over-actuated systems. The in-vehicle network technology has been one of the major enablers for the distributed drive systems. The vehicle studied in this research has an electrohydraulic brake system (EHB) on front axle, while an electromechanical brake system (EMB) on rear axle. The focus of this study is on the scheduling of the networked control for the distributed systems. A network control system (NCS) model is first established with a continuous-time based plant model, a discrete controller and a FlexRay communication model, in addition to the electric vehicle model with tire model and driving/braking actuator models. An integrated vehicle control allocation method based on constraints optimization is then proposed. The dynamic characteristics of each actuator are considered on the control allocation with higher-bandwidth actuators being used for faster control commands. It is also considered for the scheduling optimization of FlexRay which minimizes a cost function and subject to a set of constraints. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system is built, which consists of a driving simulator, four in-wheel motors, EHB and EMB brake systems, all connected via FlexRay communication in order to validate the proposed scheduling methods. The experimental results have demonstrated the improved responses of actuators when considering their dynamic characteristics, improved control performance via properly designed control allocation, and reduced bus efficiency via optimized scheduling methods.

According to the definitions of objective function selectivity, instantaneous selectivity, and single yield, two concentration trajectory equations are developed under two extreme cases of continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) and differential side-stream reactor (DSR) by means of their geometrical characters and those of reaction and mixing in concentration space for the Van de Vusse reaction scheme. The two equations may be regarded as the optimization criterion of maximum selectivity for the reactor system. The concept of the maximum selectivity curve is presented by extending the feed of the reactor system from pure component to arbitrary concentration. The two-dimensional concentration space is divided into three regions (CSTR region, plug-flow reactor region, and non-operation region) by the curves of maximum selectivity and maximum single yield. The property of the maximum selectivity curve is dS(R)/dx = 0, and that of the maximum single yield curve is S-R = 0. Three different regions have respectively the following properties: CSTR region, dS(R)/dx < 0, S-R > 0; PFR region, dS(R)/dx > 0, S-R > 0; non-operation region, dS(R)/dx > 0, S-R < 0. The feasible flow configuration of reactor networks can be conveniently determined by taking advantage of the properties of different regions and their boundaries.																			0888-5885					JAN 23	2002	41	2					190	195		10.1021/ie010251w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie010251w													WOS:000173413800008
J	Jamaloei, BY				Jamaloei, Benyamin Yadali			A critical review of common models in hydraulic-fracturing simulation: A practical guide for practitioners	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FRACTURE MECHANICS												In laminated, anisotropic unconventional rocks (ultra-tight shale, tight gas, coal seam, and so forth), the true hydraulic-fracturing mode is a complex, mixed-mode process. The fracture-modeling practitioner often encounters a wide range of fracture models. The selection of an appropriate fracture model has become a daunting task with significant implications for the hydraulic-fracturing pre-treatment design or post-treatment diagnostic evaluation. Therefore, it is crucial to properly identify the assumptions and limitations of each model, and how they affect the modeling output as well as the treatment design. This study provides a critical review of the assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages of the more-common fracture models in hydraulic-fracturing simulation. The models covered range from the simplified 2D, pseudo 3D (P3D), and lumped parameter (LP) models to 3D planar-fracture models (elastically coupled and shear-decoupled models), and to more complex 3D models including the displacement discontinuity model (DDM), discrete fracture network (DFN) model, distinct element model (DEM), bonded particle model (BPM), synthetic rock mass (SRM) using BPM and smooth joint model (SJM), lattice model (including the dual-lattice implementation of SRM), continuum and extendedcontinuum models, and the meshless models. The advantages and disadvantages of the more advanced 3D models are analyzed in the context of simulating special cases, including alternate fracturing and hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured reservoirs. In the context of these special cases, the capabilities and limitations of these models in incorporating the complex interactions between the hydraulic fractures, and between hydraulic and pre-existing fractures and joints are discussed. This study outlines how a fracture model should be carefully selected, considering the geological and geomechanical conditions, availability of data, and the scope of investigation.

J	Amjath, M; Kerbache, L; Smith, JM				Amjath, Mohamed; Kerbache, Laoucine; Smith, James MacGregor			A Closed Queueing Networks Approach for an Optimal Heterogeneous Fleet Size of an Inter-Facility Bulk Material Transfer System	LOGISTICS-BASEL												Background: This study addresses optimising fleet size in a system with a heterogeneous truck fleet, aiming to minimise transportation costs in interfacility material transfer operations. Methods: The material transfer process is modelled using a closed queueing network (CQN) that considers heterogeneous nodes and customised service times tailored to the unique characteristics of various truck types and their transported materials. The optimisation problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), falling into the NP-Hard, making exact solution computation challenging. A numerical approximation method, a modified sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method coupled with a mean value analysis (MVA) algorithm, is employed to overcome this challenge. Validation is conducted using a discrete event simulation (DES) model. Results: The proposed analytical model tested within a steel manufacturing plant's material transfer process. The results showed that the analytical model achieved comparable optimisation of the heterogeneous truck fleet size with significantly reduced response times compared to the simulation method. Furthermore, evaluating performance metrics, encompassing response time, utilisation rate, and cycle time, revealed minimal discrepancies between the analytical and the simulation results, approximately +/- 8%, +/- 8%, and +/- 7%, respectively. Conclusions: These findings affirm the presented analytical approach's robustness in optimising interfacility material transfer operations with heterogeneous truck fleets, demonstrating real-world applications.

J	Blum, RS				Blum, Rick S.			Ordering for Estimation and Optimization in Energy Efficient Sensor Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING												A discretized version of a continuous optimization problem is considered for the case where data is obtained from a set of dispersed sensor nodes and the overall metric is a sum of individual metrics computed at each sensor. An example of such a problem is maximum-likelihood estimation based on statistically independent sensor observations. By ordering transmissions from the sensor nodes, a method for achieving a saving in the average number of sensor transmissions is described. While the average number of sensor transmissions is reduced, the approach always yields the same solution as the optimum approach where all sensor transmissions occur. The approach is described first for a general optimization problem. A maximum-likelihood target location and velocity estimation example for a multiple node noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system is later described. In particular, for cases with N good quality sensors with ideal signals and sufficiently large signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), the average percentage of transmissions saved approaches 100% as the number of discrete grid points in the optimization problem becomes significantly large. In these same cases, the average percentage of transmissions saved approaches (Q - 1)/Q x 100% as the number of sensors in the network becomes significantly large. Similar savings are illustrated for general optimization (or estimation) problems with some sufficiently well-designed sensors. Savings can be even larger in some cases for systems with some poor quality sensors.

J	Diniz, JAF; Telles, MPDC				Felizola Diniz Filho, Jose Alexandre; Pires de Campos Telles, Mariana			Optimization procedures for establishing reserve networks for biodiversity conservation taking into account population genetic structure	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Conservation genetics has been focused on the ecological and evolutionary persistence of targets ( species or other intraspecific units), especially when dealing with narrow-ranged species, and no generalized solution regarding the problem of where to concentrate conservation efforts for multiple genetic targets has yet been achieved. Broadly distributed and abundant species allow the identification of evolutionary significant units, management units, phylogeographical units or other spatial patterns in genetic variability, including those generated by effects of habitat fragmentation caused by human activities. However, these genetic units are rarely considered as priority conservation targets in regional conservation planning procedures. In this paper, we discuss a theoretical framework in which target persistence and genetic representation of targets defined using multiple genetic criteria can be explicitly incorporated into the broad-scale reserve network models used to optimize biodiversity conservation based on multiple species data. When genetic variation can be considered discrete in geographical space, the solution is straightforward, and each spatial unit must be considered as a distinct target. But methods for dealing with continuous genetic variation in space are not trivial and optimization procedures must still be developed. We present a simple heuristic and sequential algorithm to deal with this problem by combining multiple networks of local populations of multiple species in which minimum separation distance between conserved populations is a function of spatial autocorrelation patterns of genetic variability within each species.					de Campos Telles, Mariana Pires/I-2670-2012; Diniz-Filho, Jose Alexandre/D-9405-2013	Diniz-Filho, Jose Alexandre/0000-0002-0967-9684													1415-4757	1678-4685					2006	29	2					207	214		10.1590/S1415-47572006000200004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1415-47572006000200004													WOS:000238482000004
J	Olivares-Benitez, E; Ríos-Mercado, RZ; González-Velarde, JL				Olivares-Benitez, Elias; Rios-Mercado, Roger Z.; Luis Gonzalez-Velarde, Jose			A metaheuristic algorithm to solve the selection of transportation channels in supply chain design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS												This paper addresses a supply chain design problem based on a two-echelon single-product system. In the first echelon the plants transport the product to distribution centers. In the second echelon the distribution centers transport the product to the customers. Several transportation channels are available between nodes in each echelon, with different transportation costs and times. The decision variables are the opening of distribution centers from a discrete set, the selection of the transportation channels, and the flow between facilities. The problem is modeled as a bi-objective mixed-integer program. The cost objective aggregates the opening costs and the transportation costs. The time objective considers the longest transportation time from the plants to the customers. An implementation of the classic epsilon-constraint method was used to generate true efficient sets for small instances of the problem, and approximate efficient sets for larger instances. A metaheuristic algorithm was developed to solve the problem, as the major contribution of this work. The metaheuristic algorithm combines principles of greedy functions, Scatter Search, Path Relinking and Mathematical Programming. The large instances were solved with the metaheuristic algorithm and a comparison was made in time and quality with the epsilon-constraint based algorithm. The results were favorable to the metaheuristic algorithm for large instances of the problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using the exploratory data analysis (EDA), a set of statistical methods were used to improve the quality of previous CFD-based optimization dataset, as an aid in reducing outliers, data skewness and avoiding the presence of redundant information. The pre-processed dataset was analyzed by unsupervised learning method in order to gain insight on the correlation between tip geometry and single stage axial turbine performance. Utilizing the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we developed a new continuous, dimensionality-reduced parametrization which allows overcoming the limitations of discrete topology approaches. The novel statistical shape model, coupled with genetic operators into a NSGA-II optimization strategy, was used to explore the design space of optimal solutions generating new designs to enrich the available Pareto front in terms of aero-thermodynamic performance metrics. Two metamodels for performance prediction, respectively based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) have been developed in order to guide the Pareto front exploration avoiding the use of computationally intensive CFD simulations. New tip designs were carried out to spread the previous optimal front and, successively, aiming to design individuals able to reduce macroscopic not uniformity of the flow keeping optimal aerodynamic performance.

But approachs offered in most conventional simulation languages, discrete event simulation, network simulation and continuous simulation lack a natural way of simulation modeling. It is believed that object-oriented simulation may overcome the intrinsic limitations of conventional simulation languages. Object-oriented Simulation (OOS) provides a more natural way of modeling complex phenomenon and a higher productivity during the incremental phases of development but it is not a panacea. In this paper, the authors relate their experience with SmallTalk-80, an object-oriented language which gained popularity in the last few years. More specifically, the article begins with a few historical developments that lead to object-oriented programming. We will also present some characteristics of an object-oriented simulation product specialized in material handling system design that is currently under development. The product called CAD/MHS (Computed Aided Design for Material Handling Systems) is in its early phase of development but it is already very promising. CAD/MHS is being written in SmallTalk-80 on a Sun SparkStation, it features windowing capabilities, integrated graphics and code portability, three fundamental aspects that are considered essential in todays very fast changing market, We will also discuss the ergonomically designed interface and some of its components. The modeling aspect of certain material handling devices, the potential of such an environment and future developments to be included wilt also be discussed.																			0360-8352					NOV	1992	23	1-4					249	252		10.1016/0360-8352(92)90110-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0360-8352(92)90110-6													WOS:A1992KA10500061
J	Ebli, HG; Nekoui, MA				Ebli, H. Ghasemzadeh; Nekoui, Mohammad Ali			Multirate control of nonlinear robotic manipulators with network structure under bounded disturbances	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL												This paper investigates a novel nonlinear multirate controller for robotic manipulators exposed to communication constraints and external disturbances. An improved tracking control methodology using an estimated discrete-time model of the robot is presented in this paper. The input-to-state stability of the sampled-data dynamics of the robot is preserved for both single-rate and multirate samplings. The obtained outcomes demonstrate that the sampled-data structure can stabilize the robotic manipulator when the continuous-time controller is not valid in the presence of communication networks. The output sampled measures of the robot provide piecewise signals for the controller, and the input to the plant results from a time-driven zero order hold device. In this paper, the discontinuous Lyapunov-based method is proposed to reject time variant and bounded disturbances. This is a novel controller design that can lead to the exact trajectory following without having details of the nonlinear dynamics of the robot. The main target is improving the accuracy of tracking ability of the robot manipulator to follow a reference input affected by constant bounded disturbances. Simulation results performed on a two degrees of freedom manipulator indicate that under proper assumptions, accurate trajectory tracking, and disturbance rejection at the input can be obtained by using the proposed structure. The example also demonstrates that the proposed multirate controller can successfully stabilize the robotic system.																			1077-5463	1741-2986				SEP	2019	25	18					2523	2533		10.1177/1077546319858847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077546319858847													WOS:000483845700010
J	Himanshu; Chakraborty, K				Himanshu; Chakraborty, Kaushik			Developing efficient deep learning model for predicting copolymer properties	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Deep learning models are gaining popularity and potency in predicting polymer properties. These models can be built using pre-existing data and are useful for the rapid prediction of polymer properties. However, the performance of a deep learning model is intricately connected to its topology and the volume of training data. There is no facile protocol available to select a deep learning architecture, and there is a lack of a large volume of homogeneous sequence-property data of polymers. These two factors are the primary bottleneck for the efficient development of deep learning models for polymers. Here we assess the severity of these factors and propose strategies to address them. We show that a linear layer-by-layer expansion of a neural network can help in identifying the best neural network topology for a given problem. Moreover, we map the discrete sequence space of a polymer to a continuous one-dimensional latent space using a feature extraction technique to identify minimal data points for training a deep learning model. We implement these approaches for two representative cases of building sequence-property surrogate models, viz., the single-molecule radius of gyration of a copolymer and copolymer compatibilizer. This work demonstrates efficient methods for building deep learning models with minimal data and hyperparameters for predicting sequence-defined properties of polymers. We report data and topology selection methods for developing an efficient deep neural network (DNN) model that predicts sequenced-defined properties of polymers.					., Himanshu/JDW-2986-2023	., Himanshu/0000-0001-7577-9774; Patra, Tarak/0000-0002-6002-0922													1463-9076	1463-9084				SEP 27	2023	25	37					25166	25176		10.1039/d3cp03100d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d3cp03100d		SEP 2023						37712405					WOS:001065593200001
J	Wang, ZY; Zuo, RG; Yang, FF				Wang, Ziye; Zuo, Renguang; Yang, Fanfan			Geological Mapping Using Direct Sampling and a Convolutional Neural Network Based on Geochemical Survey Data	MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES												Geochemical mapping based on machine learning algorithms has been proven to significantly improve the efficiency of geological mapping related to mineral exploration. This process is generally implemented by interpolating discrete geochemical data into spatially continuous fields and comparing chemical composition and spatial distribution to a reference. However, the use of geochemical survey data for geological mapping is challenging because of discontinuous geochemical sampling and inferior model performance owing to the restriction of insufficient training samples and spatial feature representations. Geochemical data interpolation is subject to uncertainty that also deserves be quantified. This study addresses the above challenges by using a direct sampling (DS) multiple-point statistical technique in conjunction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. Specifically, the DS technique is designed to produce spatially continuous and sufficient samples by reconstructing unsampled locations from sparse geochemical survey data; and CNN facilitates automatic lithological feature learning and classification based on multilevel convolutional operations that considers the spatial information within neighboring samples. The proposed framework is illustrated in a case study mapping lithological units in Daqiao district, western China, and compared with the deterministic interpolation approach visually and quantitatively. Most lithological units were correctly identified with an overall accuracy of 94%, providing feasible and practical insight into geological mapping using stream sediment geochemical survey data.

J	Lu, JW; Pan, L; Ren, QQ				Lu, Jiawei; Pan, Lin; Ren, Qianqian			Spatial-temporal memory enhanced multi-level attention network for origin-destination demand prediction	COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS												Origin-destination demand prediction is a critical task in the field of intelligent transportation systems. However, accurately modeling the complex spatial-temporal dependencies presents significant challenges, which arises from various factors, including spatial, temporal, and external influences such as geographical features, weather conditions, and traffic incidents. Moreover, capturing multi-scale dependencies of local and global spatial dependencies, as well as short and long-term temporal dependencies, further complicates the task. To address these challenges, a novel framework called the Spatial-Temporal Memory Enhanced Multi-Level Attention Network (ST-MEN) is proposed. The framework consists of several key components. Firstly, an external attention mechanism is incorporated to efficiently process external factors into the prediction process. Secondly, a dynamic spatial feature extraction module is designed that effectively captures the spatial dependencies among nodes. By incorporating two skip-connections, this module preserves the original node information while aggregating information from other nodes. Finally, a temporal feature extraction module is proposed that captures both continuous and discrete temporal dependencies using a hierarchical memory network. In addition, multi-scale features cascade fusion is incorporated to enhance the performance of the proposed model. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, extensively experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the ST-MEN model achieves excellent prediction accuracy, where the maximum improvement can reach to 19.1%.																			2199-4536	2198-6053				2024 JUN 14	2024										10.1007/s40747-024-01494-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40747-024-01494-0		JUN 2024											WOS:001247219600001

The proposed method has two major advantages over existing methods. First, based on the coupling model of coil and MSC with finite permeability and finite thickness, the image method and target-field method (TFM) are introduced to provide a flexible design method for the coil inside the MSC. Second, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are used to predict and optimize the coil parameters, thus reducing the magnetic field deviation caused by the use of discrete wires to approximate the continuous current density. Simulations indicate that this method reduces the magnetic field deviation within the target region from 2.63 x 10(-3) to 1.13 x 10(-4) compared with the coils designed using the TFM without consideration of the coupling effect. The magnetic field deviation is reduced from 1.42 x 10(-4) to 1.13 x 10(-4) compared with the coils designed in the ideal magnetic conductor. Moreover, the field deviation is reduced to 2.43 x 10(-5) after optimization using the BPNN and PSO methods. The experimental results also verify the effectiveness of the design method and its practicability in compensating for the residual field of the MSC. The method proposed in this research has major significance for the establishment of practical magnetoencephalography and magnetocardiography measurement systems.					王, 凯/HTQ-5186-2023	王, 凯/0000-0001-8364-8483; Zhang, Xu/0000-0001-8627-4253; Zhou, Weiyong/0000-0002-2132-6275; Wang, Weiqian/0000-0002-9135-2815; Zhao, Fengwen/0000-0002-6909-6632													0018-9456	1557-9662					2022	71								4006309	10.1109/TIM.2022.3188525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2022.3188525													WOS:000828692100008
J	Chen, XL; Yuan, P				Chen, Xiaoli; Yuan, Ping			Event-triggered generalized dissipative filtering for delayed neural networks under aperiodic DoS jamming attacks	NEUROCOMPUTING												This paper is concerned with event-triggered generalized dissipative filtering for delayed neural networks under aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Note that DoS attacks impede the wireless communications on measurement from time to time. This paper aims at designing resilient filters against DoS attacks to estimate neuronal states in the sense of dissipative. For this goal, a switched filter is introduced to cope with DoS attacks and unavailability of state information. In order to save precious communication resources, an event-triggered communication scheme is devised to transmit only necessary information to the filter. With such setting, the filtering error system is modeled as a switched system with time-delay. By employing the piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and linear matrix inequality techniques, some criteria on the existence of suitable filters are presented against aperiodic DoS attacks while suitable filtering performance can be ensured. It should be mentioned that since a generalized dissipative performance index is introduced, several kinds of resilient event-based filtering issues, such as H-infinity filtering, passive filtering, mixed H(infinity )and passive filtering, (Q, S, R)-dissipative filtering are solved in a unified framework in the presence of aperiodic DoS attacks. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the service coverage is limited by the static servers. Therefore, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility are deployed as aerial base stations (BS) to assist ground users to offload the task and process the data on edge. In this article, we introduce a decentralized user allocation and dynamic service scheme to assign the UAV deployment for a multi-UAV MEC system, which incorporates the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology into a two-layer training framework. The continuous action, including the UAV trajectory and bit allocation of offloading, is first optimized in the lower layer, while the upper one concentrates on the discrete action space for the user allocation. In particular, we develop a constraint reward function that considers the communication quality in the lower layer to accomplish efficient communication. The well-trained neural network is embedded in the upper layer to provide rapid feedback for the upper environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance than the baseline methods in terms of the user energy consumption.

Robust Scheduling and Resource Allocation in the Downlink of Spatially Correlated MIMO-OFDMA Wireless Systems With Imperfect CSIT	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY												Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) has been selected as the core physical-layer access scheme for the downlink of state-of-the-art and next-generation wireless communications standards. In these systems, scheduling and resource allocation (SRA) algorithms, jointly assigning transmission data rates, bandwidth, and power, become crucial in optimizing resource utilization while providing support to multimedia applications with heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To this end, the transmitter is assumed to have channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) that will typically be imperfect. This paper introduces a unified analytical framework for robust channel-and queue-aware QoS-guaranteed cross-layer SRA algorithms for the downlink of MIMO-OFDMA networks with imperfect CSIT. The framework is based on the statistical characterization of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under imperfect CSIT and is general enough to encompass spatial correlation effects in the Tx and Rx antenna arrays, different types of traffic, uniform and continuous power allocation, discrete and continuous rate allocation, and protocols with different amounts of channel and queue awareness. Simulation results using parameters drawn from the Third-Generation Partnership Project Long-Term Evolution (3GPP-LTE) standard demonstrate the validity and advantages of the proposed robust cross-layer unified approach.

J	Cai, JY; Feng, JW; Wang, JY; Zhao, Y				Cai, Jiayi; Feng, Jianwen; Wang, Jingyi; Zhao, Yi			Tracking Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems Under Switching Topologies via Novel SMC: An Event-Triggered Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												This paper investigates the tracking consensus issue for second order multi-agent systems (MAS) under switching topologies by using a novel event-triggered sliding mode control strategy. First, in order to compensate for the effect brought by the information transmission caused by event-triggered sampling and the switching topologies respectively, the dynamic sliding mode control (SMC) mechanism is proposed based on two discrete level sets. By considering the event-triggered rules and the sliding mode method jointly, the corresponding limited-information-based protocol is constructed. This technology does not require the system dynamics to reach the sliding mode manifold compared to previous studies. In addition, with the help of the boundary layer technique, the control protocol is designed to be continuous, which can reduce the chattering of the system and increase the life of machine. Through strict mathematical derivation, when the dwell time of switching between different communication graph candidates is within a limited range, it is proved that the consensus error of the nonlinear multi-agent systems (NMAS) with disturbances converges to an adjustable bounded set, and the networked harmonic oscillator systems (NHOS) without disturbances asymptotically reaches zero. Finally, Zeno behavior can be avoided entirely, and several numerical examples are presented to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

J	Zhang, Y; Zhang, R; Li, HF				Zhang, Yuan; Zhang, Ran; Li, Huifeng			Online Path Decision of No-Fly Zones Avoidance for Hypersonic Vehicles Based on a Graph Attention Network	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS												The path decision problem for a hypersonic vehicle has been recently formulated as it helps to determine a good initial guess for trajectory optimization with no-fly zone constraints. This path decision problem is a hybrid problem. Discrete variables optimize paths and continuous variables optimize dynamics, which consumes costly computation time and is hard to apply in online scenarios. To reduce the computation, instead of directly solving the hybrid problem, we design a heuristics approach taking advantage of the interpretability and flexibility of a graph attention network (GAT). The path decision is modeled by a directed graph and transformed into a GAT training problem, and the resulting GAT can directly output a path in online use. During this work, there are two innovations: 1) GAT customization and 2) offline training. First, we define the mask to express the graph structure, and model the problem-specific decoder process in the GAT, thus meeting the path decision logic of no-fly zones avoidance and ensuring the solutions are feasible. Second, we numerically integrate dynamics by a path-following guidance law, calculate the total control effort as the cost function, and use this cost to train the GAT based on the widely used REINFORCE, thus conforming to dynamics that are practical for hypersonic vehicles. Simulation results illustrate the high-accuracy path decision, much faster calculation, and generalization on no-fly zone layouts and numbers.																			0018-9251	1557-9603				OCT	2023	59	5					5554	5567		10.1109/TAES.2023.3260071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2023.3260071													WOS:001101791300056

Considering the non-synchronization phenomenon between the Markovian jump systems and the sliding controller, an asynchronous control method with a stochastic variable is adopted to describe the connections of the systems and controller. On the other hand, not full of states are accessible for the controller since it is impossible or very expensive to estimate all of states, while the output information can be acquired to the controller all the time. Based on the above aspects, the asynchronous output feedback controller via sliding mode for fuzzy Markovian jump systems is investigated to ensure the sliding mode dynamics to be stochastically stable, besides, several sufficient conditions are given to find a set of feasible solutions of the controller parameters. The asynchronous sliding mode control law is synthesized to guarantee the reachability of the trajectories of the closed-loop systems. Finally, a simulation example is to verify the effectiveness of the control strategy. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Franklin Institute.

J	Wan, ZX; Dai, YC; Mao, YX				Wan, Zhexiong; Dai, Yuchao; Mao, Yuxin			Learning Dense and Continuous Optical Flow From an Event Camera	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING												Event cameras such as DAVIS can simultaneously output high temporal resolution events and low frame-rate intensity images, which own great potential in capturing scene motion, such as optical flow estimation. Most of the existing optical flow estimation methods are based on two consecutive image frames and can only estimate discrete flow at a fixed time interval. Previous work has shown that continuous flow estimation can be achieved by changing the quantities or time intervals of events. However, they are difficult to estimate reliable dense flow, especially in the regions without any triggered events. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based dense and continuous optical flow estimation framework from a single image with event streams, which facilitates the accurate perception of high-speed motion. Specifically, we first propose an event-image fusion and correlation module to effectively exploit the internal motion from two different modalities of data. Then we propose an iterative update network structure with bidirectional training for optical flow prediction. Therefore, our model can estimate reliable dense flow as two-frame-based methods, as well as estimate temporal continuous flow as event-based methods. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real captured datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing event-based state-of-the-art methods and our designed baselines for accurate dense and continuous optical flow estimation.

In order to save the utilization bandwidth and energy, we present the event-triggered mechanism to decrease the number of a data packet for computation and transmission. Based upon the traditional model, the upper and lower bounds of communication delay are dealt with Seuret and Gouaisbaut integral and it is proposed the first time to handle with integral inequalities. This scheme is verified to be less conservative than the existing integral inequality approach. Moreover, the associated Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is considered to grantee the closed loop for stochastic stability analysis of Markovian descriptor jump system. Finally, a PV-small hydro hybrid microgrid example is given to elaborate the potentiality and effectiveness of the proposed design technique.

Due to the inconsistent task objective with that of PLM, we argue that their modeling paradigm has not well exploited the abundant semantic information and linguistic knowledge embedded in the pre-training process. Recently, the pre-train, prompt, and predict paradigm, called prompt learning, has achieved many successes in natural language processing domain. In this paper, we make the first trial of this new paradigm to develop a Prompt Learning for News Recommendation (Prompt4NR) framework, which transforms the task of predicting whether a user would click a candidate news as a cloze-style mask-prediction task. Specifically, we design a series of prompt templates, including discrete, continuous, and hybrid templates, and construct their corresponding answer spaces to examine the proposed Prompt4NR framework. Furthermore, we use the prompt ensembling to integrate predictions from multiple prompt templates. Extensive experiments on the MIND dataset validate the effectiveness of our Prompt4NR with a set of new benchmark results.

First, to account for the significant tension-compression asymmetry and dissipative constraint of CDC damper force, a piecewise damping-force model is developed with current serving as input. Due to the nonlinear terms, T-S fuzzy system is then utilized to describe the suspension system via the sector nonlinearity approach. Finally, a fuzzy state feedback controller considering the asymmetry saturation of the control current is designed for the obtained switched T-S fuzzy model with optimized H infinity performance for suspension system by using the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. Simulation and experimental results under sinusoidal, random and transient excitations show significant improvements of the proposed approach on ride comfort and road handling while guaranteeing the performance under the input current constraint.

A Multi-Objective Active Learning Platform and Web App for Reaction Optimization	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												We report the development of an open-source experimental design via Bayesian optimization platform for multiimentation (HTE) and virtual screening data sets containing highdimensional continuous and discrete variables, we optimized the performance of the platform by fine-tuning the algorithm components such as reaction encodings, surrogate model parameters, and initialization techniques. Having established the framework, we applied the optimizer to real-world test scenarios for the simultaneous optimization of the reaction yield and enantioselectivity in a Ni/photoredox-catalyzed enantioselective crosselectrophile coupling of styrene oxide with two different aryl iodide substrates. Starting with no previous experimental data, the Bayesian optimizer identified reaction conditions that surpassed the previously human-driven optimization campaigns within 15 and 24 experiments, for each substrate, among 1728 possible configurations available in each optimization. To make the platform more accessible to nonexperts, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be accessed online through a web-based application and incorporated features such as condition modification on the fly and data visualization. This web application does not require software installation, removing any programming barrier to use the platform, which enables chemists to integrate Bayesian optimization routines into their everyday laboratory practices.

To realize the digital communication between signals and utilize limited communication bandwidth effectively, we introduce the Sigma Delta quantizer with limited communication data rate (quantization bits) into the control field and for the design of the QILC in this paper. In addition, the packet losses are also first considered into the QILC, which makes the controller more close to the practical engineering applications. Since the nonlinearity and randomness introduced by the quantization and packet losses, a decreasing learning gain is utilized with the help of the non-smooth analysis and mathematical expectation for the analysis of convergence. Accurate tracking in the sense of expectation can be obtained based on randomly small number of quantization bits, even merely one bit of quantization information. Numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

The dual mode circuit for the FPAA is capable of achieving targeted optimal performance in different applications. The architecture utilizes routing switches in a CB not only for the signal interconnection purpose but also for control of the electrical charge transfer required in switched-capacitor circuits. This way, the performance of the circuit in either mode shall not be hampered with adding of programmability. The proposed FPAA is designed and implemented in a 0.18 mu m standard CMOS process with a 3.3 V supply voltage. The result from post-layout simulation shows that a maximum bandwidth of 265 MHz through the interconnection network is achieved. The measured results from demonstrated examples show that the maximum signal bandwidth of up to 2 MHz in CT mode is obtained with the spurious free dynamic range of 54 dB, while the signal processing precision in DT mode reaches 96.4%.

The receiver of large-scale solar chemical plants consists of several of these reactors to quasi-continuously use the solar resource. For this, the heliostat field needs to provide a non-uniform time-varying flux density distribution. As this differs from the heliostat field control of a typical CSP plant, it challenges its control. Here, we propose a cascade controller for a coupled system of heliostat field and receiver consisting of 19 thermochemical batch reactors for hydrogen generation. In the receiver controller, a fast long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model predicts the future temperatures and the ceria reduction extends in the reactors as a function of the flux density. It is trained with data from a thermochemical reactor model. The trained LSTM neural network is embedded in a hybrid automaton to model the continuous batch process states. Discrete state changes are made when certain conditions are reached. In this way, the receiver controller determines flux density setpoints leading to high efficiencies for each reactor. The heliostat field controller applies aim point optimization to provide flux densities close to these setpoints. With this cascade control, reactor array efficiencies of 79% are obtained simulatively. Moreover, the individual reactors operate within their material limits and come close to their optimal efficiency. In addition, it is found that secondary concentrators complicate the control and decrease the reactor array efficiency. However, they still increase the overall efficiency by 51.3% due to a significantly higher optical efficiency.

Developing a Continuous Severity Scale for Macular Telangiectasia Type 2 Using Deep Learning and Implications for Disease Grading	OPHTHALMOLOGY												Purpose: Deep learning (DL) models have achieved state-of-the-art medical diagnosis classification accuracy. Current models are limited by discrete diagnosis labels, but could yield more information with diagnosis in a continuous scale. We developed a novel continuous severity scaling system for macular telangiectasia (MacTel) type 2 by combining a DL classification model with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Design: We used a DL network to learn a feature representation of MacTel severity from discrete severity labels and applied UMAP to embed this feature representation into 2 dimensions, thereby creating a continuous MacTel severity scale. Participants: A total of 2003 OCT volumes were analyzed from 1089 MacTel Project participants. Methods: We trained a multiview DL classifier using multiple B-scans from OCT volumes to learn a previously published discrete 7-step MacTel severity scale. The classifiers' last feature layer was extracted as input for UMAP, which embedded these features into a continuous 2 -dimensional manifold. The DL classifier was assessed in terms of test accuracy. Rank correlation for the continuous UMAP scale against the previously published scale was calculated. Additionally, the UMAP scale was assessed in the K agreement against 5 clinical experts on 100 pairs of patient volumes. For each pair of patient volumes, clinical experts were asked to select the volume with more severe MacTel disease and to compare them against the UMAP scale. Main Outcome Measures: Classification accuracy for the DL classifier and K agreement versus clinical experts for UMAP. Results: The multiview DL classifier achieved top 1 accuracy of 63.3% (186/294) on held-out test OCT volumes. The UMAP metric showed a clear continuous gradation of MacTel severity with a Spearman rank correlation of 0.84 with the previously published scale. Furthermore, the continuous UMAP metric achieved K agreements of 0.56 to 0.63 with 5 clinical experts, which was comparable with interobserver K values. Conclusions: Our UMAP embedding generated a continuous MacTel severity scale, without requiring continuous training labels. This technique can be applied to other diseases and may lead to more accurate diagnosis, improved understanding of disease progression, and key imaging features for pathologic characteristics.

IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference				IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	MAR 13-17, 2005	New Orleans, LA	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc				In the ground radio environment, the propagation loss and multipath fading can make the received power of packets at an intended destination differ by an order of magnitude. Such a condition allows the designer to take advantage of the capture effect under which the packet with the strongest power may be successfully received even in the presence of other interfering packets. The latter phenomena is reinforced under Randomized Power Control Algorithms: every node, based on the power density function f(P), independently selects a power level (from a discrete or continuous set of available power levels) for transmission of each one of its packets. In this paper, we develop and investigate a novel power control algorithm (the Fair Randomized Power Control algorithm; FRPC) to enhance the throughput level of the slotted Aloha medium access control mechanism. FRPC is developed based on the analysis of the capture effect for which the transmitter captures the channel only if the observed signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) at receiver is above a certain threshold. We first analyze the sensitivity of the generic randomized power control algorithm with respect to expected value and standard deviation of the power density function. In particular, based on the one-tailed version of Chebyshev's inequality, we derive a closed-form expression for an upper bound on the probability of capture (and an upper bound on the aggregate throughput) in the network. We then apply the latter result to the process of designing the FRPC algorithm for the slotted Aloha MAC mechanism. Our simulation results indicate that the FRPC algorithm leads to significant throughput gain while providing fairness for different mobile users in the system.																			1525-3511		0-7803-8966-2				2005							707	711																WOS:000230926801009

The kinetic pathway of membrane states associated with rapidly occurring nonequilibrium self-assembled lipid/protein nanoarchitectures was determined by millisecond time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at high resolution. The neurotrophin binding and millisecond trafficking along the flexible membranes induced an unusual overlay of channel-network architectures including two coexisting cubic lattices epitaxially connected to lamellar membrane stacks. These time-resolved membrane processes, involving intercalation of discrete stiff proteins in continuous soft membranes, evidence stepwise curvature control mechanisms.

Pathways to efficient neuromorphic computing with non-volatile memory technologies	APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS												Historically, memory technologies have been evaluated based on their storage density, cost, and latencies. Beyond these metrics, the need to enable smarter and intelligent computing platforms at a low area and energy cost has brought forth interesting avenues for exploiting non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies. In this paper, we focus on non-volatile memory technologies and their applications to bio-inspired neuromorphic computing, enabling spike-based machine intelligence. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) based on discrete neuronal "action potentials" are not only bio-fidel but also an attractive candidate to achieve energy-efficiency, as compared to state-of-the-art continuous-valued neural networks. NVMs offer promise for implementing both area- and energy-efficient SNN compute fabrics at almost all levels of hierarchy including devices, circuits, architecture, and algorithms. The intrinsic device physics of NVMs can be leveraged to emulate dynamics of individual neurons and synapses. These devices can be connected in a dense crossbar-like circuit, enabling in-memory, highly parallel dot-product computations required for neural networks. Architecturally, such crossbars can be connected in a distributed manner, bringing in additional system-level parallelism, a radical departure from the conventional von-Neumann architecture. Finally, cross-layer optimization across underlying NVM based hardware and learning algorithms can be exploited for resilience in learning and mitigating hardware inaccuracies. The manuscript starts by introducing both neuromorphic computing requirements and non-volatile memory technologies. Subsequently, we not only provide a review of key works but also carefully scrutinize the challenges and opportunities with respect to various NVM technologies at different levels of abstraction from devices-to-circuit-to-architecture and co-design of hardware and algorithm.

The baseline MSSMP sensor suite consists of a pan/tilt unit with video and FLIR cameras and laser rangefinder. With an additional radio transceiver, MSSMP can also function as a gateway between existing security/surveillance sensor systems such as TASS, TRSS, and IREMBASS, and IP-based networks, to support the timely distribution of both threat detection and threat assessment information. The MSSMP system makes maximum use of Commercial Off The Shelf(COTS) components for sensing, processing, and communications, and of both established and emerging standard communications networking protocols and system integration techniques. Its use of IF-based protocols allows it to freely interoperate with the Internet -- providing geographic transparency, facilitating development, and allowing fully distributed demonstration capability -- and prepares it for integration with the IF-based tactical radio networks that will evolve in the next decade. Unfortunately, the Internet's standard Transport layer protocol, TCP, is poorly matched to the requirements of security sensors and other quasi-autonomous systems in being oriented to conveying a continuous data stream, rather than discrete messages. Also, its canonical "socket" interface both conceals short losses of communications connectivity and simply gives up and forces the Application layer software to deal with longer losses. For MSSMP, a software applique is being developed that will run on top of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to provide a reliable message-based Transport service. In addition, a Session layer protocol is being developed to support the effective transfer of control of multiple platforms among multiple control stations.

Reducing passengers' travel time by optimising stopping patterns in a large-scale network: A case-study in the Copenhagen Region	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE												Optimising stopping patterns in railway schedules is a cost-effective way to reduce passengers' generalised travel costs without increasing train operators' costs. The challenge consists in striking a balance between an increase in waiting time for passengers at skipped stations and a decrease in travel time for through-going passengers, with possible consequent changes in the passenger demand and route choices. This study presents the formulation of the skip-stop problem as a bi-level optimisation problem where the lower level is a schedule-based transit assignment model that delivers passengers' route choices to the skip-stop optimisation model at the upper level, and where the upper level in return provides an improved timetable to the lower level. A heuristic method for large-scale urban networks is presented to solve this extremely complex bi-level problem, where the skip-stop optimisation is a mixed-integer problem, whereas the route choice model is a non-linear non-continuous mapping of the timetable. The method was tested on the suburban railway network in the Greater Copenhagen Region (Denmark): the reduction in railway passengers' in-vehicle travel time was 5.5%, the reduction in passengers' generalised travel cost was 3.2% and, at the system level, the yearly consumer surplus amounted at 76.7 million DKK (about 10.3 million EUR or 12.7 million USD) when compared to the existing stopping patterns.

However, there are no reports on the discrete memristor based neural network. In this work, a novel discrete memristor BP neural network is designed. Firstly, a discrete memristor is introduced, in which the internal state can be controlled by the input discrete current signal. Secondly, theoretical basis of the proposed discrete memristor BP neural network is given where the weights are defined by the memristor resistance and can be adjusted according to discrete feedback errors. Finally, a three layers discrete memristor BP neural network is built to perform MNIST-10 handwriting recognition. Numerical results show a high classification accuracy of 97.16% and it verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.																			0925-2312	1872-8286				FEB 28	2023	523						1	8		10.1016/j.neucom.2022.12.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2022.12.014		DEC 2022											WOS:000904782300001
J	Feng, XE; Li, YQ; Xu, MQ				Feng, Xiaoen; Li, Yuqing; Xu, Minqiang			Multi-satellite cooperative scheduling method for large-scale tasks based on hybrid graph neural network and metaheuristic algorithm	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS												Traditional heuristic optimization algorithms are no longer applicable to the multiple satellites scheduling with large-scale tasks, as they are unable to provide satisfactory performance in terms of convergence and speed when addressing complex constraint conflicts. Therefore, we propose a multi-satellite cooperative scheduling method for large-scale tasks based on a hybrid graph neural network (GNN) and metaheuristic algorithm. By using the representation and extraction capability of GNN for relations in graph, the features of large-scale tasks and their constraint relations were expressed, and the generalized knowledge was extracted. And combined with metaheuristic algorithm, the optimization framework for large-scale satellite task scheduling based knowledge and data was implemented. The method consists of a GNN pre-solver module for static constraint conflicts and a metaheuristic optimization module for dynamic constraint conflicts of satellite missions. In the GNN pre-solver module, the graph sample and aggregate network was used to learn and extract the common knowledge in the static task-conflict graph, and provided effective prior information for the metaheuristic optimization module. The quadratic unconstrained binary optimization loss function was designed with multiple influencing factors, to convert the discrete optimization function into a continuous function; a greedy threshold was also added to improve the task completion rate. Finally, numerical experimental results showed that the proposed method can achieve an efficient solution to the multi-satellite scheduling problem with tens of thousands tasks. Compared with the commonly used multi-satellite scheduling algorithms (the genetic algorithm (GA) and greedy-GA), the proposed method can obtain higher-quality solutions under the same conditions and greatly improve the computational efficiency of large-scale mission planning.																			1474-0346	1873-5320				APR	2024	60								102362	10.1016/j.aei.2024.102362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2024.102362		JAN 2024											WOS:001176347400001
J	Labatut, V				Labatut, Vincent			Continuous average Straightness in spatial graphs	JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS												The Straightness is a measure designed to characterize a pair of vertices in a spatial graph. It is defined as the ratio of the Euclidean distance to the graph distance between these vertices. It is often used as an average, for instance to describe the accessibility of a single vertex relatively to all the other vertices in the graph, or even to summarize the graph as a whole. In some cases, one needs to process the Straightness between not only vertices, but also any other points constituting the graph of interest. Suppose for instance that our graph represents a road network and we do not want to limit ourselves to crossroad-to-crossroad itineraries, but allow any street number to be a starting point or destination. In this situation, the standard approach consists in: (1) discretizing the graph edges, (2) processing the vertex-to-vertex Straightness considering the additional vertices resulting from this discretization and (3) performing the appropriate average on the obtained values. However, this discrete approximation can be computationally expensive on large graphs, and its precision has not been clearly assessed. In this article, we adopt a continuous approach to average the Straightness over the edges of spatial graphs. This allows us to derive five distinct measures able to characterize precisely the accessibility of the whole graph, as well as individual vertices and edges. Our method is generic and could be applied to other measures designed for spatial graphs. We perform an experimental evaluation of our continuous average Straightness measures, and show how they behave differently from the traditional vertex-to-vertex ones. Moreover, we also study their discrete approximations, and show that our approach is globally less demanding in terms of both processing time and memory usage. Our R source code is publicly available under an open source license.

The healthcare concept continuous care in a regional network (RubiN) offers a care and case management in physician networks for geriatric patients and aims to relieve family caregivers. The aim of the study was to develop and to test the psychometric properties of a questionnaire that evaluates the satisfaction and acceptance of the healthcare provided by case management (CM) from the perspective of family caregivers. Methods A mixed methods design was used to develop the questionnaire based on qualitative interviews, a literature search and own project experiences. After a pilot run the subsequent data acquisition took place in the participating RubiN physician networks from May to August 2020. Each of the 5 participating networks received a set of 50 questionnaires for family caregivers. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire were evaluated. Results The questionnaire consisted of 11 items. A total of 137 family caregivers participated in the survey (response rate 55%). Overall, the family caregivers were very satisfied (78.1%) with the care offered. There were only a few missing values in the data. The 11 items in the questionnaire loaded on 2 factors. The first factor called effects from coordination showed an internal consistency of 0.843 and for the second factor called accessibility an internal consistency of 0.683 was observed. Conclusion The questionnaire with 11 items is characterized by its brevity and includes the acceptance and satisfaction of the care elements offered for family caregivers in a geriatric CM.

However, conflicts between the desired properties result in tremendous challenges in the design and fabrication of these polymer materials. Here, we develop a novel approach to the preparation of excellent elastomeric foams that can meet the aforementioned requirements. A segregated carbon nanotube (CNT) network and porous structure are constructed synchronously in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix by employing a combinatorial procedure of suspension mixing and the template foaming method. The resulting foams exhibit a novel "sea-island" structure, in which the rubber phase with a segregated CNT network and ultrathin-shell expanded polymer microspheres are regarded as the continuous phase and the disperse phase, respectively. The obtained foam possesses an adjustable density (0.26-0.6 g/cm(3)), considerably low thermal conductivity (0.028-0.064 W/(m.K)), preeminent electrical conductivity (44.23 S/m), outstanding compressive strength (14.67 MPa), and good impact strength (2.80 kJ/m(2)). Furthermore, the EMI shielding effectiveness is excellent, reaching 44.51 dB, and 88.76% of the shielding effectiveness can be maintained after the self-healing procedure. These results confirm that the obtained foam has great potential for modern electronics and aerospace applications.

Firstly, this paper establishes a hybrid electric vehicle power system model. Secondly, a hierarchical energy optimization control architecture based on networked information is designed, and a traffic signal timing model is used for vehicle target speed range planning in the upper system. More specifically, the optimal vehicle speed is optimized by a model predictive control algorithm. Thirdly, a mathematical model of vehicle speed variation in connected and unconnected states is established to analyze the effect of vehicle speed planning on fuel economy. Finally, three learning-based energy optimization control strategies, namely Q-learning, deep Q network (DQN), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, are designed under the hierarchical energy optimization control architecture. It is shown that the Q-learning algorithm is able to optimize energy control; however, the agent will meet the "dimension disaster" once it faces a high-dimensional state space issue. Then, a DQN control strategy is introduced to address the problem. Due to the limitation of the discrete output of DQN, the DDPG algorithm is put forward to achieve continuous action control. In the simulation, the superiority of the DDPG algorithm over Q-learning and DQN algorithms in hybrid electric vehicles is illustrated in terms of its robustness and faster convergence for better energy management purposes.

J	Diabat, A; Theodorou, E				Diabat, Ali; Theodorou, Effrosyni			A location-inventory supply chain problem: Reformulation and piecewise linearization	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING												In this paper, we study a two-echelon inventory management problem with multiple warehouses and retailers. The problem is a natural extension to the well-known one-warehouse multi-retailer inventory problem. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear program such that its continuous relaxation is non-convex. We propose an equivalent formulation with fewer non-linear terms in the objective function so that the continuous relaxation of the new model is a convex optimization problem. We use piecewise linearization to transform the resulting MINLP to a mixed integer program and we solve it using CPLEX. Through numerical experiments, we compare the solutions obtained by solving the new formulation using CPLEX with two previously published Lagrangian relaxation based heuristics to solve the original mixed integer non-linear program. We demonstrate that the new approach is capable of providing almost the same solutions without the need of using specialized algorithms. This important contribution further implies that additional variants of the problem, such as multiple products, capacitated warehouses and routing, can be added to result in a problem that will again be solvable by commercial optimization software, while the respective Lagrangian heuristics will fail to solve such variants or extended problems.

J	Ahmad, I				Ahmad, I			HARD: A hypercube embedding algorithm for state assignment of finite state machines	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING												To minimize the area of the combinational circuit, required to realize a finite state machine (FSM), an efficient assignment of states of the FSM to a set of binary codes is required. As to find an optimal state assignment is NP-hard, therefore heuristic approaches have been taken. One approach generates an adjacency graph from the FSM model and then tries to embed the adjacency graph onto a hypercube with an objective to minimize the cost of mapping. However, hypercube embedding itself is an NP-complete problem. In this paper we present a solution to the hypercube embedding problem by designing a new technique, designated as HARD, that is a hybrid combination of non-linear programming method and a local search. We have transformed our problem from discrete space to continuous space and have applied logarithmic barrier function method, that in turn uses gradient projection approach to minimize the objective function. Each iteration of the gradient projection method produces a valid solution. Local search is performed around solution to improve its quality by using a Kernighan-Lin style algorithm. Two distributed algorithms for the HARD, have also been designed and implemented on network of workstations under message passing interface, to speed up the search. We have carried out a large number of experiments to deter-mine the efficiency of the HARD in terms of solution quality over many other techniques, and have obtained very promising results.

Due to the impact of the choice of hyperparameters on an ML classifier performance, hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step for application success. However, the practical adoption of existing hyperparameter tuning frameworks in production is hindered due to several factors such as inflexible architecture, limitations of search algorithms, software dependencies, or closed source nature. To enable state-of-the-art hyperparameter tuning in production, we propose the design of a lightweight library (1) having a flexible architecture facilitating usage on arbitrary systems, and (2) providing parallel optimization algorithms supporting mixed parameters (continuous, integer, and categorical), handling runtime failures, and allowing combined classifier selection and hyperparameter tuning (CASH). We present Mango, a black-box optimization library, to realize the proposed design. Mango is currently used in production at Arm for more than 25 months and is available open-source (https://github.com/ARM-software/mango). Our evaluation shows that Mango outperforms other black-box optimization libraries in tuning hyperparameters of ML classifiers having mixed parameter search spaces. We discuss two use cases of Mango deployed in production at Arm, highlighting its flexible architecture and ease of adoption. The first use case trains ML classifiers on the Dask cluster using Mango to find bugs in Arm's integrated circuits designs. As a second use case, we introduce an AutoML framework deployed on the Kubernetes cluster using Mango. Finally, we present the third use-case of Mango in enabling neural architecture search (NAS) to transfer deep neural networks to TinyML platforms (microcontroller class devices) used by CPS/IoT applications.																					978-1-6654-1621-4				2021							262	271		10.1109/CogMI52975.2021.00041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CogMI52975.2021.00041													WOS:000835349000032

Since strategic formulation involves multiple conflicting objectives and stakeholders, this paper presents a practicable hierarchical location-allocation model from the perspective of supply and demand to characterize the trade-off between social, economical and environmental factors. Due to the difficulties of rationally describing and the efficient calculation of location-allocation problems as a typical Non-deterministic Polynomial-Hard (NP-hard) problem with uncertainty, there are three crucial challenges for this study: (1) combining continuous location model with discrete potential positions; (2) introducing reasonable multiple conflicting objectives; (3) adapting and modifying appropriate meta-heuristic algorithms. First, we set up a hierarchical programming model, which incorporates four objective functions based on the actual backgrounds. Second, a bi-level multi-objective particle swarm optimization (BLMOPSO) algorithm is designed to deal with the binary location decision and capacity adjustment simultaneously. Finally, a realistic case study contains sixteen patient points with maximum of six open treatment units is tested to validate the availability and applicability of the whole approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is suitable to be applied as an extensive planning tool for decision makers (DMs) to generate policies and strategies in healthcare and design other facility projects.						shi, huan/0000-0001-6826-1168; Wang, Li/0000-0002-6488-5421; gan, lu/0000-0002-1811-1011														2071-1050				DEC	2018	10	12							4580	10.3390/su10124580	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124580													WOS:000455338100246
J	Yang, S; Ündar, A; Zahn, JD				Yang, Sung; Undar, Akif; Zahn, Jeffrey D.			Continuous cytometric bead processing within a microfluidic device for bead based sensing platforms	LAB ON A CHIP												A microfluidic device for continuous biosensing based on analyte binding with cytometric beads is introduced. The operating principle of the continuous biosensing is based on a novel concept named the "particle cross over'' mechanism in microfluidic channels. By carefully designing the microfluidic network the beads are able to "cross-over'' from a carrier fluid stream into a recipient fluid stream without mixing of the two streams and analyte dilution. After crossing over into the recipient stream, bead processing such as analyte-bead binding may occur. The microfluidic device is composed of a bead solution inlet, an analyte solution inlet, two washing solution inlets, and a fluorescence detection window. To achieve continuous particle cross over in microfluidic channels, each microfluidic channel is precisely designed to allow the particle cross over to occur by conducting a series of studies including an analogous electrical circuit study to find optimal fluidic resistances, an analytical determination of device dimensions, and a numerical simulation to verify microflow structures within the microfluidic channels. The functionality of the device was experimentally demonstrated using a commercially available fluorescent biotinylated fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye and streptavidin coated 8 mm-diameter beads. After, demonstrating particle cross over and biotin-streptavidin binding, the fluorescence intensity of the 8 mm-diameter beads was measured at the detection window and linearly depends on the concentration of the analyte (biotinylated FITC) at the inlet. The detection limit of the device was a concentration of 50 ng ml(-1) of biotinylated FITC.

S.; Chen, Jingxuan; You, Chaoqun; Cao, Xianbin			Feeling of Presence Maximization: mmWave-Enabled Virtual Reality Meets Deep Reinforcement Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												This paper investigates the problem of providing ultra-reliable and power-efficient virtual reality (VR) experiences for wireless mobile users. To ensure reliable ultra-high-definition (UHD) video frame delivery to mobile users and enhance their immersive visual experiences, a coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission technique and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are exploited. Owing to user movement and time-varying wireless channels, the wireless VR experience enhancement problem is formulated as a sequence-dependent and mixed-integer problem with a goal of maximizing users' feeling of presence (FoP) in the virtual world, subject to power consumption constraints on access points (APs) and users' head-mounted displays (HMDs). The problem, however, is hard to be directly solved due to the lack of users' accurate tracking information and the sequence-dependent and mixed-integer characteristics. To overcome this challenge, we develop a parallel echo state network (ESN) learning method to predict users' tracking information by training fresh and historical tracking samples separately collected by APs. With the learnt results, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. In this algorithm, we implement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a scalable solution to produce integer decision variables and solve a continuous power control problem to criticize the integer decision variables. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with various benchmark algorithms, and the impact of different design parameters is also discussed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more 4.14% power-efficient than the benchmark algorithms.					Yang, Peng/JAC-3513-2023; Quek, Tony Q.

Aimed at discovering the underlying mechanisms of the brain, a number of spiking neural networks have been proposed to mimic biological neural dynamics. Subsequently, to perceive how the neural networks in the brain work, simulation and hardware realization of large-scale systems, similar to the brain, is an essential requirement. Behavior of a single neuron can be described by the mathematical equations in different levels of computing and biological accuracy. In this approach, a new modified ADEX model is presented based on sampling frequency by the nonlinear functions of the original model. This new model is capable for reproducing all aspects of the original model in low-error and high-degree of similarity conditions. Finally, the proposed model can be implemented on digital hardware platforms to have a real digital system. Digital results show the increase in system speed (frequency) and overall saving in hardware resources (compared by the original model and other similar works). This low-cost digital hardware is applied in large-scale neuronal networks. Design and implementation of biological neural networks is a vital research field in the neuromorphic engineering. This paper presents LUT-based modeling of the Adaptive Exponential integrate-and-fire (ADEX) model using Nyquist frequency method. In this approach, a continuous term is converted to a discrete term by sampling factor. This new modeling is called N-LUT-ADEX (Nyquist-Look Up Table-ADEX) and is based on accurate sampling of the original ADEX model. Since in this modeling, the high-accuracy matching is achieved, it can exactly reproduce the spiking patterns, which have the same behaviors of the original neuron model. To confirm the N-LUT-ADEX neuron, the proposed model is realized on Virtex-II Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board for validating the final hardware. Hardware implementation results show the high degree of similarity between the proposed and original models. Furthermore, low-cost and high-speed attributes of our proposed neuron model will be validated. Indeed, the proposed model is capable of reproducing the spiking patterns in terms of low overhead costs and higher frequencies in comparison with the original one. The properties of the proposed model cause can make it a suitable choice for neuromorphic network implementations with reduced-cost attributes.

J	Wu, Y; Dong, JX				Wu, Yue; Dong, Jiuxiang			Simultaneous local stabilisation and fault detection for continuous-time T-S fuzzy systems	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												In this study, a simultaneous local stabilisation and fault detection (FD) problem for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems is investigated. The authors' attention is focused on synthesising an FD observer and an observer-based controller to achieve the objectives of local stabilisation and FD simultaneously. First, by establishing the relationship among the reachable set, the ellipsoid set and the objective area, a new local stabilisation criterion is proposed. The presented criterion guarantees that the state trajectory starting from a given local region can remain in this region even when the system is subject to disturbances and faults. Meanwhile, the FD observer is designed under a mixed $L_\infty /H\_$L infinity/H_ framework such that the residual signal is robust to the persistent disturbance and sensitive to the fault. Different from some existing methods, via the proposed scheme, the state can be restricted into the modelling area so that the non-linear control problem can be addressed by the T-S fuzzy model approach effectively. Additionally, two different methods are utilised in the co-design of the observer and the controller such that the disturbance is not required to be energy-bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by an example.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				MAY 21	2019	13	8					1071	1083		10.1049/iet-cta.2018.6124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2018.6124													WOS:000467576100004

The traditional models require higher accuracy of the input parameters, which is impossible in real forest fires. The paper proposed a fire-spreading model based on the dynamic data of the fire field to improve its adaptability. The model is designed using a convolutional neural network with mixed-inputs and attention mechanisms (MI-AM-CNN). It predicts the burn map after a period of time through the multiple-channel image containing terrain variables and the current burn map, and the scalars containing climate variables. The channel and spatial attention modules are integrated to handle the advanced features that contain important fire variables information and strengthen the influence of important features on the prediction. Based on the FARSITE, a large number of data sets are generated for training, validating, and testing the models in the paper. The proposed model MI-AM-CNN is compared with the state-of-the-art neural network models. Quantitative results show that MI-AM-CNN has the highest performance in predicting effectiveness and efficiency, and it can be applied recursively to get the continuous predicted results. In addition, the prediction results of MI-AM-CNN on the historical fire data demonstrate the ability of its application in the real fire case. The MI-AM-CNN can be used as a predictive method in firefighting operations, and its predicted results can provide theoretical support for the forest fire spread prediction method based on artificial intelligence.

Early detection of lung cancer is very important for the survival of an individual, and is a significant challenging problem. Generally, chest radiographs (X-ray) and computed tomography (CT) scans are used initially for the diagnosis of the malignant nodules; however, the possible existence of benign nodules leads to erroneous decisions. At early stages, the benign and the malignant nodules show very close resemblance to each other. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based model with multiple strategies is proposed for the precise diagnosis of the malignant nodules. Due to the recent achievements of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in image analysis, we have used two deep three-dimensional (3D) customized mixed link network (CMixNet) architectures for lung nodule detection and classification, respectively. Nodule detections were performed through faster R-CNN on efficiently-learned features from CMixNet and U-Net like encoder-decoder architecture. Classification of the nodules was performed through a gradient boosting machine (GBM) on the learned features from the designed 3D CMixNet structure. To reduce false positives and misdiagnosis results due to different types of errors, the final decision was performed in connection with physiological symptoms and clinical biomarkers. With the advent of the internet of things (IoT) and electro-medical technology, wireless body area networks (WBANs) provide continuous monitoring of patients, which helps in diagnosis of chronic diseases-especially metastatic cancers. The deep learning model for nodules' detection and classification, combined with clinical factors, helps in the reduction of misdiagnosis and false positive (FP) results in early-stage lung cancer diagnosis. The proposed system was evaluated on LIDC-IDRI datasets in the form of sensitivity (94%) and specificity (91%), and better results were obatined compared to the existing methods.

J	Abramov, E; Peretz, MM				Abramov, Eli; Peretz, Mor Mordechai			Multi-Loop Control for Power Transfer Regulation in Capacitive Wireless Systems by Means of Variable Matching Networks	IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS												This article introduces an adaptive multi-loop controller for capacitive wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. The new control approach combines continuous frequency tracking and matching networks tuning on both the primary and secondary to regulate a target current/power to the receiving side at the optimal power transfer conditions. This enables to effectively disengage the power delivery capabilities from the cross-coupling interactions between the transmitting and receiving sides and to compensate for variations of the electrical circuits and capacitive medium. This article highlights the complex functional relationships of the multi-mixed-signal controller and provides theoretical as well as practical insights on the dynamics and implementation of a closed-loop capacitive power transfer (CPT) system. The core of the multi-loop controller has been implemented through a digital orientation on an HDL platform. The effectiveness of the new controller is demonstrated on an experimental prototype of a resonant double-sided LC capacitive WPT that has been designed and implemented to operate in the megahertz (MHz) range. The experimental closed-loop operation is well demonstrated under various loads and medium conditions up to 200-mm air gap, validating the self-tuned CPT system. Furthermore, the capacitive interface has been methodically examined through Maxwell's finite-element analysis (FEA) tools for different structures, distances, and alignments. The results of the FEA have been utilized to enhance the accuracy of the experiments, accounting for the variable coupling capacitance under variations.																			2168-6777	2168-6785				SEPT	2020	8	3					2095	2110		10.1109/JESTPE.2019.2935631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2019.2935631													WOS:000554968300011

The development of lightweight, biodegradable electromagnetic interference shielding materials with dominant absorption mechanisms is of paramount importance in reducing electromagnetic pollution and the environmental impact. This study presents a successful fabrication strategy for a poly(lactic acid)/polycaprolactone/multi-walled carbon nanotube (PCL/PLA/MWCNT) composite foam, featuring a uniform porous structure. In this approach, melt mixing is combined with particle leaching techniques to create a co-continuous phase morphology when PCL and PLA are present in equal mass ratios. The MWCNT is selectively dispersed within the PCL matrix, which facilitates the formation of a robust conductive network within this morphology. In addition, the addition of the MWCNT content reduces the size of the phase domain in the PCL/PLA/MWCNT composite, showing an adept ability to construct a compact and stable conductive network. Based on its porous architecture and continuous conductive network, the composite foam with an 80% porosity and 7 wt% MWCNT content manifests an exceptional EMI shielding performance. The SET, specific SET, and SEA/SET values achieved are 22.88 dB, 88.68 dB & BULL;cm3/g, and 85.80%, respectively. Additionally, the resulting composite foams exhibit a certain resistance to compression-induced deformations. In summary, this study introduces a practical solution that facilitates the production of absorption-dominated, lightweight, and biodegradable EMI shielding materials at scale.

J	Li, WB; Chiu, PWY; Li, Z				Li, Weibing; Chiu, Philip Wai Yan; Li, Zheng			A Novel Neural Approach to Infinity-Norm Joint-Velocity Minimization of Kinematically Redundant Robots Under Joint Limits	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												Generally, the infinity-norm joint-velocity minimization (INVM) of physically constrained kinematically redundant robots can be formulated as time-variant linear programming (TVLP) with equality and inequality constraints. Zeroing neural network (ZNN) is an effective neural method for solving equality-constrained TVLP. For inequality-constrained TVLP, however, existing ZNNs become incompetent due to the lack of relevant derivative information and the inability to handle inequality constraints. Currently, there is no capable ZNN in the literature that has achieved the INVM of redundant robots under joint limits. To fill this gap, a classical INVM scheme is first introduced in this article. Then, a new joint-limit handling technique is proposed and employed to convert the INVM scheme into a unified TVLP with full derivative information. By using a perturbed Fisher-Burmeister function, the TVLP is further converted into a nonlinear equation. These conversion techniques lay a foundation for the success of designing a capable ZNN. To solve the nonlinear equation and the TVLP, a novel continuous-time ZNN (CTZNN) is designed and its corresponding discrete-time ZNN (DTZNN) is established using an extrapolated backward differentiation formula. Theoretical analysis is rigorously conducted to prove the convergence of the neural approach. Numerical studies are performed by comparing the DTZNN solver and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) linear programming (LP) solvers. Comparative results show that the DTZNN consumes the least computing time and can be a powerful alternative to the SOTA solvers. The DTZNN and the INVM scheme are finally applied to control two kinematically redundant robots. Both simulative and experimental results show that the robots successfully accomplish user-specified path-tracking tasks, verifying the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed neural approach and the INVM scheme equipped with the new joint-limit handling technique.

The emerging multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology has been recently applied to improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff of mobile video analytics. In this paper, we study an MEC-enabled multi-device video analytics system and formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) to meet two practical challenges: i) the absence of ground truth in real-time and ii) the content-varying degradation-accuracy relation. In particular, we aim to design an online joint frame degradation and bandwidth allocation algorithm with the time-varying function and limited feedback from each device. Thanks to the MDP formulation and n-step return technique, the long-term goal offers adaptive information gathering and thus improves the average accuracy and latency. For sample efficiency, we decompose the MDP problem into discrete degradation adaptation subproblems and continuous bandwidth allocation subproblems. Based on the decomposition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework, referred to as DBAG, to solve the decomposed subproblems. DBAG integrates model-based optimization and model-free DRL to solve the MDP problem with a discrete-continuous hybrid action space. Under various network setups and public datasets, DBAG greatly improves the accuracy-latency tradeoff.

J	Hespanha, JP				Hespanha, JP			A model for stochastic hybrid systems with application to communication networks	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-THEORY METHODS & APPLICATIONS												We propose a model for stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs) where transitions between discrete modes are triggered by stochastic events much like transitions between states of a continuous-time Markov chains. However, the rate at which transitions occur is allowed to depend both on the continuous and the discrete states of the SHS. Based on results available for piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDPs), we provide a formula for the extended generator of the SHS, which can be used to compute expectations and the overall distribution of the state. As an application, we construct a stochastic model for on-off TCP flows that considers both the congestion-avoidance and slow-start modes and takes directly into account the distribution of the number of bytes transmitted. Using the tools derived for SHSs, we model the dynamics of the moments of the sending rate by an infinite system of ODEs, which can be truncated to obtain an approximate finite-dimensional model. This model shows that, for transfer-size distributions reported in the literature, the standard deviation of the sending rate is much larger than its average. Moreover, the later seems to vary little with the probability of packet drop. This has significant implications for the design of congestion control mechanisms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhou, JH; Ren, JX; Yao, CF				Zhou, Jinhua; Ren, Junxue; Yao, Changfeng			Multi-objective optimization of multi-axis ball-end milling Inconel 718 via grey relational analysis coupled with RBF neural network and PSO algorithm	MEASUREMENT												Multi-axis ball-end milling is the most commonly used operation in machining aerospace engine parts. Because of multi-output characteristic, the process improvement often requires multi-objective optimization. Recently, the grey relational analysis (GRA) has been more and more Widely used in engineering manufacture with multiple responses. But, the original GRA method only suits for the optimization problem in discrete space. This paper proposes an integrated multi-objective optimization method with GRA, radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Compared with the original GRA, it expands the optimal solution space to continuous space. This approach is subsequently applied to the multi-objective optimization of multi-axis ball-end milling Ni-based superalloy Inconel 718. The purpose is to simultaneously obtain minimum surface roughness and maximum corhpressive residuals tress by optimizing the inclination angle, cutting speed, and feed. A hybrid experiment scheme with single factor design and orthogonal array is utilized to generate the sample data set. The multi-response optimization problem is successfully converted into the single objective optimization of grey relational grade (GRG). Then, the RBF neural network is employed to establish the mapping relation between the GRG and the process parameters. And its adequacy is proved by five test experiments with a low prediction error of 6.86%. Finally, the PSO algorithm is adopted to optimize the process parameters. Verification experiments show that a higher improvement of the GRG is obtained with the proposed method (62.87%) than that of the original GRA (50.00%).

J	Liu, LL; Wang, AM; Sun, G; Li, JH				Liu, Lingling; Wang, Aimin; Sun, Geng; Li, Jiahui			Multiobjective Optimization for Improving Throughput and Energy Efficiency in UAV-Enabled IoT	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL												Unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless communication in Internet of Things (IoT) applications is becoming the focus of attention of researchers. This article investigates a UAV-assisted communication system for serving IoT, in which multiple rotary-wing UAVs are employed to communicate with multiple terrestrial IoT devices. Specifically, we formulate a UAV deployment multiobjective optimization problem (UAVDMOP) to simultaneously maximize the minimum throughput of the UAV-device pairs, maximize the total throughput of the whole system, and minimize the total energy consumptions of UAVs via a joint optimization of the locations of UAVs, transmission power of UAVs, and association relationship between the UAVs and IoT devices. UAVDMOP consists of both discrete and continuous solution spaces, which is difficult to be solved. Thus, we propose an improved discrete and continuous multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (IDCMOEA/D) with a hybrid solution initialization operation and a hybrid solution reproduction operation for increasing the performance of the algorithm so that making it more suitable for dealing with the UAVDMOP. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to enhance the throughput and energy efficiency of the system and it has superior performance compared to other methods.					liu, lingling/IUQ-7478-2023; yuan, lin/JDW-7387-2023; liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023	Sun, Geng/0000-0001-7802-4908													2327-4662					OCT 15	2022	9	20					20763	20777		10.1109/JIOT.2022.3175712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2022.3175712													WOS:000865097300095

Along with the negative impact on the precision of the various finite-difference schemes, such effects may have surprisingly fruitful practical applications, e.g. pseudo-random number generation, image encryption with improved diffusion and confusion properties, chaotic path planning, and many others. One such application is chaos-based communication systems which gained attention in recent decades due to their high covertness and broadband transmission capability. A crucial problem in the design of chaotic communication systems is the modulation of carrier signals. Due to the noise-like properties of chaotic signals, they can barely be modulated using the same methods as conventional harmonic signals. Thus, developing new modulation techniques is of great interest in the field of chaotic communications. In this study, we investigate the discrete model of the Lorenz oscillator obtained using controllable midpoint numerical integration and develop a novel modulation technique for chaos-based communication systems. We discover and analyze the multistability phenomenon in the dynamics of the investigated finite-difference Lorenz model through bifurcation, the basin of attraction, and Lyapunov spectrum analysis procedures. Using a specially designed testbench, we explicitly show that the proposed modulation method outperforms commonly used parametric modulation and is nearly equal to the state-of-the-art symmetry-based modulation in terms of covertness and noise resistivity. In addition, the proposed modulation technique is much easier to implement using computer arithmetics, especially in fixed-point hardware. The reported results may be efficiently applied to designing advanced chaos-based communications systems or improving the characteristics of existing communication system architectures.

The soft nanocomposites were designed using melt-mixed blends of varying compositions of PC (polycarbonate) and SAN (poly styrene acrylonitrile) by compartmentalized functional nanoparticles in one of the components of the blend (here PC). Maximum attenuation of the incoming electromagnetic (EM) radiation mainly through absorption was achieved. The hetero-dielectric media at microscopic length scale in the PC component provided large interfaces which facilitated multiple scattering thereby attenuating the incoming EM radiation. This strategy of positioning the functional nanoparticles in one of the components in the blends resulted in significantly enhanced shielding effectiveness (SE), at any given concentration of MWNTs, in contrast to PC based composites. This enhancement in SE was realized in the special morphology of the bicomponent PC/SAN=60/40 wt% blends where both the components are continuous. The enhanced SE in co-continuous blends is due to combined effect of enhanced electrical conductivity (more precisely due to interconnected network of the nanoparticles) and the presence of a hetero-dielectric media generating large scattering interfaces. For instance, the PC/SAN (60/40 wt%) co-continuous blend containing 3 wt% MWNTs and 10 wt% rGO@NF manifested in a total shielding effectiveness (SET) of -32.3 dB (i.e. more than 99.9% attenuation of incoming EM radiation) mainly through absorption.

Prior methods use simpler subgraphs to simulate the full model, or counterfactuals to identify the causes of a prediction. The two families of approaches aim at two distinct objectives, "simulatability" and "counterfactual relevance", but it is not clear how the objectives can jointly influence the human understanding of an explanation. We design a user-study to investigate such joint effects, and use the findings to design a multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm to find Pareto optimal explanations that are well-balanced in simulatability and counterfactual. Since the target model can be of any GNN variants and may not be accessible due to privacy concerns, we design a search algorithm using zero-th order information without accessing the architecture and parameters of the target model. Quantitative experiments on nine graphs from four applications demonstrate that the Pareto efficient explanations dominate single-objective baselines that use first-order continuous optimization or discrete combinatorial search. The explanations are further evaluated in robustness and sensitivity to show their capability of revealing convincing causes, while being cautious about the possible confounders. The diverse dominating counterfactuals can certify the feasibility of algorithmic recourse, that can potentially promote algorithmic fairness where humans are participating in the decision-making using GNN.

However, the synchronization characteristics of some sensor networks cannot be effectively guaranteed due to communication delay, nonuniform sampling, etc. Therefore, a DMT algorithm for asynchronous nonuniform multisensor networks (AN-WSN) is studied in this article. First, a CD-CPHD algorithm with the multistep birth process and time-triggered structure (TCD-CPHD) is proposed by using the continuous-discrete multitarget dynamic (CD) model and the cardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD); second, a TCD-CPHD trigger structure based on asymmetric alpha-divergence (AAD) is designed to reduce the communication rate of TCD-CPHD by adaptively calculating the time-trigger index; third, the fusion rule of AAD consensus is derived to construct the fusion process of the proposed DMT algorithm; finally, by combining the above structures and the fusion rule, the implementation processes of the proposed DMT algorithm are given.

Co-crystal screening of the four adamantane-based molecules with terephthalic acid was firstly attempted in mixed solvents. Only the compound with methylimidazole moieties (1) afforded the co-crystals in 1:1 ratio, whereas the others gave individual crystals. X-ray crystallographic analysis demonstrated that the hydrogen bonds between the imidazole and the carboxylic acid moieties of both components provided infinite one-dimensional chains that were assembled into network structures through CH center dot center dot center dot O interactions. When isophthalic acid or resorcinol was employed as the partner, the co-crystals were similarly generated by intermolecular non-covalent interactions. The selective co-crystal formation of 1 is mainly attributed to the increase of strength of the hydrogen-bonding acceptor on the nitrogen atoms of the N-heterocyclic moieties and the stabilization of the hydrogen-bonded complexes due to the electron-donating ability and the steric effect of the methyl groups.

Typically, 1-D features appear in the form of the single-mode scattering on the first spectral (energy) band in the resulting solvable model, but the analysis of multi-mode scattering is possible with our methodology. However, this comes at the price of assuming realistic (as opposed to quite general) matching between the scattering Ansatz in the wires and the solution of the Schrodinger equation on the vertex domain. Here this matching is based on a recently developed version of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We are further able to observe the transformation of the discrete spectrum of the Schrodinger operator on the vertex domain into the resonance features of the relevant scattering problem.

Sudha Anil; Manimaran, Govindarasu; Wang, Zhengdao			End-to-end energy management in networked real-time embedded systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS												Recent technological advances have opened up a wide range of distributed real-time applications involving battery-driven embedded devices with local processing and wireless communication capabilities. Some such applications include: wireless sensor networking, pervasive computing, and wireless industrial automation. Energy management is an integral part of the design and operation of such systems. In this work, we focus on the end-to-end energy management of data aggregation in distributed wireless sensor networks. Performing end-to-end energy management for the data aggregation application poses certain unique challenges particularly when the computational demands on the individual nodes are significant. In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing the total energy consumption of data aggregation with an end-to-end latency constraint while taking into account both the computational and communication workloads in the network. We consider a model where individual nodes support both Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) and Dynamic Modulation Scaling (DMS) power management techniques and explore the energy-time tradeoffs these techniques offer. Specifically, we make the following contributions in this paper. First, we present an analytical problem formulation for the ideal case where each node can scale its frequency and modulation continuously. Second, we present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to obtain the optimal solution for the practical case where only few discrete frequency and modulation levels are supported by each node. Further, we analyze the system-level energy-time tradeoffs considering both the computation and communication workloads by defining a novel energy gain metric. Finally, we present polynomial time heuristic algorithms, which employ the energy-gain metric. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithms for a variety of scenarios and our results show that the energy savings obtained by the proposed algorithms are comparable to that of the MILP solution.

Incorporating nanofillers into a polymer matrix to form mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) can elevate selectivity and permeability, but poor polymer -filler interfacial compatibility and filler aggregation are formidable problems. Targeting this, we propose a novel approach by incorporating a metal-organic framework (MOF) gel, ZIF-8 gel, as the versatile filler to a high free volume polymer PIM-1 and investigate the H2/CH4 separation capabilities of the MMMs. Benefiting from the gel network morphology of ZIF-8, they were dispersed evenly in the PIM-1 matrix. The interconnected gel network structure of ZIF-8 gel helped to construct continuous gas transport pathways in the polymer. As a result, the H2/CH4 separation performance was notably improved, demonstrating a substantial increase in H2 permeability by 78.9% (exceeding 6800 Barrer) and a 38.0% enhancement in H2/CH4 selectivity at a ZIF-8 gel loading of 31.0 wt%. These improvements surpassed the upper bound established in 2008. The Maxwell and Lewis -Nielsen models were developed to clarify gas transport mechanisms across membranes, and the experimental data of ZIF-8 gel/PIM-1 was well -matched with the calculated results of the Lewis -Nielsen models. Adopting MOF gel as fillers may pave a new approach to design high-performance MMMs with interconnected transport pathways.																			1385-8947	1873-3212				MAR 15	2024	484								149489	10.1016/j.cej.2024.149489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.149489		FEB 2024											WOS:001180829300001

The paradox often confuses people when it appears in data, and ignoring it may lead to incorrect decisions. Recent studies have found many examples of Simpson's paradox in social data and proposed a few methods to detect the paradox automatically. However, these methods suffer from many limitations, such as being only suitable for categorical variables or one specific paradox. To address these problems, we develop a learning-based approach to discover various Simpson's paradoxes. Firstly, we propose a framework from a statistical perspective that unifies multiple variants of Simpson's paradox currently known. Secondly, we present a novel loss function, Multi-group Pearson Correlation Coefficient (MPCC), to calculate the association strength of two variables of multiple subgroups. Then, we design a neural network model, coined SimNet, to automatically disaggregate data into multiple subgroups by optimizing the MPCC loss. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that SimNet can discover various Simpson's paradoxes caused by discrete and continuous variables, even hidden variables.

J	Wang, K; Chen, NC; Tong, DQ; Wang, K; Gong, JY				Wang, Ke; Chen, Nengcheng; Tong, Daoqin; Wang, Kai; Gong, Jianya			Optimizing the configuration of streamflow stations based on coverage maximization: A case study of the Jinsha River Basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Streamflow stations are typical hydrometric stations that serve as the basic components of hydrological monitoring networks. To effectively obtain information for predicting the magnitude and frequency of future floods and droughts, an optimal configuration of streamflow stations should be established to maximize the sensing capability with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a method to site streamflow stations in space to maximize the total area for streamflow monitoring. Considering the special regulations for deploying streamflow stations, a modified maximal covering location problem (MCLP) model is introduced. The effective coverage range of a streamflow station is determined based on the minimum density required and the site-specific terrain slope. The candidate sites are assumed to be continuously distributed along a river, and the river network is abstracted as a series of line-based river segments. The covering priority for each segment can be determined by the river length, the drainage area, or the level of flooding risk. The hydrometric network intersection point set (HNIPS) is proposed to identify finite candidate sites along a river. By narrowing the continuous search space to a discrete point set, this siting problem is solved using the MCLP-based model and HNIPS. The Jinsha River Basin is selected as a study area to test the proposed streamflow station siting method. Results show that the proposed method is effective in prescribing the optimal configuration of streamflow stations and the model solution achieves better coverage than that of the real-world deployment. The applicability of the proposed optimal siting method using HNIPS is analyzed. The criteria for candidate site selection and impacts of different weighting schemes applied to river segments are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the absence of network level coordination, the timing synchronization among D2D users will be unavailable, leading to inaccurate channel state estimation and device detection, especially in time-varying fading environments. In this paper, we design an asynchronous device detection/discovery framework for cognitive-D2D applications, which acquires timing drifts and dynamical fading channels when directly detecting the existence of a proximity D2D device (e.g. or primary user). To model and analyze this, a new dynamical system model is established, where the unknown timing deviation follows a random process, while the fading channel is governed by a discrete state Markov chain. To cope with the mixed estimation and detection problem, a novel sequential estimation scheme is proposed, using the conceptions of statistic Bayesian inference and random finite set. By tracking the unknown states (i.e. varying time deviations and fading gains) and suppressing the link uncertainty, the proposed scheme can effectively enhance the detection performance. The general framework, as a complimentary to a network-aided case with the coordinated signaling, provides the foundation for development of flexible D2D communications along with proximity-based spectrum sharing.

J	Tyagi, A; Mehra, R				Tyagi, Ankita; Mehra, Ritika			Intellectual heartbeats classification model for diagnosis of heart disease from ECG signal using hybrid convolutional neural network with GOA	SN APPLIED SCIENCES												Automatic heart disease detection from human heartbeats is a challenging and intellectual assignment in signal processing because periodically monitoring of the heart beat arrhythmia for patient is an essential task to reduce the death rate due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this paper, the focus of research is to design hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture by making use of Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to classify different types of heart diseases from the ECG signal or human heartbeats. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an artificial intelligence approach is widely used in computer vision-based medical data analysis. However, the traditional CNN cannot be used for classification of heart diseases from the ECG signal because lots of noise or irrelevant data is mixed with signal. So this study utilizes the pre-processing and selection of feature for proper heart diseases classification, where Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for the noise reduction as well as segmentation of ECG signal and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is used for selection of R-peaks features from the extracted feature sets in terms of R-peaks and R-R intervals that help to attain better classification accuracy. For training as well as testing of projected Heartbeats Classification Model (HCM), the Standard MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is utilized with hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The assortment of proper R-peaks and R-R intervals is a major factor and because of the deficiency of apposite pre-processing phases like noise removal, signal decomposition, smoothing and filtering, the uniqueness of extracted feature is less. The experimental outcomes show that the planned HCM is effective for detecting irregular human heartbeats via R-peaks and R-R intervals. When the proposed Heartbeats Classification Model (HCM) was verified on the database, model achieved higher efficiency than other state-of-the-art techniques for 16 heartbeat disease categories and the average classification accuracy is 99.58% with fast and robust responses where the correctly classified heartbeats are 86,005 and misclassified beats is only 108 with 0.42% error rate.

On one hand, this method is based on a continuous-time power-balanced state-space representation structured into its energy-storing parts, dissipative parts, and external sources. On the other hand, a numerical scheme is especially designed to preserve this structure and the power balance. These state-space structures define the class of port-Hamiltonian systems. The derivation of this structured system associated with the electronic circuit is achieved by an automated analysis of the interconnection network combined with a dictionary of models for each elementary component. The numerical scheme is based on the combination of finite differences applied on the state (with respect to the time variable) and on the total energy (with respect to the state). This combination provides a discrete-time version of the power balance. This set of algorithms is valid for both the linear and nonlinear case. Finally, three applications of increasing complexities are given: a diode clipper, a common-emitter bipolar-junction transistor amplifier, and a wah pedal. The results are compared to offline simulations obtained from a popular circuit simulator.

C	Xi, ZH; Pang, R; Ji, SL; Wang, T			USENIX Assoc	Xi, Zhaohan; Pang, Ren; Ji, Shouling; Wang, Ting			Graph Backdoor	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 30TH USENIX SECURITY SYMPOSIUM					30th USENIX Security Symposium	AUG 11-13, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	USENIX Assoc				One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent vulnerability to backdoor attacks - a trojan model responds to trigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning normally otherwise. Despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous data (e.g., images), the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for discrete-structured data (e.g., graphs) is largely unexplored, which is highly concerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge this gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with prior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented - it defines triggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and descriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary; input-tailored - it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby optimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic - it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or fine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible - it can be instantiated for both transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph classification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of security-critical applications. Through extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA. We further provide analytical justification for its effectiveness and discuss potential countermeasures, pointing to several promising research directions.

In the solid-state, the observed chain propagation axes are either colinear (1 and 3) or perpendicular (2), whereby crystal packing is further influenced by solvent molecules.

In particular, continuous time-based power system simulation and discrete event-based simulation of information and communication technology (ICT) networks are critical for investigating future smart grids. This paper presents the novel cosimulation environment INtegrated coSimulation of Power and ICT systems for Real-time Evaluation (INSPIRE) of power and ICT systems using the high-level architecture (HLA) (IEEE Std. 1516-2010). By applying the HLA standard, the environment is extendable to other simulation domains and a variety of functionalities and models, like thermal load models and additional third-party tools. Moreover, the HLA enables computational performance by distributed execution of each simulator on its own hardware and, thus, the applicability to realistic large-scale scenarios. INSPIRE has been designed under consideration of industrial standards [IEC 61850, object linking and embedding (OLE) for process control (OPC), and the common information model (CIM) (IEC 61968/61970)] in order to enhance interoperability, and to develop and validate solutions close to practice. The simulation results underline the interdependencies of power and ICT systems, and the necessity of an integrated analysis.

The most basic work of the Power CPS is to build an integration model which combines both a continuous process and a discrete process. The advanced form of smart grid, the Active Distribution Network (ADN) is a typical example of Power CPS. After designing the Power CPS model architecture and its application in ADN, a Hybrid System based model and control method of Power CPS is proposed in this paper. As an application example, ADN flexible load is modeled and controlled with ADN feeder power control by a control strategy which includes the normal condition and the underpowered condition. In this model and strategy, some factors like load power consumption and load functional demand are considered and optimized. In order to make up some of the deficiencies of centralized control, a distributed control method is presented to reduce model complexity and improve calculation speed. The effectiveness of all the models and methods are demonstrated in the case study.																				1996-1073				MAR	2017	10	3							267	10.3390/en10030267	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en10030267													WOS:000398736700007
J	Chen, WH; He, HH; Lu, XM; Deng, XQ				Chen, Wu-Hua; He, Haohua; Lu, Xiaomei; Deng, Xiaoqing			Impulsive observer-based design for state estimation of a class of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems with discrete measurements	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS												The state estimation problem of a class of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems with discrete measurements is investigated. The fast dynamics is assumed to be linear and exponentially stable. Under this assumption and some additional conditions, an asymptotic representation of the fast state is obtained in terms of the slow state and the known input. Then the full state estimation problem reduces to the slow state estimation problem. Based on this observation, an impulsive observer based estimation scheme is presented in the framework of singular perturbation. The continuous part of the proposed impulsive observer is a copy of the reduced-order slow dynamics of the observed system, while the impulse part is responsible for the implementation of the sample-triggered update of the observer state whenever a new sample of the output arrives. The estimation error is analyzed via a discontinuous Lyapunov function, and an epsilon-independent observer gain is designed. It is shown that the resulting estimation error exponentially converges towards an ultimate bound of order O(epsilon). The theoretical results are successfully applied to state estimates of Chua's circuit and a flexible link robot. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed state estimation scheme can achieve a desirable estimation accuracy for small enough epsilon > 0. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Proper server placement, considering the volume of service demands in different parts of the network, plays an important role in providing better services to users, more effective use of resources, and reducing the server's energy consumption. However, designing a model that can meet the requirements of both the users and the service providers has received less attention. Most researchers use discrete models to select candidate locations for resource deployment and servers can only be placed in these predefined locations. The proposed method explores the entire search area to find optimal locations for server placement with a continuous approach. To reduce the complexity of the problem and faster convergence in reaching the optimal solution, the resource deployment area is divided into smaller subregions. In the first step of the proposed method, the Butterfly optimization algorithm is used to find the best local locations for resource deployment. To avoid falling into the local optimum and to converge the subregions, the coral reefs optimization algorithm is used. The experiments show that the proposed method can effectively save energy and reduces network latency.

Based on a synchronous rotating frame PLL (SRF-PLL), multi-resonant harmonic compensators with the ability of accommodating frequency deviations are employed in the feedback path of a pre-filter. As a result, the negative-sequence component and harmonic distortions of grid voltage can be attenuated. Different from existing methods, only classical regulators are used, avoiding complicated networks for the decoupling of unbalance and harmonics and thus greatly simplifying the control algorithm. The proposed method is analysed and designed in both the continuous s-domain and discrete z-domain, whereby stable, fast, accurate, and robust responses are achieved.

Although the future of WSNs is very prospective, the security issues become more and more important because they are used for very critical applications in engineering areas. Furthermore, they are very vulnerable and thus attractive to attacks because of human-unattended deployment and their limited prices. Generally, they are protected by public key cryptosystems. Such systems depends on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithms or integer factorizations. However, they can be attacked by Shor's algorithm on quantum computers. Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC) schemes are secure to attacks by quantum computers. Among such schemes, multivariate signatures use various multiplications in a finite field, which are time-consuming operations during signature generations. Thus, we focus on improving multiplications in finite fields for multivariate signatures. We propose a variant of Mastrovito multiplications based on trinomial, Special Trinomial (ST), pentanomial, Special Pentanomial (SP), Equally-spaced-polynomial (ESP), All-One-polynomial (AOP), and successive-one-polynomial (SOP). Our design is implemented on hardware and can be used to improve the implementations of multivariate signatures including UOV, enTTS and Rainbow for protecting data security in WSNs.																			1064-1246	1875-8967					2019	37	4					4575	4584		10.3233/JIFS-179291	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JIFS-179291													WOS:000494280000020

However, modelling and understanding the generative process of graphs is challenging due to the discrete and high-dimensional nature of graphs, as well as permutation invariance to node orderings in underlying graph distributions. Current leading autoregressive models fail to capture the permutation invariance nature of graphs for the reliance on generation ordering and have high time complexity. Here, we propose a continuous-time generative diffusion process for permutation invariant graph generation to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we first construct a forward diffusion process defined by a stochastic differential equation (SDE), which smoothly converts graphs within the complex distribution to random graphs that follow a known edge probability. Solving the corresponding reverse-time SDE, graphs can be generated from newly sampled random graphs. To facilitate the reverse-time SDE, we newly design a position-enhanced graph score network, capturing the evolving structure and position information from perturbed graphs for permutation equivariant score estimation. Under the evaluation of comprehensive metrics, our proposed generative diffusion process achieves competitive performance in graph distribution learning. Experimental results also show that GraphGDP can generate high-quality graphs in only 24 function evaluations, much faster than previous autoregressive models.

The ETC of pebble beds in general depends on various parameters characterizing the bulk material and microstructural properties. Establishing correlations between the ETC and the governing system parameters through experiments is very expensive and not feasible in some cases as the particle scale data is not readily available. Hence, Thermal Discrete Element Method (TDEM) is employed in this paper to investigate the influence of various parameters on the effective thermal conductivity of pebble beds. Influence of parameters such as packing fraction, stress, bed temperature, pebble size and stagnant gas pressure on the ETC is investigated for lithium ceramic pebble beds in stagnant Helium/Air. Further, the variation of the ETC from the wall region to the bulk for pebble beds formed in prismatic containers is presented. Subsequently, dual phase pebble beds have been investigated to identify configurations that will enhance the ETC of the bed.

Inexact stabilized Benders' decomposition approaches with application to chance-constrained problems with finite support	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS												We explore modifications of the standard cutting-plane approach for minimizing a convex nondifferentiable function, given by an oracle, over a combinatorial set, which is the basis of the celebrated (generalized) Benders' decomposition approach. Specifically, we combine stabilization-in two ways: via a trust region in the norm, or via a level constraint-and inexact function computation (solution of the subproblems). Managing both features simultaneously requires a nontrivial convergence analysis; we provide it under very weak assumptions on the handling of the two parameters (target and accuracy) controlling the informative on-demand inexact oracle corresponding to the subproblem, strengthening earlier know results. This yields new versions of Benders' decomposition, whose numerical performance are assessed on a class of hybrid robust and chance-constrained problems that involve a random variable with an underlying discrete distribution, are convex in the decision variable, but have neither separable nor linear probabilistic constraints. The numerical results show that the approach has potential, especially for instances that are difficult to solve with standard techniques.					van Ackooij, Wim/AAF-1228-2020	van Ackooij, Wim/0000-0002-9943-3572; FRANGIONI, ANTONIO/0000-0002-5704-3170													0926-6003	1573-2894				DEC	2016	65	3					637	669		10.1007/s10589-016-9851-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10589-016-9851-z													WOS:000387773500004

Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of unobserved variables under given observations is one of the essential operations in CGM. Because the MAP inference problem is known to be NP-hard in general, the current mainstream approach is to solve an alternative problem obtained by approximating the objective function and applying continuous relaxation. However, this approach has two significant drawbacks. First, the quality of the solution deteriorates when the values in the count data are negligible due to the inaccuracy of Stirling's approximation. Second, the application of continuous relaxation causes the violation of integrality constraints. This paper proposes novel algorithms for MAP inference in CGMs on path graphs to overcome these problems. Our method is based on the discrete difference of convex algorithm (DCA); DCA is a general framework to minimize the sum of a convex function and a concave function by repeatedly minimizing surrogate functions. Utilizing the particular structure of path graphs, we efficiently solve the surrogate function minimization by minimum convex cost flow algorithms. Furthermore, our approach also leads to a new method of solving another important task; MAP inference of the sample size in CGM on path graphs. Our method is naturally applicable to this task, allowing us to design very efficient algorithms. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

J	Ushijima, TT; Yeh, WWG; Wong, WK				Ushijima, Timothy T.; Yeh, William W. G.; Wong, Weng Kee			Constructing robust and efficient experimental designs in groundwater modeling using a Galerkin method, proper orthogonal decomposition, and metaheuristic algorithms	PLOS ONE												Estimating parameters accurately in groundwater models for aquifers is challenging because the models are non-explicit solutions of complex partial differential equations. Modern research methods, such as Monte Carlo methods and metaheuristic algorithms, for searching an efficient design to estimate model parameters require hundreds, if not thousands of model calls, making the computational cost prohibitive. One method to circumvent the problem and gain valuable insight on the behavior of groundwater is to first apply a Galerkin method and convert the system of partial s governing the flow to a discrete problem and then use a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to project the high-dimensional model space of the original groundwater model to create a reduced groundwater model with much lower dimensions. The reduced model can be solved several orders of magnitude faster than the full model and able to provide an accurate estimate of the full model. The task is still challenging because the optimization problem is non-convex, non-differentiable and there are continuous variables and integer-valued variables to optimize. Following convention, heuristic algorithms and a combination is used search to find efficient designs for the reduced groundwater model using various optimality criteria. The main goals are to introduce new design criteria and the concept of design efficiency for experimental design research in hydrology. The two criteria have good utility but interestingly, do not seem to have been implemented in hydrology. In addition, design efficiency is introduced. Design efficiency is a method to assess how robust a design is under a change of criteria. The latter is an important issue because the design criterion may be subjectively selected and it is well known that an optimal design can perform poorly under another criterion. It is thus desirable that the implemented design has relatively high efficiencies under a few criteria. As applications, two heuristic algorithms are used to find optimal designs for a small synthetic aquifer design problem and a design problem for a large-scale groundwater model and assess their robustness properties to other optimality criteria. The results show the proof of concept is workable for finding a more informed and efficient model-based design for a water resource study.

All Possible Topologies of the Fractional-Order Wien Oscillator Family Using Different Approximation Techniques	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING												This paper introduces all the possible topologies of the Wien bridge oscillator family. This family has 72 topologies, 24 of them contain only RC or RL pairs, and the rest contain mixed pairs. The complete mathematical analysis of all twelve possible capacitive-based topologies is proposed in the fractional-order domain. The investigated circuits can be categorized into two groups, each with a similar characteristic equation. Three integer-order approximation techniques for the Laplacian operator s alpha are employed to solve and simulate the Wien bridge system. The studied approximations are those of Matsuda, Oustaloup, and Valsa's network. Fractional-order capacitor (FOC) emulators are built using these approximations and applied in the circuit simulation. Comparisons are made on different levels, starting with the mathematical solution of the characteristic equation, followed by PSpice simulation, which compares topologies of the Wien bridge oscillator family. Hardware implementation of the FOC emulators is presented applying passive discrete components using the Foster-I technique. Additionally, sensitivity tests of the discrete components of the FOC emulators are performed using Monte Carlo analysis. Experimental results are introduced to validate the theoretical findings.					said, Lobna/ABD-9224-2021; Radwan, Ahmed G./G-8908-2011; Madian, Ahmed/ABH-5459-2020	said, Lobna/0000-0001-8223-4625; Radwan, Ahmed G./0000-0002-6119-8482; Madian, Ahmed/0000-0001-8313-8088; radwan, ahmed/0000-0001-6079-4138													0278-081X	1531-5878				SEP	2019	38	9					3931	3951		10.1007/s00034-019-01057-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00034-019-01057-6													WOS:000485084300002
J	Kody, A; Scruggs, J				Kody, Alyssa; Scruggs, Jeff			MPC Trajectory Feasibility Constraints for Self-Powered Control Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												A self-powered control system derives the energy to power its operation entirely from the dynamics of the plant in which it is embedded. Each actuator is a transducer capable of injecting energy into, as well as removing energy from, the plant. Removed energy is stored for reuse in rechargeable energy storage subsystems. Control inputs are physically constrained by the requirement that the system does not exhaust these energy storage subsystems. This article analyzes model-predictive control (MPC) trajectory feasibility for self-powered control systems. Specifically, we examine the case in which the MPC algorithm formulates a discrete-time zero-order-hold control trajectory, for which the energy constraints are approximately enforced by using response information only at discrete sample times. It is shown that continuous-time control feasibility can be ensured by conservatively overbounding the transmission loss model. The analysis is conducted both for the case in which future disturbances are known deterministically and the case in which they are uncertain but bounded.

J	Hu, L; Zhu, HW; Hua, J				Hu, Lei; Zhu, Hongwu; Hua, Jian			DEM study on effects of particle size and grinding media properties on energy transitions in a horizontal agitator	ADVANCED POWDER TECHNOLOGY												Thermal-mechanical cuttings cleaner, utilizing the energy dissipation of dense particle flow in the mill, is a type of low-temperature method for drying drill cuttings. In this paper, the energy dissipations of particle flow at the particle scale are simulated via discrete element method in a horizontal agitator. The effect of the particle diameter of sample particle and grinding media properties are considered in the simulation. The velocity distributions, contact force, input torque of the mill, and power dissipation of each component are employed to assess energy transitions. The results reveal that the contact force network in the bed is the main factor affecting the momentum transfer, and the motion and power dissipation are sharply promoted by the presence of grinding beads. The density of grinding beads has a significant effect on the permeability of grinding beads in sample particles and the consequent energy dissipation.

J	Ensafian, H; Yaghoubi, S; Yazdi, MM				Ensafian, Hamidreza; Yaghoubi, Saeed; Yazdi, Mohammad Modarres			Raising quality and safety of platelet transfusion services in a patient-based integrated supply chain under uncertainty	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This paper develops a stochastic multi-period mixed-integer model for collection, production, storage, and distribution of platelet in Blood Transfusion Organizations ranging from blood collection centers to clinical points. In this model, the age of platelet and ABO-Rh priority matching rules are incorporated based on the type of patient to raise the quality and safety of platelet transfusion services. At first, a discrete Markov Chain Process is applied to predict the number of donors. Afterwards, the uncertain demand is captured using a two-stage stochastic programming. A challenging aspect of applying stochastic programming in a dynamic setting is to construct an appropriate set of discrete scenarios. Therefore, we introduce an improved approach for scenario reduction which well represents multivariate stochastic processes for uncertain parameters. To manage risk, a straightforward approach to reduce the expected value and variance of cost is proposed. Finally, management strategies inspired from a real case study are presented.

The discrete models are basexl on a varying decentralization degree, namely, the agents' individual abstractions are obtained by using discrete information up to a tunable distance in their network graph. Deriving these models at the agent level is essential to address scalability issues which appear in the discretization of systems with a high state dimension. The approach builds on the appropriate discretization of the agents' state space and the selection of a transition time step, which enable the construction of a nonblocking transition system for each agent with quantifiable transition possibilities. The transitions are based on the design of local feedback laws for the manipulation of the coupling terms, which guarantee the execution of the transitions by the continuous systems. For a class of nonlinear agent interconnections, the derivation of such abstractions is always guaranteed, based on sufficient conditions which relate the agents' dynamics and the space/time quantization.																			0363-0129	1095-7138					2019	57	5					3471	3495		10.1137/17M1133981	http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/17M1133981													WOS:000493904200015

Can we design online interventions that will help humans achieve certain goals in such asynchronous setting? In this paper, we address the above problem from the perspective of deep reinforcement learning of marked temporal point processes, where both the actions taken by an agent and the feedback it receives from the environment are asynchronous stochastic discrete events characterized using marked temporal point processes. In doing so, we define the agent's policy using the intensity and mark distribution of the corresponding process and then derive a flexible policy gradient method, which embeds the agent' s actions and the feedback it receives into real-valued vectors using deep recurrent neural networks. Our method does not make any assumptions on the functional form of the intensity and mark distribution of the feedback and it allows for arbitrarily complex reward functions. We apply our methodology to two different applications in personalized teaching and viral marketing and, using data gathered from Duolingo and Twitter, we show that it may be able to find interventions to help learners and marketers achieve their goals more effectively than alternatives.

J	GROSSBERG, S				GROSSBERG, S			DECISIONS, PATTERNS, AND OSCILLATIONS IN NON-LINEAR COMPETITIVE SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS TO VOLTERRA-LOTKA SYSTEMS	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												New properties of competitive systems which arise in population biology, ecology, psychophysiology and developmental biology are described. [These systems can be used in studying humans or general organisms.] These properties yield a global method for analyzing the geometric design and qualitative behavior, e.g., limits or oscillations, of competitive systems. The method explicates a main theme about competitive systems: who is winning the competition? The systems can undergo a complicated series of discrete decisions, or jumps, whose structure can, i.e., yield global pattern formation or sustained oscillations, as in the voting paradox. The method illustrates how a parallel continuous system can be analyzed in terms of discrete serial operations, but notes that the next operation can be predicted only from the parallel interactions. Binary approximations to sigmoid signals in nonlinear networks are not apparently valid. How a temporal series of nested dynamic boundaries can be induced by purely nonlinear interactive effects is also shown. These boundaries restrict the fluctuations of population sizes or activities to ever finer intervals. The method can be used where Lyapunov methods fail and often obviates the need for local stability analysis. Some previous results on the voting paradox are strengthened and corrected.																			0022-5193	1095-8541					1978	73	1					101	130		10.1016/0022-5193(78)90182-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-5193(78)90182-0								692143					WOS:A1978FL58100006

The planning process requires processing a large amount of data and different parameters when choosing the best event venue. Social media captures a large number of fan actions per day. This paper describes the process of selecting the most appropriate cities to organize events, aided by data collected from social media. The problem is defined as a combinatorial optimization problem. A modified metaheuristic Bat algorithm was proposed, implemented, and described in detail to solve the problem. Although the original Bat algorithm is designed to solve continuous optimization problems, the implemented bat algorithm is adapted to solve the defined problem. The algorithm is compared to the exhaustive search method for smaller instances, and to the greedy and genetic algorithm for larger instances. The algorithm was tested on benchmark data on cities in 20 European countries, as well as on real data collected from pages on the social network Facebook. Bat algorithm has shown superior results compared to other techniques, both in time and in the quality of the solutions generated.

Network meta-analysis combining individual patient and aggregate data from a mixture of study designs with an application to pulmonary arterial hypertension	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY												Background: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a methodology for indirectly comparing, and strengthening direct comparisons of two or more treatments for the management of disease by combining evidence from multiple studies. It is sometimes not possible to perform treatment comparisons as evidence networks restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may be disconnected. We propose a Bayesian NMA model that allows to include single-arm, before-and-after, observational studies to complete these disconnected networks. We illustrate the method with an indirect comparison of treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Methods: Our method uses a random effects model for placebo improvements to include single-arm observational studies into a general NMA. Building on recent research for binary outcomes, we develop a covariate-adjusted continuous-outcome NMA model that combines individual patient data (IPD) and aggregate data from two-arm RCTs with the single-arm observational studies. We apply this model to a complex comparison of therapies for PAH combining IPD from a phase-III RCT of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH and aggregate data from RCTs and single-arm observational studies, both identified by a systematic review. Results: Through the inclusion of observational studies, our method allowed the comparison of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH with other treatments. This comparison had not been previously possible due to the limited RCT evidence available. However, the credible intervals of our posterior estimates were wide so the overall results were inconclusive. The comparison should be treated as exploratory and should not be used to guide clinical practice. Conclusions: Our method for the inclusion of single-arm observational studies allows the performance of indirect comparisons that had previously not been possible due to incomplete networks composed solely of available RCTs. We also built on many recent innovations to enable researchers to use both aggregate data and IPD. This method could be used in similar situations where treatment comparisons have not been possible due to restrictions to RCT evidence and where a mixture of aggregate data and IPD are available.

However, most existing works focus on attacking the image classification problem since its input space is continuous and output space is finite. In this paper. we study the much more challenging problem of crafting adversarial examples for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, whose inputs are discrete text strings and outputs have an almost infinite number of possibilities. To address the challenges caused by the discrete input space. we propose a projected gradient method combined with group lasso and gradient regularization. To handle the almost infinite output space, we design some novel loss functions to conduct non-overlapping attack and targeted keyword attack. We apply our algorithm to machine translation and text summarization tasks, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm: by changing less than 3 words, we can make seq2seq model to produce desired outputs with high success rates. We also use an external sentiment classifier to verify the property of preserving semantic meanings for our generated adversarial examples. On the other hand, we recognize that, compared with the well-evaluated CNN-based classifiers, seq2seq models are intrinsically more robust to adversarial attacks.

Comprehensive tobacco control has reduced smoking rates in Australia from approximately 34 per cent in 1980 to 15 per cent in 2010. However, 46 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (Indigenous Australians) smoke on a daily basis, more than double the rate of non-Indigenous Australians. The evidence of effective tobacco control strategies for Indigenous Australians is relatively scarce. The aim of this study is to (i) explore the influences of smoking in Indigenous Australian people and to (ii) help inform and evaluate a multi-component tobacco control strategy. The study aims to answer the following questions: -do individuals' social networks influence smoking behaviours; - is there an association between various social and cultural factors and being a smoker or non-smoker; and - does a multi-component tobacco control program impact positively on tobacco behaviours, attitudes and beliefs in Indigenous Australians. Methods and design: Our prospective study will use a mixed-method approach (qualitative and quantitative), including a pre- and post-test evaluation of a tobacco control initiative. The study will explore the social and cultural context underlying Indigenous Australian tobacco use and associated factors which influence smoking behaviour. Primary data will be collected via a panel survey, interviews and focus groups. Secondary data will include de-identified PBS items related to smoking and also data collected from the Quitlines call service. Network analysis will be used to assess whether social networks influence smoking behaviours. For the survey, baseline differences will be tested using chi(2) statistics for the categorical and dichotomous variables and t-tests for the continuous variables, where appropriate. Grounded theory will be used to analyse the interviews and focus groups. Local Aboriginal community controlled organisations will partner in the study. Discussion: Our study will explore the key factors, including the influence of social networks, that impact on tobacco use and the extent to which smoking behaviours transcend networks within the Indigenous Australian community in the ACT. This will add to the evidence-base, identifying influential factors to tobacco use and the effectiveness and influence of a multi-component tobacco control strategy.

The method addresses plant synthesis and analysis for multistep processes, processes where multiple reactions occur in both series and parallel, and where interstitial separation operations may be required. The method is tailored for the initial stages of process design, whereupon limited development of the process flowsheet has occurred, and estimation of plant economic viability is required. The chemical process is modeled as an interconnected graph linking chemical component nodes to operating sections. A mixed integer non linear program is utilized to obtain 'best' flowsheet configurations with initial mass balances and estimations for reactor parameters. The method is illustrated by examining large scale continuous processes, with the hydrodealkylation of toluene (HDA) process and a multistage chloromethanes process presented as case studies.

In this paper, new software-based methodologies were developed for locating multiple leaks in a natural gas pipeline. Two types of multiple leaks, subsequent and simultaneous multiple leaks, from a natural gas pipeline were studied, separately. For both subsequent and simultaneous leaks, case studies with two leak occurrences were demonstrated using MATLAB simulation. For detecting and locating subsequent multiple leaks, an unknown input observer was designed and applied, which was modified from our previous study. New Optimization methodology for locating simultaneous multiple leaks was demonstrated. Leak locations were estimated by solving a nonlinear global optimization problem. The global optimization problem contained constraints of partial differential equations, integer, and continuous variables. A new discretization approach was proposed and demonstrated, which required significant less computation effect comparing to conventional global optimization algorithms.

Here we present an overview of additional applications of statistics in plant pathology. An analysis of variance based on the assumption of normally distributed responses with equal variances has been a standard approach in biology for decades. Advances in statistical theory and computation now make it convenient to appropriately deal with discrete responses using generalized linear models, with adjustments for overdispersion as needed. New nonparametric approaches are available for analysis of ordinal data such as disease ratings. Many experiments require the use of models with fixed and random effects for data analysis. New or expanded computing packages, such as SAS PROC MIXED, coupled with extensive advances in statistical theory, allow for appropriate analyses of normally distributed data using linear mixed models, and discrete data with generalized linear mixed models. Decision theory offers a framework in plant pathology for contexts such as the decision about whether to apply or withhold a treatment. Model selection can be performed using Akaike's information criterion. Plant pathologists studying pathogens at the population level have traditionally been the main consumers of statistical approaches in plant pathology, but new technologies such as microarrays supply estimates of gene expression for thousands of genes simultaneously and present challenges for statistical analysis. Applications to the study of the landscape of the field and of the genome share the risk of pseudoreplication, the problem of determining the appropriate scale of the experimental unit and of obtaining sufficient replication at that scale.

J	Otey, ME; Ghoting, A; Parthasarathy, S				Otey, ME; Ghoting, A; Parthasarathy, S			Fast distributed outlier detection in mixed-attribute data sets	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY												Efficiently detecting outliers or anomalies is an important problem in many areas of science, medicine and information technology. Applications range from data cleaning to clinical diagnosis, from detecting anomalous defects in materials to fraud and intrusion detection. Over the past decade, researchers in data mining and statistics have addressed the problem of outlier detection using both parametric and non-parametric approaches in a centralized setting. However, there are still several challenges that must be addressed. First, most approaches to date have focused on detecting outliers in a continuous attribute space. However, almost all real-world data sets contain a mixture of categorical and continuous attributes. Categorical attributes are typically ignored or incorrectly modeled by existing approaches, resulting in a significant loss of information. Second, there have not been any general-purpose distributed outlier detection algorithms. Most distributed detection algorithms are designed with a specific domain (e.g. sensor networks) in mind. Third, the data sets being analyzed may be streaming or otherwise dynamic in nature. Such data sets are prone to concept drift, and models of the data must be dynamic as well. To address these challenges, we present a tunable algorithm for distributed outlier detection in dynamic mixed-attribute data sets.

A scenario tree-based scheme is used to represent the Deterministic Equivalent Model of the stochastic mixed 0-1 program with complete recourse. The constraints are modeled by a splitting variable representation via scenarios. So, a mixed 0-1 model for each scenario cluster is considered, plus the nonanticipativity constraints that equate the 0-1 and continuous so-called common variables from the same group of scenarios in each stage. Given the high dimensions of the stochastic instances in the real world, it is not realistic to obtain the optimal solution for the problem. Instead we use the so-called Fix-and-Relax Coordination (FRC) algorithm to exploit the characteristics of the nonanticipativity constraints of the stochastic model. A mixture of the FRC approach and the Lagrangian Substitution and Decomposition schemes is proposed for satisfying, both, the integrality constraints for the 0-1 variables and the nonanticipativity constraints.

Data efficient reinforcement learning and adaptive optimal perimeter control of network traffic dynamics	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												Existing data-driven and feedback traffic control strategies do not consider the heterogeneity of real-time data measurements. Besides, traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods for traffic control usually converge slowly for lacking data efficiency. Moreover, conventional optimal perimeter control schemes require exact knowledge of the system dynamics and thus they would be fragile to endogenous uncertainties. To handle these challenges, this work proposes an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) based approach to learning the macroscopic traffic dynamics for adaptive optimal perimeter control. This work makes the following primary contributions to the transportation literature: (a) A continuous-time control is developed with discrete gain updates to adapt to the discrete-time sensor data. Different from the conventional RL approaches, the reinforcement interval of the proposed IRL method can be varying with respect to the real-time resolution of data measurements. Approximate optimization methods are carried out to address the curse of dimensionality of the optimal control problem with consideration on the resolution of data measurement. (b) To reduce the sampling complexity and use the available data more efficiently, the experience replay (ER) technique is introduced to the IRL algorithm. (c) The proposed method relaxes the requirement on model calibration in a "model-free"manner that enables robustness against modeling uncertainty and enhances the real-time performance via a data-driven RL algorithm. (d) The convergence of the IRL based algorithms and the stability of the controlled traffic dynamics are proven via the Lyapunov theory. The optimal control law is parameterized and then approximated by neural networks (NN), which moderates the computational complexity. Both state and input constraints are considered while no model linearization is required. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

ABCD-L's models can be used in conjunction with existing techniques for Boolean synthesis/verification/fast logic simulation, or with hybrid systems frameworks, to represent LTI dynamics without incurring the penalty of adding continuous variables. Unlike existing state-enumeration approaches like DAE2FSM [1], ABCD-L scales practically linearly with system size. We apply ABCD-L to I/O links composed of RC/RLGC units, capturing important analog effects like inter-symbol interference, overshoot/undershoot, ringing, etc. - all using purely Boolean models. We also present a continuous-time differential equalizer example, where ABCD-L accurately reproduces key design-relevant AMS metrics, including the eye diagram correction achieved by the circuit. Furthermore, for real-world LTI systems, we demonstrate that ABCD-L can be applied in conjunction with Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques; we use this to produce accurate Boolean models of an industry-scale power grid network (with 25849 nodes) made available by IBM. We also demonstrate that Boolean simulation using ABCD-L's models offers considerable speed-up over standard circuit simulation using linear multi-step numerical methods.																			0738-100X		978-1-4503-2071-9				2013																								WOS:000325822100062
J	Hui, JW				Hui, Jiuwu			Discrete-time integral terminal sliding mode load following controller coupled with disturbance observer for a modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor	ENERGY												With the appearance of digital computers and microprocessor technologies, the control systems used in nuclear reactors continue to transform from analog devices to digital ones in recent years. A heavy challenge is that applying the pre-existing intelligent load following control algorithms developed in the continuous -time domain to the current digital devices of the nuclear reactors may yield the so-called digital chattering effects, and even trigger system instability. To this end, this paper presents a discrete -time integral terminal sliding mode controller (DTITSMC) coupled with a discrete -time disturbance observer (DTDO) for the load following of a modular high -temperature gas-cooled reactor (MHTGR). The common continuous -time MHTGR model is first transformed into a discrete -time form with consideration of model uncertainties, exogenous disturbances, and discretization errors. Then, on the basis of this discrete -time MHTGR model, a DTDO that can estimate the lumped disturbances, composed of model uncertainties, exogenous disturbances, discretization errors, and unmeasured system states, is developed, subsequently being combined with the designed DTITSMC scheme in order to enhance the system robustness. The proposed DTITSMC scheme coupled with the DTDO is novel in that it can be directly implemented on the digital control system of the MHTGR, while at the same time providing an improved load following control performance, owing to the integration of the state-of-the-art sliding mode control techniques, backstepping control techniques, and the disturbance feedforward compensation supported by the disturbance observer techniques. Both the estimation error convergence of the DTDO and the overall system stability are theoretically proved by the Lyapunov stability theory in this paper. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed DTITSMC scheme coupled with the DTDO over the previous discrete -time linear sliding mode controller (DTLSMC) and discrete -time proportional-integral-derivative controller (DTPIDC) are further confirmed by simulation studies, where in the absence of lumped disturbances, the value of the accumulative absolute load error (AALE) produced by the proposed DTSMPPC scheme coupled with the DTDO is merely 0.0575% and 0.2675% to that of the previous DTLSMC and the optimized DTPIDC, respectively, while in the presence of lumped disturbances, the value of the AALE produced by the proposed DTSMPPC scheme coupled with the DTDO is merely 0.006% and 0.1952% to that of the previous DTLSMC and the optimized DTPIDC, respectively.																			0360-5442	1873-6785				APR 1	2024	292								130479	10.1016/j.energy.2024.130479	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.130479		FEB 2024											WOS:001177630500001

In order to fulfill customers' needs, the actors in a Supply Chain (SC) network sometimes compete and sometimes cooperate with each other. In SC management, both competitive and collaborative strategies have become important and have required different points of view. In a collaborative environment, companies should strive for common targets with mutual relationship. After managers decided to share their resources, some positive effects have appeared on the companies and suppliers' performance such as profitability, flexibility and efficiency. Consequently, many companies are willing to cooperate with each other in a SC network because of these reasons. On the other hand, Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) management has been attracting a growing interest because of increased environmental issues, government regulations and customer pressures. Based on this initiative, our paper presents a novel allied CLSC network design model with two different SCs including common suppliers and common collection centers. First, a decentralized multi-level Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that consists of two different levels of Decision Makers (DMs) is developed. The plants of common SCs comprise the upper-level DMs, common suppliers, common collection centers, and the logistics firm comprises the lower-level DMs. A novel Interactive Fuzzy Programming (IFP) approach using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed to obtain a preferred compromise solution for the developed model. Through use of Fuzzy AHP in the proposed IFP approach, the DMs can identify the importance of the lower-level DMs. In order to validate the developed model and the proposed IFP approach, a numerical example is implemented. According to the obtained results, our proposed IFP method outperforms Sakawa and Nishizaki's(1) and Calik et al.' s(2) approach with respect to the satisfaction degrees of upper-level DMs for the developed CLSC model.

J	Dong, JP; Zhang, GX; Luo, B; Rong, HA				Dong, Jianping; Zhang, Gexiang; Luo, Biao; Rong, Haina			An optimization numerical spiking neural P system for solving constrained optimization problems	INFORMATION SCIENCES												An optimization spiking neural P (OSN P) system is a discrete optimization model without the aid of evolutionary operators of evolutionary algorithms or swarm intelligence algorithms. However, since the processing object of OSN P systems is a spike, where information is encoded by the timing of spikes or the number of spikes in neurons, OSN P systems are limited for solving continuous optimization problems. To break this limitation, an extended numerical spiking neural (ENSN P) system is proposed based on numerical spik-ing neural P (NSN P) systems and multiple (ENSN P) systems, called optimization numer-ical spiking neural P systems (ONSN P systems or ONSNPS), are designed to solve continuous constrained optimization problems. More specifically, in ENSN P systems, the production functions are selected by probability to achieve updated parameters. In OSN P systems, a guider algorithm is introduced to finish individuals' crossover and selection. The extensively experimental results in five benchmarks, thirty-two optimization prob-lems including five benchmark problems, seventeen manufacturing design optimization problems and ten benchmarks from CEC show that ONSN P systems in this paper outper-form or are competitive to twenty-eight optimization algorithms. Finally, algorithm complexity and Holm-Bonferroni procedure based on statistical results is used to test the complexity changing when we use different dimensionality of the search space and the dif-ference in terms of statistical performance. The testing results indicate that the time complexity of ONSN P systems grows linearly with problem dimensions and ONSN P systems are better performance than the most algorithms.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

This simulation mode relies on an equation solving engine which must deal effectively with nonsmooth and constrained relations which are often enforced as procedures in the sequential modular mode. Also, with complex flowsheet topologies and output specifications due to design or optimization calculations, conditional and nonsmooth relations introduce derivative discontinuities into the problem which frequently cause these solvers to fail. In an earlier paper (Bullard and Biegler, Computers chem Engng 15, 4, 1991) we introduced an iterated linear programming (LP) based approach for solving the constrained simulation problem. The present article proposes two related approaches to handle a general class of nonsmooth problems. The first uses continuous variables while the second also includes binary variables. These approaches are demonstrated on a number of examples, including pipeline network flow problems containing check valves which may either be on or off, flow transitions from laminar to turbulent and equidistribution problems which minimize the absolute value of the approximation error.

Lagrangian decomposition approach to scheduling large-scale refinery operations	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This work focuses on the scheduling of refinery operations from crude oil processing to the blending and dispatch of finished products. A new algorithm for Lagrangian decomposition (LD) is proposed and applied to realistic large scale refinery scheduling problem to evaluate its efficiency. A novel strategy is presented to formulate restricted relaxed sub-problems based on the solution of the Lagrangian relaxed sub-problems that take into consideration the continuous process characteristic of the refinery. This new algorithm, referred to as restricted Lagrangian decomposition algorithm, the best lower bound is obtained amongst the restricted-relaxed sub-problems and relaxed sub-problems in each iteration. The goal of the decomposition is to produce better solutions for those integrated scheduling problems that cannot be solved in reasonable computation times. The application of the proposed algorithm results in substantial reduction in CPU solution time, duality gap, and the total number of iterations compared to classical LD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to high photosynthetic efficiency, microalgae are considered as a potential feedstock for next-generations biofuel conversion processes. This paper addresses the thermochemical conversion of highly diluted microalgae feedstock into synthetic natural gas (SNG) through supercritical hydrothermal gasification. The complete conversion chain is modeled including the cultivation phase, settling ponds, centrifuges, catalytic hydrothermal gasification with salt separation unit and SNG purification system. Thermodynamic, economic and environmental models are considered for each process step, in order to solve a Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) optimization problem. The problem is solved by applying a two steps decomposition approach, using Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). It is finally demonstrated that coupling microalgae cultivation systems with hydrothermal gasification (HTG) and waste energy recovery utilities leads to high energy/exergy efficiencies, emissions reduction and globally better sustainable processes.

In addition, conventional cloud technology cannot adhere to the delay requirement of sensitive IIoT applications due to long-distance data travel. To address this bottleneck, we design a novel energy-delay optimization framework called transmission scheduling and computation offloading (TSCO), while maintaining energy and delay constraints in the fog environment. To achieve this objective, we first present a heuristic-based transmission scheduling strategy to transfer IIoT-generated tasks based on their importance. Moreover, we also introduce a graph-based task-offloading strategy using constrained-restricted mixed linear programming to handle high traffic in rush-hour scenarios. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed TSCO approach significantly optimizes energy consumption and delay up to 12%-17% during computation and communication over the traditional baseline algorithms.

In conjunction with mixed-integer programming, classical Lyapunov-based arguments are used to find the minimal sensor configuration such that the NDS internal states can be observed while still optimizing some estimation metrics. The paper's approach is based on two phases. The first phase assumes that the encompassed nonlinearities belong to one of the following function set classifications: bounded Jacobian, Lipschitz continuous, one-sided Lipschitz, or quadratically inner-bounded. To parameterize these classifications, two approaches based on stochastic point-based and interval-based optimization methods are explored. Given the parameterization, the second phase formulates the sensor placement problem for various NDS classes through mixed-integer convex programming. The theoretical optimality of the sensor placement alongside a state estimator design are then given. Numerical tests on traffic network models showcase that the proposed approach yields sensor placements that are consistent with conventional wisdom in traffic theory.

Delay-dependent stability and stabilizability conditions for the closed-loop continuous nonuniformly sampled-data fuzzy systems are derived by constructing a novel discontinuous Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional, which makes good use of not only the upper bound on the variable sampling interval, but also its sawtooth structure information about varying input delay often ignored in previous results. A bounding technique combined by reciprocally convex technics and linear convex combination is presented for acquiring the time derivative of the functional, wherein Jensen's inequality and Wirtinger's inequality are integratively employed. And a feasible solution of the obtained criterion formulated as parameterized linear matrix inequalities is ultimately conceived. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.					wang, ying/GQY-5077-2022; Yang, Feisheng/AAI-4353-2020; Yang, Feisheng/I-5931-2013														0924-090X	1573-269X				FEB	2014	75	3					501	512		10.1007/s11071-013-1080-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-013-1080-8													WOS:000330735900008

Damage starts as soon as the pavement is open to traffic and increases with time. If maintenance activities are not considered in the initial design or considered but not applied during the service life, damage will grow to a point where rehabilitation may be the only and most expensive option left. In order to monitor the evolution of damage and its severity in pavement structures, a novel data compression approach based on cumulative measurements from a piezoelectric sensor is presented in this paper. Specifically, the piezoelectric sensor uses a thin film of polyvinylidene fluoride to sense the energy produced by the micro deformation generated due to the application of traffic loads. Epoxy solution has been used to encapsulate the membrane providing hardness and flexibility to withstand the high-loads and the high-temperatures during construction of the asphalt layer. The piezoelectric sensors have been exposed to three months of loading (approximately 1.0 million loads of 65 kN) at the French Institute of Science and Technology for Transport, Development and Networks (IFSTTAR) fatigue carrousel. Notably, the sensors survived the construction and testing. Reference measurements were made with a commercial conventional strain gauge specifically designed for measurements in hot mix asphalt layers. Results from the carrousel successfully demonstrate that the novel approach can be considered as a good indicator of damage progression, thus alleviating the need to measure strains in pavement for the purpose of damage tracking.

The continuing development of mixed and augmented reality (MR/AR) on head-mounted displays (HMDs) furthers the richness of this experience by providing users a continuous vision experience, where visual information continuously provides context, and the real world is augmented by the virtual. However, these visual applications raise serious privacy concerns because they can capture private user information. To understand user privacy concerns in continuous vision computing environments, we study three MR/AR applications (augmented markers, augmented faces, and text capture). We show that in modern mobile visual applications, typical users are exposed to potential mass collection of sensitive information. To address such deficiencies, we develop a framework that provides resource isolation between user information contained in camera frames and application access to the network. We implement the design as a proof of concept on the Android operating system and demonstrate its performance and usability with a modern state-of-the-art augmented reality library and several augmented reality applications. By comparing the applications from our case study with modified versions which better protect user privacy, results show that our design efficiently protects users against data collection in MR/AR applications with less than 0.7% performance overhead.

Effective sourcing strategies for perishable product supply chains	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess whether an existing sourcing strategy can effectively supply products of appropriate quality with acceptable levels of product waste if applied to an international perishable product supply chain. The authors also analyse whether the effectiveness of this sourcing strategy can be improved by including costs for expected shelf life losses while generating order policies. Design/methodology/approach - The performance of sourcing strategies is examined in a prototype international strawberry supply chain. Appropriate order policies were determined using parameters both with and without costs for expected shelf life losses. Shelf life losses during transport and storage were predicted using microbiological growth models. The performance of the resulting policies was assessed using a hybrid discrete event chain simulation model that includes continuous quality decay. Findings - The study's findings reveal that the order policies obtained with standard cost parameters result in poor product quality and large amounts of product waste. Also, including costs for expected shelf life losses in sourcing strategies significantly reduces product waste and improves product quality, although transportation costs rise. Practical implications - The study shows that in perishable product supply chain design a trade-off should be made between transportation costs, shortage costs, inventory costs, product waste, and expected shelf life losses. Originality/value - By presenting a generically applicable methodology for perishable product supply chain design, the authors contribute to research and practice efforts to reduce food waste. Furthermore, product quality information is included in supply chain network design, a research area that is still in its infancy.

The Impact of Medicaid Managed Care Plan Type on Continuous Medicaid Enrollment: A Natural Experiment	HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH												Objective. To assess the impact of assignment to a Medicaid-focused versus mixed managed care plan on continuity of Medicaid coverage. Data Sources. 2011-2016 Medicaid claims from a Northeastern state. Study Design. Following the exit of a Medicaid managed care insurer, Medicaid administrators prioritized provider networks in reassigning enrollees, but randomly assigned beneficiaries whose providers were equally represented in the two plans. We leveraged the natural experiment created by random plan assignment and conducted an instrumental variable analysis. Data Collection. We analyzed Medicaid claims for 12,083 beneficiaries who were members of the exiting Blue Cross Blue Shield plan prior to January 1, 2011, Principal Findings. Managed care plan type did not significantly impact continuous enrollment in the Medicaid program. Greater outpatient utilization and the presence of a special need among children were associated with longer enrollment in Medicaid. Conclusions. Managed care plans did not differ in their capacity to keep Medicaid beneficiaries continuously enrolled in coverage, despite differences in plan features.

In the field of engineering education, Information and Communication Technologies are making continuous innovation in methods of teaching and learning for students. Engineering Education institutions, like the Technical University of Madrid (Spain), are expanding their online offerings and making a more effective use of technologies for learning. This research presents a gamification cooperative MOOC model (gcMOOC) that can be applied in the design of this type of course. Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, which integrates the quantitative and qualitative methods, the study investigates the factors that influence motivation, collaboration and learning in gcMOOC. This work also suggests a set of practical recommendations and tools to improve the motivation, learning level and completion rate of participants in MOOC course in Engineering Educational when the gcMOOC model is implemented. The results of this study state that the incorporation of virtual communities and gamification methodologies increase participant learning motivation in engineering MOOC courses. Additionally, these gamification tools aid students to deepen their learning and involve them in the course increasing their motivation and the completion rates in MOOCs.

In this study, a novel approach is proposed for utilizing an active ciliary system in microfluidic devices to separate particles based on their physical properties. In this approach, the bottom of the microchannel is covered with an equally spaced cilia array of various patterns which is actuated by an external stimuli. 3D simulations are carried out to study cilia-particle interaction and isolation dynamic in a microfluidic channel. It is observed that these elastic hair-like filaments can influence particle's trajectories differently depending on their biophysical properties. This modeling study utilizes immersed boundary method coupled with the lattice Boltzmann method. Soft particles and cilia are implemented through the spring connected network model and point-particle scheme, respectively. It is shown that cilia array with proper stimulation is able to continuously and non-destructively separate cells into subpopulations based on their size, shape, and stiffness. At the end, a design map for fabrication of a programmable microfluidic device capable of isolating various subpopulations of cells is developed. This biocompatible, label-free design can separate cells/soft microparticles with high throughput which can greatly complement existing separation technologies. Published by AIP Publishing.

To improve network communication efficiency, an event-triggered strategy is introduced. Under the premise of considering the design convenience of the sliding mode surface for discrete-time singular networked systems, the observer is constructed to estimate the states of the system. From the event-triggered strategy-based observer and the sliding mode control technology, the augmented closed-loop discrete-time singular networked system is obtained. Then, new sufficient admissible criteria of discrete-time singular networked systems are derived, satisfying a given H-infinity performance level. The synchronous design method of the event-triggered strategy observer gain and sliding mode control one is provided as solvable linear matrix inequalities. The sliding mode control law is designed to obtain better sliding mode accessibility and less chattering. Finally, two examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Virtual machine-based simulation platform for mobile ad-hoc network-based cyber infrastructure	JOURNAL OF DEFENSE MODELING AND SIMULATION-APPLICATIONS METHODOLOGY TECHNOLOGY-JDMS												In modeling and simulating complex systems, such as mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), in defense communications, it is a major challenge to reconcile multiple important considerations: the rapidity of unavoidable changes to the software (network layers and applications), the difficulty of modeling the critical, implementation-dependent behavioral effects, the need to sustain larger scale scenarios, and the desire for faster simulations. Here we present our approach in successfully reconciling them using a virtual time-synchronized virtual machine (VM)-based parallel execution framework that accurately lifts both the devices, as well as the network communications, to a virtual time plane while retaining full fidelity. At the core of our framework is a scheduling engine that operates at the level of a hypervisor scheduler, offering a unique ability to execute multi-core guest nodes over multi-core host nodes in an accurate, virtual time-synchronized manner. In contrast to other related approaches that suffer from either speed or accuracy issues, our framework provides MANET node-wise scalability, high fidelity of software behaviors, and time-ordering accuracy. The design and development of this framework is presented, and an actual implementation based on the widely used Xen hypervisor system is described. Benchmarks with synthetic and actual applications are used to identify the benefits of our approach. The time inaccuracy of traditional emulation methods is demonstrated, in comparison with the accurate execution of our framework verified by theoretically correct results expected from analytical models of the same scenarios. In the largest high-fidelity tests, we are able to perform virtual time-synchronized simulation of 64-node VM-based full-stack, actual software behaviors of MANETs containing a mix of static and mobile (unmanned airborne vehicle) nodes, hosted on a 32-core host, with full fidelity of unmodified ad-hoc routing protocols, unmodified application executables, and user-controllable physical layer effects, including inter-device wireless signal strength, reachability, and connectivity.

We model this problem as a discrete optimization problem over graphs, in which vertices represent the habitat areas and arcs represent the connections between them. We propose a new flow-based integer linear programming formulation that improves upon the existing models for this problem. By following an approach similar to Catanzaro et al. for the robust shortest path problem, we design an improved preprocessing algorithm that reduces the size of the graphs on which we compute generalized flows. Computational experiments show the benefits of both contributions, by enabling to solve instances of the problem larger than previous models. These experiments also show that several versions of greedy algorithms perform relatively well in practice, while returning arbitrarily bad solutions in the worst case.

J	Scarborough, C; Wu, ZN; Grbic, A				Scarborough, Cody; Wu, Zhanni; Grbic, Anthony			Efficient Computation of Spatially Discrete Traveling-Wave Modulated Structures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION												Traveling-wave modulation is a form of space-time modulation, which has been shown to enable unique electromagnetic phenomena such as nonreciprocity, beam steering, frequency conversion, and amplification. In practice, traveling-wave modulation is achieved by applying staggered time-modulation signals to a spatially discrete array of unit cells. Therefore, the capability to accurately simulate spatially discrete traveling-wave modulated structures is critical to the design. However, simulating these structures is challenging due to the complex space-time dependence of the constituent unit cells. In this article, a field relation (referred to as the interpath relation) is derived for spatially discrete traveling-wave modulated structures. The interpath relation reveals that the field within a single time-modulated unit cell (rather than an entire spatial period) is sufficient to determine the field solution throughout space. It will be shown that the interpath relation can be incorporated into the existing periodic method of moment solvers simply by modifying the source basis functions. As a result, the computational domain is reduced from an entire spatial period to a single time-modulated unit cell, dramatically reducing the number of unknowns. In the context of traveling-wave modulation, this enables researchers to efficiently simulate both complex structures with patterned unit cells in addition to continuous structures with infinitesimal unit cells.

This study uses data from an online discrete choice experiment with 1371 respondents to rigorously examine the factors shaping vaccine preference in the country. We find that vaccine efficacy, presence of side effects, protection duration, distance to vaccination centre and vaccination rates within social network play a critical role in determining vaccine demand. We apply a non-parametric model to uncover heterogeneity in the effects of these factors. We derive two novel insights from this analysis. First, even though, on average, domestically developed vaccines are preferred, around 30% of the sample favours foreign-developed vaccines. Second, vaccine preference of around 15% of the sample is highly sensitive to the presence of side effects and vaccination uptake among their peer group. These results provide insights for the ongoing policy debate around vaccine adoption in India. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This is accomplished by assuming that facilities with surplus capacity/production can cooperate with those facing shortage by transferring part of that capacity/production. Such a transfer incurs a cost that nonetheless may be compensated by savings both in the installation costs and in the distribution costs. Mixed-integer mathematical programming models are proposed for the problem. A distinction is made between the case in which the triangle inequality holds for the transfer costs and the case in which it does not. We present compact models, which are enhanced with valid inequalities that are separated in a branch-and-cut fashion. A comprehensive computational study with several hundreds of instances is reported showing the value of transferring capacities. Overall, this work investigates a problem that is at the core of more comprehensive models emerging in the context of logistics network design.

Specifically, on the one hand, we have applied a discrete control mechanism (i.e., impulsive control) into the system instead of a continuous one, which has the advantages of low control cost, high convergence speed; on the other hand, we considered the existence of impulse time windows when modeling the system, that is, a single impulse appears randomly within a time window rather than an ideal fixed position. In addition, this paper also considers the influence of stochastic disturbances caused by fluctuations in the external environment. Then, based on algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov stability theory, some sufficiency conditions that the system must meet to reach the consensus state are given.

Firstly, the competitive relationship between two groups is modeled as a multi-player game type. To achieve consensus, we design different cost functions according to the rules of the game and assume that each player has a global purpose of minimizing their own cost. Moreover, the players adjust their states at the next moment according to the Nash equilibrium solution. Then, using matrix theory and stability theory, we analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions for the consensus problem of the second-order HMASs with different leaders, and show that the control parameters (sampling interval and feedback gain) and the eigenvalues of the network topology have essential impact on the consensus of the system. Finally, the validity of the results is tested by simulation examples.

The power allocation objective is the maximization of the spectral efficiency of VR users while ensuring that FR users get the required rate. In contrast with the existing literature on power allocation, we exploit the sparsity of the virtual mm-wave channel matrix, obtained by applying fixed discrete-Fourier transform beamformers at both the transmitter and the receiver. Exploiting the channel partial orthogonality, users are first grouped based on the mutual interference and then the power is allocated among and within groups.

Dynamic Analysis of Fouling Buildup in Heat Exchangers Designed According to TEMA Standards	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												The prediction of important control properties is a challenging task for shell and tube heat exchangers design. Dynamic models, which include fouling effects, are still poorly investigated in the recent literature. To study the behavior of variable conditions over time and its influence on the dynamic aspects of the system, a design approach based on TEMA standards has been proposed, aiming to analyze the process in a more realistic equipment. To study the behavior of time-varying conditions and its influence in the system dynamics, the model considered in this work is based on the idea of heat exchanger cells as the basic modeling element. This kind of approach has some advantages over the distributed model, such as continuous variables in time and discrete in space, leading to ordinary differential equations (ODE) and also providing the possibility of controlling the model complexity by adjusting the number of modeling cells. The ratio between output and input signals in each cell generates eight operator transmittances that describe the dynamic of the system. The influence of fouling in the dynamic behavior is evaluated by considering its resistance (R-f) as a function of time. The model was implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and simulations have been carried out for different R-f values with a step change in three input variables. Open loop responses showed that as R-f increases, the quality of response is deteriorated and the system is affected mainly by the inertia and thermal exchange inefficiency.

The stochastic maintenance location routing allocation problem for rolling stock	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS												We study a problem where - given a railway network and different fleets - we have to locate maintenance locations and allocate the fleets to these locations. The allocation of fleets to the maintenance locations complicates the maintenance location routing problem. For each candidate location different facility sizes can be chosen and for each size there is an associated annual facility cost that captures the economies of scale in facility size. Because of the strategic nature of facility location, these facilities should be able to handle changes such as adjustments to the line plan and the introduction of new rolling stock types. We capture these changes by discrete scenarios and we formulate this two-stage stochastic problem as a mixed integer problem. Furthermore, we perform a case study with the Netherlands Railways that provides novel managerial insights by showing that the number of opened maintenance facilities highly depends on the allocation restrictions.

Some of these works use Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) to generate domain samples for deceiving phishing URL detectors. However, WGAN-based models are designed towork mainly on continuous data and cannot capture the diverse set of patterns in a URL sequence. In order to overcome this issue, we propose En-SeqGAN which works on discrete data to generate full URL sequences. The proposed model is based on the standard SeqGAN with the addition of entropy regularization to encourage the model to produce diverse URL samples. Several intensive experiments are done to prove that the URL samples generated by the proposed model can evade the gray-box phishing detectors of LSTM and Random Forest. The efficiency of gray-box attack by En-SeqGAN on these URL classifiers outperforms both methods of SeqGAN and WGAN. Moreover, En-SeqGAN can generate well-structured URL samples with various URL sequence lengths.

Based on the network topology, consensus protocol in discrete-time with dynamic step-size is designed. Conventional algorithms need man made step-size generally, having a great non-natural impact. The new algorithm employs a self-adaptive dynamic step-size based on the network topology, with little non-natural factor, and can reach a consensus faster. Firstly, for first-order discrete-time multi-agent system, designed the fast consensus protocols in discrete-time and provided a whole proof process through the method based on z-transformation. Then we proof this new algorithm can reach a consensus faster than the conventional algorithm through designing the simulation.																			2688-092X	2688-0938	978-1-4673-7189-6				2015							1007	1010																WOS:000380546900188

Stochasticity in different parameters along with time horizon can be a challenge in solving reverse logistics problems. This paper proposes a multi-stage, multi-period reverse logistics with lot sizing decisions under uncertainties. The main uncertain factors are return and demand quantities, and return quality. Moment matching method was adopted to generate a discrete set of scenarios to represent the original continuous distribution of stochastic parameters. Fast forward selection algorithm was employed to select the most representative scenarios and facilitate computational tractability. A case study was conducted and optimal solution of the recursive problem obtained by solving extensive form. Sensitivity analysis was implemented on different elements of stochastic solution. Results sow that solution of recursive problem (RP) outperforms the solution obtained from the problem with expected values of uncertain parameters (EEV).																				2071-1050				DEC	2021	13	24							13596	10.3390/su132413596	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132413596													WOS:000737309100001

Dynamic Real-time Multimodal Routing with Hierarchical Hybrid Planning	2019 30TH IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV19)	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium				30th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	JUN 09-12, 2019	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE, Intel, Intempora, Denso, Codeplay, Positics, Easy Mile, Natl Instruments, IAU, Toyota Res Inst				We introduce the problem of Dynamic Real-time Multimodal Routing (DREAMR), which requires planning and executing routes under uncertainty for an autonomous agent. The agent can use multiple modes of transportation in a dynamic transit vehicle network. For instance, a drone can either fly or ride on terrain vehicles for segments of their routes. DREAMR is a difficult problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty with both discrete and continuous variables. We design a novel hierarchical hybrid planning framework to solve the DREAMR problem that exploits its structural decomposability. Our framework consists of a global open-loop planning layer that invokes and monitors a local closed-loop execution layer. Additional abstractions allow efficient and seamless interleaving of planning and execution. We create a large-scale simulation for DREAMR problems, with each scenario having hundreds of transportation routes and thousands of connection points. Our algorithmic framework significantly outperforms a receding horizon control baseline, in terms of elapsed time to reach the destination and energy expended by the agent.

The hallmark of modern power systems is a highly integrated, flexible networked and communicative cyber-physical infrastructure having both continuous and discrete dynamics. Issues arising due to the complexity of these systems can be potentially solved by designing power control algorithms based on the information available at any instant of time. One of the developing technique is hybrid control which is mainly featured for a system under different operating conditions and in different operating states. This paper presents a unique approach for modeling and control of a smart grid considering its hybrid and complex nature. A model of smart grid has been developed with communication-assisted hybrid control strategy. The information on power flow management is updated to the operator through a feedback mechanism in order to meet desirable efficiency and reliability standards.

With the same "green agenda" in mind, we limit the extra complexity imposed on the relay node (RN) by invoking the AF, rather than the more complex decode-and-forward protocol. We theoretically characterize the proposed AF based SRAN in the context of the DS-CDMA uplink by evaluating its noncoherent Discrete-input Continuous-output Memoryless Channel (DCMC) capacity. We demonstrate that the cooperative DS-CDMA uplink achieves a higher capacity gain with respect to its conventional direct transmission based counterpart, when the system has to support a high number of DS-CDMA users.

In order to illustrate the method, a case-study structure is considered, composed of pendula equipped with hinge angular springs and connected one to each other by linear springs. The structure is mistuned due to mass and/or stiffness imperfections. Simple continuous models describing the dynamical behavior of the structure are derived and validated by comparison with a well-known discrete model. The proposed models provide analytical closed-form expressions for the eigenfrequencies and the eigenmodes, as well as for the resonance peaks of the forced response. These expressions highlight how the features of the dynamics of the mistuned structure, e.g. frequency split and localization phenomenon, depend on the physical parameters involved.

We analyze the structure of the reinforcement learning problems typically arising in quantum physics and argue that agents parameterized by long short-term memory (LSTM) networks trained via stochastic policy gradients yield a versatile method to solving them. In this context we introduce a variant of the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm called the memory proximal policy optimization (MPPO) which is based on the previous analysis. We argue that our method can by design be easily combined with numerical simulations as well as real experiments providing the reward signal. We demonstrate how the method can incorporate physical domain knowledge and present results of numerical experiments showing that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for several learning tasks in quantum control with discrete and continuous control parameters.

While manual snow surveys have traditionally been used to evaluate snow processes, their high costs and discrete measurements can lead to biased estimations of accumulation and ablation rates. Ultrasonic range sensors offer an alternative to continuously monitor snow depth but their widespread employment has been limited because of high prices. This paper describes the development of an inexpensive prototype ultrasonic sensor suite characterized by a ready-to-use stand-alone design and flexibility to incorporate additional meteorological instruments. The performance 01 48 units was tested during a winter season in central British Columbia, recording snow depth and air temperature data consistent with those from nearby weather stations and manual measurements. Despite a relatively small underestimation of snow depth due to known, repairable reasons, the sensor system demonstrated reliability for research and operations.

New direction in quality engineering: supply chain quality modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH												Applying quality engineering to the manufacturing supply chain is an area that has not been fully explored. This paper highlights the need for supply chain quality modelling tools to augment the vast array of quality tools used to predict and improve quality within a single corporate entity. The thesis of this paper is that network models are necessary to plan and improve quality in manufacturing supply chains. These models should augment, not replace, existing informational and organizational approaches to managing quality in the supply chain. Supply chain quality modelling is discussed in theoretical terms, and then two simple examples are given: a discrete example regarding a module required by an automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM); and a continuous example regarding production of a mechanical pencil lead. Future research topics in supply chain quality modelling are suggested as multi-company adaptations of design of experiments, tolerance analysis and allocation, performance analysis, and statistical process control.																			0020-7543	1366-588X					2007	45	23					5455	5464		10.1080/00207540701325140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207540701325140													WOS:000250704400002

However design of test data that meet the MC/DC criterion needs detailed manual analysis of branching in units under test by test engineers. To deal with this problem we propose a new test data generation approach based on reinforcement learning, which utilize analogy with a game, in which a gamer, the test engineer, plays in an environment, a unit under test, and tries to achieve the highest possible reward, MC/DC coverage. We evaluated our approach for two different granularity levels, test suite and test case, and for two different action types allowed to the gamer, discrete and continuous action spaces. Preliminary results shows that the proposed approach could solve path explosion problem of symbolic approaches and that the proposed approach achieves at least comparable results to the current state-of-the-art searchbased test data generation approaches.

Unlike prior methods that express those BRDFs as discrete high-dimensional matrices or tensors, our technique considers measured BRDFs as continuous functions and works in cor-responding function spaces. Specifically, provided the evaluations of a set of BRDFs, such as ones in MERL and EPFL datasets, our method learns a low-dimensional latent space as well as a few neural networks to encode and decode these measured BRDFs or new BRDFs into and from this space in a non-linear fashion. Leveraging this latent space and the flexibility offered by the NPs formulation, our encoded BRDFs are highly compact and offer a level of accuracy better than prior methods. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach via two important applications, BRDF compression and editing. Additionally, we design two alternative post-trained decoders to, respectively, achieve better compression ratio for individual BRDFs and enable importance sampling of BRDFs.																			0730-0301	1557-7368				APR	2022	41	2							14	10.1145/3490335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3490335													WOS:000765084500004

Specifically, an ITC module is developed to achieve better control of exploration/exploitation searches by linearly increasing the particle's topology connectivity with time as well as performing the shuffling mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a new learning framework that consists of a new velocity update mechanism and a new neighborhood search operator that aims to enhance the algorithm's searching performance. The proposed PSO-ITC is extensively evaluated across 20 benchmark functions with various features as well as two engineering design problems. Simulation results reveal that the performance of the PSO-ITC is superior to nine other PSO variants and six cutting-edge metaheuristic search algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Deshpande, VM; Bhattacharya, R				Deshpande, Vedang M.; Bhattacharya, Raktim			Guaranteed Robust Performance of <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> Filters With Sparse and Low Precision Sensing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												The performance of estimation algorithms depends on the available sensors and their precisions. While higher precisions of sensors provide better estimation accuracy, it may lead to unnecessarily expensive designs and higher operational costs due to the higher costs of high-precision sensing modalities. Also, higher precision can cause interference for other sensors in the environment, such as RADARs, resulting in degradation in the overall system's performance. This article presents a framework for codesigning a sparse sensing network with the least precise sensors and the filter that guarantees the prescribed H-infinity estimation accuracy. Convex optimization problems for minimizing sensor precisions are formulated for continuous and discrete-time linear time-invariant systems, with and without model uncertainties. Different heuristics for determining a sparse sensor set with the least precise sensors are discussed, and their performances are compared using numerical simulations. The application of the proposed framework is demonstrated using numerical examples.																			0018-9286	1558-2523				FEB	2024	69	2					1029	1036		10.1109/TAC.2023.3276824	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2023.3276824													WOS:001177377500061

IMFWA maps continuous space to discrete space by designing the fireworks location coding method, improves the Gaussian mutation process, and sets adaptive dimensions to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. At the same time, in order to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm and shorten the time finding the optimal task scheduling sequence, the fitness-based tournament selection strategy is used instead of the rule based on Euclidean distance. Finally, IMFWA is compared with the basic fireworks algorithm and the genetic algorithms on the Matlab platform for performance analysis.

For continuous-time systems, a novel consensus algorithm is proposed. Based on a system transformation method, the consensus problem for heterogeneous multi-agent systems is converted into a consensus problem for homogeneous multi-agent systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee that the designed consensus algorithm asymptotically solves the consensus for heterogeneous multi-agent systems under a fixed topology. The final convergence states are shown explicitly for this case. Sufficient conditions are given to guarantee that heterogeneous multi-agent systems reach consensus asymptotically under switching topologies. The obtained results are superior obviously to the existing ones in the literature. The counterparts about discrete-time systems are also investigated.

The notion of stability of continuous-time and discrete-time systems is briefly introduced and applied to a simple closed-loop inertial system. It is then demonstrated how the stability of dynamic systems depends on a sampling period as well as on gain. Subsequently, the analysis is applied to a model of an electronically controlled pressure-reducing valve (PRV) coupled with a transient model of a water distribution network (WDN). The occurrence of instabilities at overly long sampling periods is demonstrated. Practical recommendations on the appropriate choice of sampling times are put forth based on simulation results and control engineering rules of thumb given the closed-loop system's dynamics. Performance of a theoretical pressure control scheme is then simulated under time-varying demands and with controllers designed to work at different sampling frequencies.

A Novel Method to Produce Harmonic Structured Ti with Excellent Compressive Properties	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF METALS												The present study deals with the development of a harmonic structured commercially pure Ti using a novel and newly designed press-milling method to surface-deform the Ti powder particles and subsequent sintering. The harmonic structure is a bimodal distribution of fine and coarse grains where a continuous network of fine grains (shell) surrounds discrete clusters of coarse grains (core). A harmonic structured Ti featuring a shell with an average grain size of similar to 4.3 mu m and a core with an average grain size of similar to 12 mu m is obtained. The HCP crystal structure in the XRD patterns indicates the absence of any phase transformation due to press-milling. The hardness of the shell region improves similar to 2.5 times that of core regions.

To avoid projection operations due to constraints in the scenario with large-scale variable dimensions, we propose distributed projection-free dynamics by employing the Frank-Wolfe method, also known as the conditional gradient. Technically, we find a feasible descent direction by solving an alternative linear suboptimization. To make the approach available over multiagent networks with weight-balanced digraphs, we design dynamics to simultaneously achieve both the consensus of local decision variables and the global gradient tracking of auxiliary variables. Then, we present the rigorous convergence analysis of the continuous-time dynamical systems. Also, we derive its discrete-time scheme with an accordingly proved convergence rate of $O(1/k)$ . Furthermore, to clarify the advantage of our proposed distributed projection-free dynamics, we make detailed discussions and comparisons with both existing distributed projection-based dynamics and other distributed Frank-Wolfe algorithms.

The quantizer used here is a uniform one with arbitrary quantization regions, and the packet dropout process is modeled as a time-homogenous Markov process. Because of the properties of packet dropout process, the fuzzy systems considered here are seen as Markov jump fuzzy systems, and the theories of Markov jump system are used to discuss the mean square stability of the closed-loop systems. On the basis of the zoom strategy and Lyapunov theory, for the given failure rate and recovery rate, sufficient conditions are given for the closed-loop fuzzy systems to be mean square stable, and the feedback controllers are designed to ensure the stability of fuzzy systems. A single link direct joint driven manipulator model is presented to show the effectiveness of the main results. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Zhang, L; Zhang, L				Zhang, Li; Zhang, Lei			Distributed Traffic Signal Optimization at V2X Intersections	MATHEMATICS												This paper presents our research on a traffic signal control system (TSCS) at V2X intersections. The overall objective of the study is to create an implementable TSCS. The specific objective of this paper is to investigate a distributed system towards implementation. The objective function of minimizing queue delay is formulated as the integral of queue lengths. The discrete queueing estimation is mixed with macro and micro traffic flow models. The novel proposed architecture alleviates the communication network bandwidth constraint by processing BSMs and computing queue lengths at the local intersection. In addition, a two-stage distributed system is designed to optimize offsets, splits, and cycle length simultaneously and in real time. The paper advances TSCS theories by contributing a novel analytic formulation of delay functions and their first degree of derivatives for a two-stage optimization model. The open-source traffic simulation engine Enhanced Transportation Flow Open-Source Microscopic Model (ETFOMM version 1.2) was selected as a simulation environment to develop, debug, and evaluate the models and the system. The control delay of the major direction, minor direction, and the total network were collected to assess the system performance. Compared with the optimized TSCS timing plan by the Virginia Department of Transportation, the system generated a 21% control delay reduction in the major direction and a 7% control delay reduction in the minor direction at just a 10% penetration rate of connected vehicles. Finally, the proposed distributed and centralized systems present similar performances in the case study.

J	Norton, M; Mafusalov, A; Uryasev, S				Norton, Matthew; Mafusalov, Alexander; Uryasev, Stan			CARDINALITY OF UPPER AVERAGE AND ITS APPLICATION TO NETWORK OPTIMIZATION	SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION												We propose a new characteristic for counting the number of large outcomes in a data set that are considered to be large with respect to some fixed threshold x. A popular characteristic used for this purpose is the Cardinality of Upper Tail (CUT), which counts the number of outcomes with magnitude larger than the threshold. We propose a similar characteristic called the Cardinality of Upper Average (CUA), defined as the number of largest data points which have average value equal to the threshold. CUA not only assesses the number of outcomes that are large, but also their overall magnitude. CUA also has superior mathematical properties: it is a continuous function of the threshold, its reciprocal is piecewise linear with respect to threshold, and it is directly optimizable via convex and linear programming. This is in contrast to CUT, which does not asses the severity of large outcomes, is discontinuous as a function of threshold, and is such that direct optimization yields numerically difficult nonconvex problems. We show that CUA can be used to formulate meaningful optimization problems containing counters of the largest components of a vector without introduction of binary variables, leading to large improvement in computation speeds. In particular, we apply the CUA concept to create new formulations of network optimization problems involving overloaded nodes or edges, where we aim to minimize the number of most burdened nodes or edges.

J	Ameri, M; Besharati, Z				Ameri, Mohammad; Besharati, Zahed			Optimal design and operation of district heating and cooling networks with CCHP systems in a residential complex	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS												The aim of the paper is to describe a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for determining the optimal capacity and operation of seven combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) systems in the heating and cooling network of a residential district (Shahid Beheshti Town) located in east of Tehran. In this model, by minimizing the initial and operating costs of energy supply system, capacity of various components, and optimal operation strategy are determined using continuous variables, and binary decision variables describe the existence/absence of each considered component and its on/off operation status. A distributed energy supply system is made up of district heating and cooling networks, gas turbines as the prime mover for CHP systems, photovoltaic systems (PV) and conventional equipments also, such as boilers and absorption and compression chillers. In this configuration, the required heat is obtained from natural gas consumption by cogeneration system and auxiliary boilers. Four different scenarios were defined to assess the impact of the use of photovoltaic and CCHP systems in the energy supply system in the residential complex. The economic and environmental results obtained from the scenarios revealed saving in costs and reduction in CO2 emissions in the optimal cogeneration system compared with using boilers to produce heat and of buying electricity from the grid.

In this paper, a time-modulated active frequency selective surface (AFSS) absorber/reflector is proposed to manipulate the spectral distribution of the echo signal. The discrete harmonics based on the period modulation and the continuous spectrum based on the random coding modulation are analyzed in detail. In addition, a simple digital-coding control network based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) in the time-modulated AFSS absorber/reflector (TMAAR) is used to switch between absorbing and reflecting states flexibly. By coding "0" and "1" elements with the controlled sequences, the TMAAR is able to achieve the predefined modulation function for spectrum conversion. On this basis, a prototype of the designed TMAAR is manufactured. The linear frequency modulation radar echo experiments are performed to verify the required function of spectrum conversion.

Nevertheless, the promise of excellent functional composites with low content of LMPA has been greatly weakened as poor compatibility between LMPA and polymer. To address this problem, introducing metal interface layer to polymer microsphere' surface is promising method by inspiration of depositing silver coating on copper-clad laminates. Here, silver interface layer was introduced to the surface of polyvinylidene fluoride microspheres through the polydopamine (PVDF@PDA@Ag). After mixing PVDF@PDA@Ag microspheres with Sn-58Bi (LMPA), PVDF@PDA@Ag/LMPA composite with segregated structure was successfully fabricated by hot-pressing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) test revealed that intermetallic compounds of Ag3Sn was production. Owing to Ag3Sn promoting LMPA coated on surface of microsphere, the microscopic conduction path of composites transforming from irregular continuous LMPA network to segregated network. In the case of low LMPA content (10 vol%), PVDF@PDA@Ag/LMPA composite owned thermal conductivity of 1.79 W/mK, while PVDF/LMPA composite was only 0.36 W/mK. Compared to PVDF/LMPA composite, the enhancement factor of PVDF@PDA@Ag/LMPA composite was improved from 56.52% to 678.26%. This article offered viable route to enhance compatibility between polymer and LMPA.						zhang, xian/0000-0002-7910-1562													1022-9760	1572-8935				SEP	2022	29	9							390	10.1007/s10965-022-03242-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10965-022-03242-9													WOS:000841798100001

Scheduled nodes rely solely on a centralized scheduler within the base station for the assignment of resources, while uncoordinated nodes use an unslotted Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) protocol for channel access. We propose and evaluate through simulations: (a) a novel centralized resource scheduling algorithm, called Neighbors-Aware Proportional Fair (N-PF) and (b) a novel packet length adaptation algorithm, called Channel-Aware (CA) Packet Length Adaptation algorithm for the scheduled nodes. The N-PF algorithm considers the uplink channel state conditions and the number of uncoordinated nodes neighboring each scheduled node in the aggregate scheduling metric, in order to maximize packet transmission success probability. The CA algorithm provides an additional degree of freedom for improving the performance, thanks to the fact that scheduled nodes with lower number of hidden terminals, i.e., having higher packet capture probability, are assigned longer packet transmission opportunities. We consider two benchmark schemes: Proportional Fair (PF) algorithm, as a resource scheduling algorithm, and a discrete uniform distribution (DUD) scheme for packet lengths distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can result in significant gain in terms of network goodput, without compromising fairness, with respect to two benchmark solutions taken from the literature.																			1687-1472	1687-1499				MAY 22	2017									93	10.1186/s13638-017-0875-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13638-017-0875-6													WOS:000402186500002

In the considered model, UAVs provide terrestrial users with wireless services and illumination simultaneously. Moreover, RISs are utilized to further improve the channel quality between UAVs and users. This joint placement and resource management problem is constructed aiming at acquiring the optimal UAV deployment, RISs phase shift, user and RIS association that satisfies the users' needs with minimum consumption of the UAVs' energy. An iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes continuous and binary variables is proposed to solve this mixed-integer programming problem. Specifically, RISs phase shift optimization is solved by phases alignment method and semidefinite program algorithm. Next, the successive convex approximation algorithm is proposed to settle the UAV deployment problem. The user and RIS association variables are relaxed to the continuous ones before adopting the dual method to find the optimal solution. Moreover, a greedy algorithm is proposed as an alternative to RIS association optimization with low complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed two schemes harvest the superior performance of 34.85% and 32.11% energy consumption reduction over the case without RIS, respectively.

The problem involves synthesizing a network of property-modifying units and scheduling operating schemes. Data and constraints for the process sources, sinks, and interceptors are given in terms of properties. Sources are process streams to be allocated. Sinks are process units that can accept the sources. Interceptors are new units to be added to the process to intercept the sources and adjust their properties to meet the sink requirements. The interceptors may be steady-state or dynamic units whose performance is expressed in terms of input-output relations for designated properties. In addition to flowrate bounds, the constraints on acceptable feeds to the sinks are described as lower and upper bounds on designated proper-ties. A conceptual framework is first developed to serve as the basis for a mathematical program coordinating the synthesis of the interception and allocation networks as well as the operational scheduling of the system. A source-interception-sink representation is developed to embed structural configurations of interest. The time domain is decomposed into repeating episodes. Within each episode, the interceptors are allowed to modify properties of sources, remain idle, or undergo regeneration. The regeneration process restores the interceptor to its initial condition. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming formulation is developed to minimize the total annualized cost of the system, synthesize the network, and determine its optimal operating schedule. A case study is solved to demonstrate the new problem and the devised solution algorithm. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Farmers? socio-economic trade-offs when adopting agro-ecological practices	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Despite substantial policy efforts made by the French government to reduce dependence on pesticides, farming practices are only changing slowly. This paper analyses the socio-economic trade-offs that 110 farmers are currently facing in the transition to agro-ecological practices. A mixed-method approach - a quantitative discrete choice experiment (DCE) and qualitative interviews - was set up to understand these farmers' motivations and perspectives, and how policy can improve to accompany them on the road to low chemical input farming. Results of the DCE indicate that the majority of the farmers in our sample are keen to change practices but are at a loss as to how this can be done, as a number of preferences for this transition came out as inconclusive. Qualitative interviews with a representative sample of the farmers that took part in the DCE complemented this result by illustrating a deep uncertainty for the future and a disconnect felt between authorities and themselves as a group. We argue that this uncertainty contributed to a lack of clear-cut solutions established through the DCE. The indepth discussions with farmers illustrated the wish for concrete and local policy measures based on farmers' networks and peer support.

While the protein interaction model between cells is biologically fairly well understood, the interaction resulting in spatial distribution of proteins within each cell is not. We propose a weak interaction mechanism between proteins within each cell, and we incorporate this with a model of the protein interaction between cells to form a hybrid model, in which the continuous growth and decay of proteins is modeled using continuous state linear differential equations, and the discrete switches which activate and deactivate proteins axe modeled using finite state machines. We then present a preliminary model validation: equilibrium analysis of the hybrid model provides allowable parameter ranges for growth and decay rates, as well as conditions on the cell network boundary conditions, for the biologically feasible steady state protein concentrations to occur. We conclude with a comparison of our analytical results against experimental image data obtained in collaboration with the Stanford University School of Medicine: we present the design of our image analysis algorithm and results for time stamped images of protein localization within the Drosophila wing.																			0191-2216		0-7803-7516-5				2002							1588	1594																WOS:000181352300285
J	Park, M; Nassar, M; Vikalo, H				Park, Mijung; Nassar, Marcel; Vikalo, Haris			Bayesian Active Learning for Drug Combinations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING												The dynamics of complex diseases are governed by intricate interactions of myriad factors. Drug combinations, formed by mixing several single-drug treatments at various doses, can enhance the effectiveness of the therapy by targeting multiple contributing factors. The main challenge in designing drug combinations is the highly nonlinear interaction of the constituent drugs. Prior work focused on guided space-exploratory heuristics that require discretization of drug doses. While being more efficient than random sampling, these methods are impractical if the drug space is high dimensional or if the drug sensitivity is unknown. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the obtained combinations may decrease if the resolution of the discretization grid is not sufficiently fine. In this paper, we model the biological system response to a continuous combination of drug doses by a Gaussian process (GP). We perform closed-loop experiments that rely on the expected improvement criterion to efficiently guide the exploration process toward drug combinations with the optimal response. When computing the criterion, we marginalize out the GP hyperparameters in a fully Bayesian manner using a particle filter. Finally, we employ a hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm to rapidly explore the high-dimensional continuous search space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a fully factorial Drosophila dataset, an antiviral drug dataset for Herpes simplex virus type 1, and simulated human Apoptosis networks. The results show that our approach significantly reduces the number of required trials compared to existing methods.																			0018-9294	1558-2531				NOV	2013	60	11					3248	3255		10.1109/TBME.2013.2272322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2272322								23846437					WOS:000325974500028
J	Radac, MB; Precup, RE				Radac, Mircea-Bogdan; Precup, Radu-Emil			Data-driven MIMO model-free reference tracking control with nonlinear state-feedback and fractional order controllers	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												In this paper we suggest an extension of the Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) framework to nonlinear state-feedback and fractional order (FO) controllers. Theoretical analysis incentivizes the use of VRFT for tuning general nonlinear controllers to achieve model reference matching because it is expected that the more complex controller parameterization of the nonlinear-state-feedback and FO controllers leads to improved control performance. Key factors needed for successful controller tuning are discussed: good exploration of process dynamics depending on careful input excitation signal selection, the influence of the controller parameterization and the selection of the reference model. VRFT is next applied to a Multi Input-Multi Output (MIMO) nonlinear coupled vertical tank system as a case study, to tune MIMO proportional-integral (PI), fractional order-proportional-integral (FO-PI) and neural network state-feedback controllers. PI and FO-PI controllers are tuned in continuous time but implemented in discrete time to enable their real-world applications. Controllers' complexity vs. control performance trade-off is revealed. For comparisons purposes, an original combination of VRFT and Batch Fitted Q-Learning is employed as a two-step model-free controller tuning procedure for dramatic performance improvement.

However, Li2FeSiO4 possesses a poor conductivity, and co-exists with a small amount of an insulating glassy SiO2 impurity, leading to severe capacity decay at high rates. Herein, we report a mesoporous Li2FeSiO4/Fe7SiO10 hetero-nanocrystal/C nanocomposite as a cathode material for high power lithium-ion batteries. By controlling the crystallization and composition of the materials, a smaller amount of mixed valence Fe7SiO10 nanocrystals intergrow with Li2FeSiO4 nanocrystals instead of glassy SiO2, thus minimizing the insulating SiO2 in the Li2FeSiO2 cathode. The conductive hybrid framework consisting of a three-dimensional carbon network and conductive Fe7SiO10 nanocrystals offers a continuous electron transport network in the material, and sponge-like mesoporosity allows efficient penetration, transport and storage of an electrolyte within a cathode. By intergrowing Li2FeSiO4/Fe7SiO10 hetero-nanocrystals, a remarkably improved high-rate performance is achieved with a reversible discharge capacity of 112 mA h g(-1)over 80 cycles at a current rate of 10 C. Our finding represents a new approach towards designing conductive nanostructures of insulating oxides for high-power lithium-ion batteries on a mesoscopic scale.

Instead of one common event-triggering scheme, multiple triggering schemes are introduced to sample system signals and the event-triggered Markov closed-loop jump systems are further obtained under the full state feedback controller. Generally, mode information of subsystems is not completely available for the modules of trigger and controller such that asynchronous jump behaviour may occur among the modes of subsystems, triggering scheme and controller. Thus, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is developed to describe such asynchronous behaviour. Meanwhile, security issues of networks are widely studied in recent many literature. For discrete-time Markov jump systems, few works consider cyber attacks, especially periodic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Based on the HMM, the DoS attacks are taken into account and a set of sufficient conditions are further presented to guarantee the L-2-L-infinity control performance of the resulting Markov closed-loop jump systems. Subsequently, the design of controller and event-triggering parameters are provided by using matrix inequality method. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.																			0020-7721	1464-5319				JAN 2	2024	55	1					16	32		10.1080/00207721.2023.2268243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2023.2268243		OCT 2023											WOS:001089631800001

Inspired by classical EDAs, PMBGNP memorizes the current best individuals and uses them to estimate a distribution for the generation of the new population. However, PMBGNP can evolve compact programs by representing its solutions as graph structures. Therefore, it can solve a range of problems different from conventional ones in EDA literature, such as data mining and Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. This paper extends PMBGNP from discrete to continuous search space, which is named PMBGNP-AC. Besides evolving the node connections to determine the optimal graph structures using conventional PMBGNP, Gaussian distribution is used for the distribution of continuous variables of nodes. The mean value mu and standard deviation sigma are constructed like those of classical continuous Population-based incremental learning (PBILc). However, a RL technique, i.e., Actor-Critic (AC), is designed to update the parameters (mu and sigma). AC allows us to calculate the Temporal-Difference (TD) error to evaluate whether the selection of the continuous value is better or worse than expected. This scalar reinforcement signal can decide whether the tendency to select this continuous value should be strengthened or weakened, allowing us to determine the shape of the probability density functions of the Gaussian distribution. The proposed algorithm is applied to a RL problem, i.e., autonomous robot control, where the robot's wheel speeds and sensor values are continuous. The experimental results show the superiority of PMBGNP-AC comparing with the conventional algorithms.

J	Wu, JH; Li, XG; Wang, Y				Wu, Jihuan; Li, Xuguang; Wang, Yu			Insight into the Effect of Natural Fracture Density in a Shale Reservoir on Hydraulic Fracture Propagation: Physical Model Testing	ENERGIES												Here, laboratory tests were conducted to examine the effects of natural fracture density (NFD) on the propagation of hydraulic fracture (HF), HF and natural fracture (NF) interaction, and the formation of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). Laboratory methods were proposed to prepare samples with dense, medium and spare discrete orthogonal fracture networks. After conducting a true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experiment on the synthetic blocks, the experimental results were analyzed by qualitative failure morphology descriptions, and the quantitative analysis used two proposed new indices. On the pump pressure profiles, it reflected the non-linear interactions between HFs and NFs well. For rock blocks with a dense DFN density, pump pressure curves present fluctuation shape and the degree of interaction between HF and NF is strong; however, for model blocks with a sparse DFN density, the pump pressure curves present a sudden drop shape. In addition, different propagation behaviors of NFs-offset, divert, branch, and cross NF-can be observed from the fractured model blocks. By using a proposed index of "P-SRV", the relationship between NFD and the fracturing effectiveness was further confirmed. Furthermore, the most striking finding is that mixed mode I-II and I-III fracture types can be formed in the naturally fractured model blocks. The experimental results are beneficial for grasping the influential mechanism of NFD on the propagation of HF and for developing more accurate and full 3D-coupled simulation models for unconventional oil and gas development.						wang, yu/0000-0003-2693-7056														1996-1073				JAN	2023	16	2							612	10.3390/en16020612	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16020612													WOS:000915561900001

More specifically, a predictive-flow-queue (PFQ)-based packet interface architecture is presented, which adjusts the operating frequency of different functional blocks at a fine granularity so as to minimize the total system energy dissipation while attaining performance goals. A key feature of the proposed architecture is the implementation of a runtime workload prediction method for the network traffic along with a continuous frequency adjustment mechanism, which enables one to eliminate the latency and energy penalties associated with discrete power mode transitions. Furthermore, a stochastic modeling framework based on Markovian decision processes and queuing models is employed, which make it possible to adopt a precise mathematical programming formulation for the energy optimization under performance constraints. Experimental results with a designed 65-nm Gb Ethernet controller show that the proposed interface architecture and continuous frequency scaling result in system-wide energy savings while meeting performance specifications.

Massive hydraulic fracturing is an important technology for the economic development of shale formations in which a large-scale hydraulic fracture network (HFN) is generated for hydrocarbon flow. In this study, HFN propagation is numerically investigated in a horizontally layered and naturally fractured shale formation by using a newly developed complex fracturing model based on the 3D discrete element method. In this model, a succession of continuous horizontal BP interfaces and vertical NFs is explicitly represented and a shale matrix block is considered impermeable, transversely isotropic, and linearly elastic. A series of simulations is performed to illustrate the influence of anisotropy, associated with the presence of BPs, on the HFN propagation geometry in shale formations. Modeling results reveal that the presence of BP interfaces increases the injection pressure during fracturing. HF deflection into a BP interface tends to occur under high strength and elastic anisotropy as well as in low vertical stress anisotropy conditions, which generate a T-shaped or horizontal fracture. Opened BP interfaces may limit the growth of the fracture upward and downward, resulting in a very low stimulated thickness. However, the opened BP interfaces favor fracture complexity because of the improved connection between HFs and NFs horizontally under moderate vertical stress anisotropy. This study may help predict the HF growth geometry and optimize the fracturing treatment designs in shale formations with complex depositional heterogeneity.																			0723-2632	1434-453X				SEP	2016	49	9					3597	3614		10.1007/s00603-016-1001-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00603-016-1001-5													WOS:000382673200013

This study presents an effective co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization-based selective neural network ensembles (E-CPSOSEN) enabled tool wear prediction model for flank wear prediction in drilling operations. The E-CPSOSEN algorithm utilized two populations of particle swarm optimizations (PSOs) that are co-evolved simultaneously, one discrete particle swarm optimizations for evolving the binary selection vector, and the other continuous particle swarm optimizations for evolving the real weight vector. The two PSOs interact with each other through the fitness evaluation. The E-CPSOSEN algorithm is first tested on four benchmark problems taken from the literature. Upon achieving good results for test cases, the E-CPSOSEN enabled tool wear prediction model was employed to three illustrative case studies of flank wear prediction in drilling operations. Significant improvement is also obtained in comparison to the results already reported in literatures, which further reveals that the E-CPSOSEN enabled tool wear prediction model has more wonderful prediction performance than conventional single ANN-based models in predicting the flank wear in drilling operations. Moreover, an investigation was also conducted to identity the effects of the major parameters of the E-CPSOSEN algorithm upon its prediction performance. From the given results, the proposed enabled tool wear prediction model may be a promising tool for the accurate and automatic prediction of flank wear in drilling operations.																			0956-5515	1572-8145				APR	2016	27	2					343	361		10.1007/s10845-013-0867-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10845-013-0867-2													WOS:000372173800006

At present, mainstream approaches post-process the feature map extracted by the convolutional neural network backbone to obtain a global representation or a fine-grained local representation for higher accuracy. However, they still suffer from challenges, such as information loss for global-based methods and spatio-temporal feature fragmentation for local-based methods. To alleviate these problems, this article proposes a Spatio-Temporal Feature Enhancement (STFE) network from a spatio-temporal comprehensive perspective, combining the advantages of the above methods to obtain more comprehensive information from video tracklets. STFE consists of two main modules: Feature Space Projection Module (FSPM) and Global Low-frequency Enhancement Module (GLEM). FSPM mathematically converts continuous video information into a discrete feature space and selectively retains more useful information, thus avoiding spatio-temporal information loss. Meanwhile, FSPM applies global features instead of dividing feature maps spatially, thereby avoiding spatio-temporal feature fragmentation. In addition, GLEM which is based on transformer, acts as a broadband low-pass filter to mine richer global comprehensive information. Finally, by combining FSPM with GLEM, STFE can obtain spatio-temporal comprehensive video representation. Extensive experiments were conducted on two widely-used video Re-ID datasets. The experimental results verify our idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed STFE with 95.5% Rank-1 accuracy on MARS benchmarks, which surpasses previous state-of-the-arts by a large margin of +4%.

However, existing NAS algorithms are primarily designed to solve the image classification task, and person re-ID, as a sub-problem of image retrieval, differs significantly from classification. To address this issue, we propose a neural architecture search method that leverages dual space to tackle the problem of person re-identification. The neural network discovered through this approach is named DSSNet. In our approach, the dual-space framework comprises two distinct subspaces, each housing a specialized re-ID module dedicated to extracting crucial pedestrian information. By integrating the knowledge of person re-identification into the neural architecture search process, DSSNet achieves superior performance and robustness in re-ID tasks. Moreover, traditional gradient-based NAS methods associate the intensity of operations with continuous architecture parameters during the search process, leading to network degradation. To enhance the accuracy of the search, we propose a novel architecture selection method based on discretization accuracy. The method optimizes the selection of architectures by considering their performance at a discrete precision level. In addition, we introduce a retrieval loss to guide the architecture in learning the similarity or dissimilarity between two pedestrian objects. Our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the search process without the need for human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our final architecture outperforms state-of-the-art re-ID models on three benchmark datasets, showcasing its superior performance in the re-ID task.																			0178-2789	1432-2315				2024 MAR 28	2024										10.1007/s00371-024-03308-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00371-024-03308-3		MAR 2024											WOS:001194634300003

Krishna; Fukuda, Atsushi			Detection of Collision-Prone Vehicle Behavior a Intersections Using Siamese Interaction LSTM	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS												As a large proportion of road accidents occur at intersections, monitoring traffic safety of intersections is important. Existing approaches are designed to investigate accidents in lane-based traffic. However, such approaches are not suitable in a lane-less mixed-traffic environment where vehicles often ply very close to each other. Hence, we propose an approach called Siamese Interaction Long Short-Term Memory network (SILSTM) to detect collision prone vehicle behavior. The SILSTM network learns the interaction trajectory of a vehicle that describes the interactions of a vehicle with its neighbors at an intersection. Among the hundreds of interactions for every vehicle, there maybe only some interactions that may be unsafe, and hence, a temporal attention layer is used in the SILSTM network. Furthermore, the comparison of interaction trajectories requires labeling the trajectories as either unsafe or safe, but such a distinction is highly subjective, especially in lane-less traffic. Hence, in this work, we compute the characteristics of interaction trajectories involved in accidents using the collision energy model. The interaction trajectories that match accident characteristics are labeled as unsafe while the rest are considered safe. Finally, there is no existing dataset that allows us to monitor a particular intersection for a long duration. Therefore, we introduce the SkyEye dataset that contains I hour of continuous aerial footage from each of the 4 chosen intersections in the city of Ahmedabad in India. A detailed evaluation of SILSTM on the SkyEye dataset shows that unsafe (collision-prone) interaction trajectories can be effectively detected at different intersections.

A Data-Driven Bayesian Network (DDBN) with random variables representing scene elements, accident causes, and accident consequences as nodes, and conditional dependencies between nodes as edges is proposed to identify the most significant accident causes in various and complex specific accident scenes. First, an unsupervised-supervised method is designed to define the states of nodes in the DDBN, considering the characteristics of the data involving both continuous and discrete states. Second, a greedy algorithm is proposed to mine the causal sequence between nodes, and the direction of edges in DDBN is established accordingly. Then, an NB-K2-MLE approach is proposed to generate the structure and parameters of the DDBN from data. Finally, a risk calculation function based on DDBN is proposed to calculate the risk of various accident causes in specific scenes. In empirical analysis based on real accident data, the inference accuracy of DDBN reached 87.92 %, with precision and recall exceeding 70 %. More importantly, the research results indicate that the distribution of accident causes will concentrate with the refinement and specific of the scene, and the main accident causes at the macro level cannot be fully applicable to accident prevention in specific scenes. The DDBN constructed in this study can provide data support for the determination of the significant accident causes and the development of targeted accident prevention strategies in various and complex specific scenes.

It reveals that examining the three problems of location, inventory and pricing in an integrated and simultaneous manner can be the best approach to optimize the supply chain (SC) and increase the profitability of its companies. The investigated three-level SC distribution network model includes one supplier, several distribution centers (DCs), and several customers. The model is structured in form of a mixed integer nonlinear programming to maximize the long-term average profit of the distribution network. It considers constraints of inventory capacity along with continuous review inventory policy in each open DC. For its DCs' retail price determination, two competing pricing approaches of higher than and lower than the average price of competitors have been used. The approach has been investigated on several potential DCs and customers and its numerical results show that retail price from the DCs to the customers is dependent on the average price of the market and its fluctuations. The major finding of this research is the fact that the type of demand function can have a substantial effect on the obtained results in the location-inventory-pricing model and greatly influence the amount of the profit of each company. Its applied strategy along with innovative competition-based pricing approach and projection of customers' demand via linear and exponential functions show how companies can increase their profit through price adjustment and demand projection.																			0399-0559	2804-7303				MAY 15	2024	58	3					2075	2106		10.1051/ro/2024057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/ro/2024057													WOS:001223069100001

In order to fulfill customers' needs, they have to be designed and organized in the proper way. The dynamic analysis of their behavior through simulation provides important information to improve their performances. Most existing research works addressing the modeling and simulation of supply chains are generally based on a discrete event worldview. We are concerned here with medium or long term decision problems, which necessitate "macroscopic" models of the supply chain. At these levels, the representation of the individual flows of the numerous parts that circulates in the supply chain being quite difficult, given the objectives considered, we chose a continuous worldview. The models are based on Forrester's system dynamic paradigms. The proposed approach is actually applied to a large French company, in the automotive industry. The supply chain presented in this article is composed of five existing plants, located in two different production areas. The results show the concrete benefits that can be achieved. Several research directions are suggested. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed circuits implement discrete-time continuous-state dynamics by means of analog processing in a time domain, and also approximately implement continuous-time dynamics. Arbitrary nonlinear transformation functions are generated by the process in which a PPM signal samples a voltage or current source whose waveform in the time domain has the same shape as the desired transformation function. Because a shared arbitrary nonlinear voltage or current waveform generator can be constructed by digital circuits and D/A converters, high flexibility and real-time controllability are achieved. By using one of these new techniques, we have designed and fabricated a CMOS chaos circuit with arbitrary I-D maps using a 0.6 pm CMOS process, and demonstrate from the experimental results that the new chaos circuit successfully generated various chaos with 7.5-7.8 bit precision by using logistic, tent and chaotic-neuron maps.

This paradigm offers a promising opportunity for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to conserve communication resources and minimize latency by only transmitting relevant semantic information. Despite the promising potential of UAV semantic communication networks, resource allocation in this context remains largely unexplored, particularly regarding multi-modal communication that adjusts the types of transmitted information (image, text, video, etc.) according to the task objectives and the available resources. This paper addresses the semantic-oriented resource allocation for multi-modal semantic communication with a focus on the UAV image-sensing task-oriented scenario. Firstly, a multi-modal semantic communication for the original image-sensing tasks of UAVs is designed. Subsequently, a semantic-level resource allocation problem based on the approximate semantic entropy and the semantic rate is formulated in terms of the transmit power allocation, channel assignment, and the number of transmitted semantic symbols. To solve the problem formulated, which involves a hybrid discrete-continuous action space, a novel algorithm called Hybrid-Decision-Controlled Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Semantic Communication Allocation (HDCD-SC) is introduced. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HDCD-SC algorithm can dynamically adjust the transmission modal according to the available resources, and achieve better performance in terms of latency, amount of semantic information, and notable reductions in energy and bandwidth costs when compared to other benchmarks.																			2334-0983	2576-6813	979-8-3503-1090-0				2023							7213	7218		10.1109/GLOBECOM54140.2023.10437885	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM54140.2023.10437885													WOS:001178562007130
J	Evangelista, G; Cavaliere, S				Evangelista, G; Cavaliere, S			Discrete frequency warped wavelets: Theory and applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING												Hn this pager, we extend the definition of dyadic wavelets to include frequency warped wavelets. The new wavelets are generated and the transform computed in discrete-time by alternating the Laguerre transform with perfect reconstruction filterbanks. This scheme provides the unique implementation of orthogonal or biorthogonal warped wavelets by means of rational transfer functions, We show that the discrete-lime warped wavelets lead to well-defined continuous-time wavelet bases, satisfying a warped form of the two-scale equation, The shape of the wavelets is not invariant by translation, Rather, the "wavelet translates" are obtained from one another by allpass biltering. We show that the phase of the delay element is asymptotically a fractal. A feature of the warped wavelet transform is that-the cut-off frequencies of the wavelets malt be arbitrarily assigned while preserving a dyadic structure. The new transform provides an arbitrary tiling of the time-frequency plane, which can be designed by selecting as little as a single parameter. This feature is particularly desirable in cochlear and perceptual models of speech and music, where accurate bandwidth selection is an issue, As our examples show, by defining pitch-synchronous wavelets based on warped wavelets, the analysis of transients and denoising of inharmonic pseudo-periodic signals is greatly enhanced.

J	Tawhid, MA; Savsani, P				Tawhid, Mohamed A.; Savsani, Poonam			Discrete Sine-Cosine Algorithm (DSCA) with Local Search for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												One of the new population-based optimization algorithms, named sine-cosine algorithm (SCA), is introduced to solve continuous optimization problems. SCA utilizes the sine and cosine functions to recast a set of potential solutions to balance between exploration and exploitation in the search space. Many researchers have developed and introduced a modified version of SCA to solve engineering problems, multi-objective version of SCA to solve multi-objective engineering design problems, and a binary version of SCA to deal with datasets. Our goal from this work to propose discrete SCA (DSCA) to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The TSP is one of the typical NP-hard problems. DSCA works on the basic concepts of exploration and exploitation. To balance the exploration and exploitation in DSCA, it uses two different mathematical expressions to update the solutions in each generation. DSCA is combined with 2-opt local search method to improve exploitation. To enhance the exploration heuristic crossover, it is united with the proposed DSCA. A benchmarks problem selected from TSPLIB is used to test the algorithm, and the results show that the DSCA algorithm proposed in this article is comparable with the other state-of-the-art algorithms over a wide range of TSP.

In particular, we do not assume that the nonlinear constraints are explicitly given but that we can only evaluate them and that we know their global Lipschitz constants. The algorithm is a successive linear relaxation method in which we alternate between solving a master problem, which is a mixed-integer linear relaxation of the original problem, and a subproblem, which is designed to tighten the linear relaxation of the next master problem by using the Lipschitz information about the respective functions. By doing so, we follow the ideas of Schmidt, Sirvent, and Wollner (Math Program 178(1):449-483 (2019) and Optim Lett 16(5):1355-1372 (2022)) and improve the tackling of multivariate constraints. Although multivariate nonlinearities obviously increase modeling capabilities, their incorporation also significantly increases the computational burden of the proposed algorithm. We prove the correctness of our method and also derive a worst-case iteration bound. Finally, we show the generality of the addressed problem class and the proposed method by illustrating that both bilevel optimization problems with nonconvex and quadratic lower levels as well as nonlinear and mixed-integer models of gas transport can be tackled by our method. We provide the necessary theory for both applications and briefly illustrate the outcomes of the new method when applied to these two problems.

J	Zhang, YH; Yang, B; Liu, HD; Li, DS				Zhang, Yihu; Yang, Bo; Liu, Haodong; Li, Dongsheng			A time-aware self-attention based neural network model for sequential recommendation	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												Sequential recommendation is one of the hot research topics in recent years. Various sequential recommendation models have been proposed, of which Self-Attention (SA)-based models are shown to have state-of-the-art performance. However, most of the existing SA-based sequential recommendation models do not make use of temporal information, i.e., timestamps of user-item interactions, except for an initial attempt (Li et al., 2020). In this paper, we propose a Time-Aware Transformer for Se-quential Recommendation (TAT4SRec), an SA-based neural network model which utilizes the temporal information and captures users' preferences more precisely. TAT4SRec has two salient features: (1) TAT4SRec utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to model timestamps and interacted items separately and this structure appears to be a better way of making use of the temporal information. (2) in the proposed TAT4SRec, two different embedding modules are designed to transform continuous data (timestamps) and discrete data (item IDs) into embedding matrices respectively. Specifically, we propose a window function-based embedding module to preserve the continuous dependency contained in similar timestamps. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TAT4SRec over various state-of-the-art MC/RNN/SA-based sequential recommendation models under several widely-used metrics. Furthermore, experiments are also performed to show the rationality of the different proposed structures and demonstrate the computation efficiency of TAT4SRec. The promising experimental results make it possible to apply TAT4SRec in various online applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the research on the status of telemedicine application and wireless communication technology, this paper proposes a multi-physical parameter wireless telemedicine health monitoring system solution, and analyzes the overall structure and functional requirements of the system. Human physiological parameters of the wireless remote medical system for health monitoring include body temperature, respiration, blood oxygen saturation, pulse, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram. In this paper, fabric electrodes are used to extract human bioimpedance signals, discrete Fourier transform algorithm is used to detect human respiratory signals, and respiratory rate is detected based on dynamic differential threshold peak detection technology. The reflection type photoelectric sensor is used to realize the reflection of the human pulse signal, and the continuous measurement of the cuff-free blood pressure based on the pulse wave conduction time is combined with the ECG (Electrocardiogram) data. A self-learning threshold algorithm based on near-infrared photo plethysmo graphy signal trough detection is designed on the reflective blood oxygen saturation calculation algorithm. The difference threshold method is used to extract the QRS band feature points. We tested the overall operation of the system. The results show that the collected human physiological signal data is accurate. After a series of tests, the validity and reliability of the collected physiological signals have been proven.

Additionally, the I2V communications can be combined with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity owing to the small area covered by road side units (RSUs). However, dozens of vehicles have to compete for limited bandwidth when they request service simultaneously in the covered area. In this paper, we propose a joint scheduling and power control scheme for I2V and V2V links in the RSUs' coverage range. Mapping the I2V and V2V links to tuple-links, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem where frequency scheduler and power controller for those tuple-links are jointly designed. Then, we employ the delayed column generation technique and the transmission pattern definition to decompose the MINLP problem into a transmission pattern scheduling problem, as well as a power control problem. Therein, the transmission pattern scheduling problem is solved by linear programming while a greedy power control algorithm is developed. Simulation results with practical parameter settings show that our proposed scheme outperforms several conventional schemes in terms of service disruption and achieved throughput while maintaining throughput fairness among the requesting vehicles. In particular, a high channel number, a small power level number, and a large buffer size at the requesting vehicles are shown to be helpful for our proposed scheme.

J	Lizier, JT				Lizier, Joseph T.			JIDT: an information-theoretic toolkit for studying the dynamics of complex systems	FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI												Complex systems are increasingly being viewed as distributed information processing systems, particularly in the domains of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and artificial life. This trend has resulted in a strong uptake in the use of (Shannon) information-theoretic measures to analyze the dynamics of complex systems in these fields. We introduce the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT): a Google code project, which provides a standalone (GNU GPL v3 licensed) open-source code implementation for empirical estimation of information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g., entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information), it ultimately focuses on implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT focuses on quantifying information storage, transfer, and modification, and the dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure, including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g., Gaussian, box-kernel, and Kraskov-Stogbauer-Grassberger), which can be swapped at run-time due to Javas object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java, the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python, and other environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide several examples to guide users.

By this way, it is feasible to produce the composite gels with hierarchical microstructures and desired physical properties. In this study, we fabricated a class of glucono-8-lactone (GDL)-induced composite gels with a fixed casein concentration (8.0%, w/v) and varying alginate addition amounts (Alg, 0?1.0%, w/v). As the Alg concentration increased, the gel hardness was initially increased, but followed by a decreasing trend, which was corresponding to the structural transition of the composite gels. At low Alg concentrations (e.g., 0.1% Alg), the composite gel featured casein-dominant network; with increasing Alg addition (e.g., 0.2?0.5%), the caseins acted as the continuous gelling phase and the Alg served as the dispersed phase. When the Alg concentration was further increased (e.g., 0.75?1.0%), a bicontinuous phase structure was observed. In addition, it was found that with increasing Alg addition, the gel-setting time (Tgel) was monotonously decreased. Despite this, however, the structural evolution of the gels was still observed even after reaching the gelation point, which was dominantly ascribed to the electrostatic attraction between the two polymers that occurred at a pH range below the isoelectric point (pI) of the caseins. Overall, the composite Alg/ casein systems may emerge as a promising template for designing novel gel-related foods.					li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023; Li, Anqi/AAE-9638-2021; Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022; li, xiao/HKV-8405-2023; guo, yu/GQZ-1392-2022; Yang, Xi/AAX-6360-2021	Yang, Xi/0000-0002-4133-4192; Li, Anqi/0000-0001-8236-8797													0268-005X	1873-7137				SEP	2021	118								106775	10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.106775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.106775		MAR 2021											WOS:000647732500002
J	Alshamsi, A; Diabat, A				Alshamsi, Ahmed; Diabat, Ali			Large-scale reverse supply chain network design: An accelerated Benders decomposition algorithm	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING												Reverse logistics (RL) is a term that captures any process that involves the movement of goods or services from their destination back to their source. RL is increasingly gaining recognition as an essential component in the design process of supply chains. In this paper, we formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that aims to determine the optimal locations and capacities of various nodes such as inspection centers and remanufacturing facilities and to help decision makers find optimal transportation decisions and to determine the number and type of transportation units required in the network. We develop an exact method to solve large-scale real-sized instances of this problem. We initially attempt to solve the problem using the traditional Benders Decomposition (BD) technique which fails to solve the problem in reasonable computational times. We improve the traditional BD technique by adding several accelerating methods such as trust-region, logistics constraints, Pareto-optimal cuts, restructuring of the problem, and continuous relaxation of the integer variables to increase the convergence rate and to reduce the total number of cuts required in the master problem. In almost all the instances, we were able to reach optimal solutions. For the remaining instances, we succeed in solving the largest problem with an optimality gap of 0.5% and within a reasonable running time. The paper highlights and evaluates the performance and effectiveness of the different acceleration techniques of our improved BD algorithm along with the computational results.																			0360-8352	1879-0550				OCT	2018	124						545	559		10.1016/j.cie.2018.05.057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2018.05.057													WOS:000444664400043

J	Manivannan, R; Cao, Y				Manivannan, R.; Cao, Yang			Design of generalized dissipativity state estimator for static neural networks including state time delays and leakage delays	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												This paper discusses the issue of generalized dissipativity index for state estimation of static neural networks (SNNs) including leakage delays and state time delays. The integral terms in the time derivative of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) are estimated by the well-known Wirtinger based integral inequality approach. As a result, a novel delay-dependent extended dissipativity state estimation condition is exploited based on the estimated error system is extended dissipative. The notion of the extended dissipativity based state estimation methodology is launched to investigate the L-2 - L-infinity state estimation, H-infinity state estimation, passivity state estimation, mixed H-infinity and passivity state estimation, and (Q, S, R) - gamma-dissipativity state estimation of SNNs by choosing free weighting matrices. Therefore, a new scheme is put forward to quantify multi-dynamic behaviors of SNNs in a combined structure by introducing of the free weighting matrices. The main scope of the addressed problem is to design state estimation criterion to estimate the neuron states such that, in the presence of both leakage delays and state time delays, the dynamics of the estimator error system is extended dissipative. In comparison with some recent results, much better and more dynamic behavior is performed by our methodology, which is immensely assisted from proposing a leakage delays and gain matrix in the system model. The advantage of the established methodology is explored by numerical examples and comparison results also are made along with the previous results. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute.

J	Jang, J; Yang, HJ				Jang, Jonggyu; Yang, Hyun Jong			Deep Learning-Aided User Association and Power Control With Renewable Energy Sources	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS												The renewable energy source (RES)-powered small cell base station (SBS) is a promising technology for the next-generation networks because RESs provide sustainable energy without being depleted. In RES-assisted networks, joint optimization of user association (UA) and power control (PC) is required to enhance the sum-rate performance by reducing inter-cell interference between SBSs. This paper tackles the UA and PC optimization for the sum-rate maximization under quality-of-service (QoS) and backhaul constraints. We formulate the problem as mixed-integer non-linear programming, in which UA and PC variables of different time slots are tightly coupled due to the RES energy dynamics model. Hence, designing a dynamic policy-based UA and PC with consideration of the future environments such as the quantity of channel gain and energy harvesting remains a challenge. First, we propose a deep unsupervised learning (DUL)-based UA scheme for a fixed PC variable. To lower the computational complexity and accelerate the convergence of the proposed learning-based optimization, we relax the UA variable, which originally has an extremely high dimension, into a low-dimensional continuous variable inspired by the Lagrangian method. Next, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based PC scheme, in which the stringent QoS and backhaul constraints are considered penalty terms on the reward design.

J	Wang, K; Wang, W				Wang, Kun; Wang, Wei			Sound absorption performance of EPDM-based textile composites investigated through the transfer matrix model	JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION												With the continuous advancement of networks, communication technology, sensor technology, artificial intelligence and other technologies, the field of intelligent industry is booming. As the leader of emerging technologies, digital twin technology has also become the new direction for the next generation of industrial intelligence. Based on the digital twin technology, kapok fiber and mixed fiber nonwoollen materials were designed at different positions of the microperforation, and a composite sound absorbing material with light weight, simple structure and low cost was developed to improve the sound absorption performance of the composite sound absorbing material. Also, based on the transfer matrix method, a sound absorption model of EPDM-based textile structural composite is proposed. The sound absorption coefficient of the composite sound absorber predicted by the transfer matrix model is completely consistent with the experimental test value. The model can be applied to predict and analyze the sound absorption characteristics of EPDM-based textile composite panel structural materials. This work can provide a theoretical basis and application for the structural design of the perforated plate and the porous non-woven material composite sound absorber.																			1382-6905	1573-2886				JAN	2023	45	1							33	10.1007/s10878-022-00957-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10878-022-00957-9													WOS:000899699100002
J	Singh, M; Shirazian, S; Ranade, V; Walker, GM; Kumar, A				Singh, Mehakpreet; Shirazian, Saeed; Ranade, Vivek; Walker, Gavin M.; Kumar, Ashish			Challenges and opportunities in modelling wet granulation in pharmaceutical industry-A critical review	POWDER TECHNOLOGY												Wet granulation is a key step in the pharmaceutical manufacturing of solid-dosage forms. Wet granulation is used in pharmaceutical production to enhance formulation qualities such as flowability, compressibility, etc. Different methods are used for wet granulation, including fluidised bed, twin-screw extrusion, and high-shear method, leading to different mechanisms and granule properties. Modelling wet granulation is of great importance for the pharmaceutical industry, which is aspiring to shift from batch mode to a continuous one. Moreover, model-based understanding is critical for implementing the Quality-by-Design (QbD) approach in the pharmaceutical industry. The current critical review represents an overview of current approaches in modelling wet granulation. Three major models, including the population balance model (PBM), discrete element method (DEM), and data-driven models, are evaluated, and the advantages of each approach are outlined. The PBM is the primary approach for modelling granulation in which granule properties are tracked in the process. On the other hand, DEM provides a better understanding of granulation at the particle level. Recent DEM modelling studies have significantly advanced the knowledge for design and scale-up of DEM models, such as capturing the suitable wetting physics and particle scaling and thus mitigating the traditionally known challenges in the application of DEM for wet granulation processes. However, further research is required to include particle level effects, like breakage, attrition, into the DEM model through either built-in approaches or hybrid approaches. Data-driven models are fast and accurate but do not investigate the mechanisms involved in granulation. Data-driven models based on neural networks have been indicated to be adopted for application in continuous granulation with great accuracy compared to other approaches, which can also be implemented for process control. A great joint prospect for first-principles and data-driven modelling approaches is anticipated, which can play an important role in future process design, optimisation, and control of pharmaceutical wet granulation processes.

However, there are some conventional concerns such as low bearing capacity of soil, should have been rectified or nullified till date. Actually, various factors such as variation of strata, availability of materials, costing, load, design speed of roadways etc. influences the decision making process and so the concerns are still hanging around. So taking into contemplation, the proposed work is an attempt made for experimental investigation, to stabilize Black Cotton soil via Stone Dust and PET Fiber. The main focus is to find out the effects of stabilizers (SD and PET Fiber) on the strength, compaction characteristics and durability of the soil. All experimental tests have been done according to IS code. The proposed mix design for soil can be used in any type of foundation such as roads, highways, foundation of building or any other engineering structures. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Circumventing data imbalance in magnetic ground state data for magnetic moment predictions	MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Magnetic materials play a crucial role in the transition to more sustainable forms of energy and electric vehicles. There is an anticipated shortage in magnetic materials in the future, and as a result there is an urgent need to discover and design new magnetic materials. Computational magnetic material design using density functional theory is daunting because of the challenge in identifying magnetic ground states from a combinatorially large set of possibilities. Machine learning offers a path forward by enabling efficient surrogate models that can more readily enumerate these states, but there is a dearth of training data available, and what is available tends to be imbalanced with too much non-magnetic data. In this work we show that the discrete and previously tackled data imbalance that exists at the level of the magnetic ordering leads to an imbalanced continuous distribution with many zeros when the data is unraveled at the atomic magnetic moment level, which subsequently leads to models with low accuracy for magnetic properties. We mitigate this by using a two-part model framework. Our scheme is able to classify atoms into magnetic and non-magnetic with an F1 score and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of similar to 91% and then to provide an implicit embedding representation that maps directly onto the magnitude of the magnetic moment with a mean absolute error of 0.1 mu B . Beyond screening for new magnetic materials, we demonstrate an additional practical use case of our scheme: the provision of good initial guesses for magnetic moments in first-principles electronic relaxations. Such initialization is shown to lead to faster convergence to configurations that lie closer to the ground state.					; Kitchin, John/A-2363-2010	Sanspeur, Rohan/0000-0002-5583-8922; Kitchin, John/0000-0003-2625-9232														2632-2153				MAR 1	2024	5	1							015023	10.1088/2632-2153/ad23fb	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/ad23fb													WOS:001158798000001

On the Effects of Time-Delay on Precision Degradation in Fixed Point Transformation-based Adaptive Control	2017 IEEE 30TH NEUMANN COLLOQUIUM (NC)					30th IEEE Neumann Colloquium (NC)	NOV 24-25, 2017	Obuda Univ, Budapest, HUNGARY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, John Neumann Comp Soc Biomed Sect	Obuda Univ			Time delay effects frequently occur in remote control when the signals of observation "travel" from the location of the sensor to that of the controller and the control commands "propagate" from the controller to the drives and/or effectors. Another frequent reason for working with time-delay is the computational time needed by the digital controllers whenever the solution of a continuous control task is realized (and necessarily approximated) by digital controllers operating with discrete time resolution. In several cases the information so travels in the form of "packages" along some communication network that the various packages may have different traveling time and the delay cannot be precisely estimated. In other cases the time need of the signal propagation can be known in advance. Both the traditional model-based controllers as well as the adaptive controllers designed for strongly nonlinear systems the use of the Lyapunov function-based approach is a prevailing technique. It has been extended to time-delayed systems by the use of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. As an alternative of the Lyapunov function-based design the "Fixed Point Transformation-based Adaptive Control" was elaborated that generally so works on the basis of an approximate initial model that it always has to take into consideration fresh observations. The appearance of time-delay to some extent makes the available observed signal "obsolete", therefore it may degrade the precision of the adaptive controller. The present paper is the 1st report on systematic investigations on this degradation effect in the case of a strongly nonlinear system under delayed control. The simulations reveal that tis novel approach may be applicable to delayed systems, too.

J	Peterson, GD; Willis, JC				Peterson, GD; Willis, JC			High-performance hardware description language simulation: Modeling issues and recommended practices	TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR COMPUTER SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL												Parallel simulation of hardware description languages (HDL) is no longer solely a subject of largely academic interest; it is now a significant opportunity for mainstream hardware and system designers. System requirements and system fabrication densities often exceed uni-processor simulation capability, while shared-memory multiprocessors, high-speed networks and parallel processors (platforms) are widely accessible. however, recognition and practice of suitable HDL modeling practices are critical to efficiency satisfying performance requirements using parallel tool capabilities. This paper develops a set of recommended modeling practices intended to boost parallel HDL simulation effectiveness. These modeling practices are part of an effort by the IEEE Design Automation Standards Committee (DASC) group on High Performance Modeling for Simulation (HPMSIM) to develop a set of recommended practices for discrete-event and continuous-domain modeling in VHDL, VHDL-AMS and Verilog. Since the optimal modeling style is tightly related to the parallel machine architecture employed and the simulation algorithms used, both this paper and the DASC effort key specific modeling recommendations to processor architecture and simulation algorithm classes. Parallel simulators are a technical and commercial reality, thanks in part to the intrinsically parallel nature of HDLs, especially VHDL and VHDL-AMS. Simulation efficiency achieved when using such simulators is heavily dependent on the modeling style used to write the HDL model source. From this paper, readers will gain an understanding of the style designers can use to effectively exploit a range of parallel simulators. Our primary focus is on modeling guidelines boosting performance. The utilization efficiency of processors, memory and network resources is a critical but somewhat secondary concern motivating these guidelines (in the absence of performance gains, efficiency is immaterial).

In this supply chain, the demands of customers and the lead times are assumed to be uncertain. Therefore, each distribution center retains some amount of safety stock to provide suitable service level for customers. The proposed non-linear model aims to minimize location and inventory costs of distribution centers, manufacturers and transportation costs subject to relevant constraints. To solve the model, an efficient imperialist competitive algorithm and a Tabu search algorithm, each using variable neighborhood search, are proposed. The model outputs are decisions such as which distribution centers and manufacturers are opened, the allocation of customers to distribution centers, and distribution centers to manufacturers. Results are also the ordering quantity of each opened distribution center and the production rate of each opened manufacturer. The computational results for several instances of the problem are represented to show the efficiency of proposed algorithm.

To properly account for the new characteristics introduced by these three trends in communication system design, the near-field spherical-wave propagation model needs to be used, which differs from the classical far-field planar-wave one. As such, near-field communication (NFC) will become essential in 6G networks. In this tutorial, we cover three key aspects of NFC. 1) Channel Modelling: We commence by reviewing near-field spherical-wave-based channel models for spatially-discrete (SPD) antennas. Then, uniform spherical wave (USW) and non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) models are discussed. Subsequently, we introduce a general near-field channel model for SPD antennas and a Green's function-based channel model for continuous-aperture (CAP) antennas. 2) Beamfocusing and Antenna Architectures: We highlight the properties of near-field beamfocusing and discuss NFC antenna architectures for both SPD and CAP antennas. Moreover, the basic principles of near-field beam training are introduced. 3) Performance Analysis: Finally, we provide a comprehensive performance analysis framework for NFC. For near-field line-of-sight channels, the received signal-to-noise ratio and power-scaling law are derived. For statistical near-field multipath channels, a general analytical framework is proposed, based on which analytical expressions for the outage probability, ergodic channel capacity, and ergodic mutual information are obtained. Finally, for each aspect, topics for future research are discussed.

Marshal			Dissipative Based Adaptive Reliable Sampled-data Control of Time-varying Delay Systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND SYSTEMS												This paper is concerned with the problem of dissipative based adaptive reliable controller for a class of time delay systems subject to actuator failures and time-varying sampling with a known upper bound on the sampling intervals. By constructing a proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional which fully uses the available information about the actual sampling pattern and time delays, a new set of sufficient conditions is derived to obtain the required result. Then, a dissipative based adaptive sampled-data controller is designed such that the resulting closed-loop system is reliable in the sense that it is asymptotically stable and has the prescribed dissipative performance under given constraints. The existence condition of the desired dissipative based adaptive reliable sampled-data controller is obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Further, the performance of the proposed controller is implemented on a liquid propellant rocket motor with a pressure feeding system model. The simulation results show the effectiveness and better performance of the proposed adaptive reliable sampled-data controller over conventional reliable controller.

In these systems, roaming robots transport loads between a storage location and a workstation. Two main variants exist: horizontal, where the robots only move horizontally and use lifts for vertical transport, and a new variant vertical, where the robots can also travel vertically in the rack. This paper builds a framework to analyze the performance of the vertical system and compare its throughput capacity with the horizontal system. We build closed queueing network models for this that, in turn, are used to optimize the design. The results show that the optimal height-to-width ratio of a vertical system is around one. Because a large number of system robots may lead to blocking and delays, we compare the effects of different robot blocking protocols on the system throughput: robot Recirculation and Wait-on-Spot. The Wait-on-Spot policy produces a higher system throughput when the number of robots in the system is small. However, for a large number of robots in the system, the Recirculation policy dominates the Wait-on-Spot policy. Finally, we compare the operational costs of the vertical and horizontal transport systems. For systems with one load/unload (L/U) point, the vertical system always produces a similar or higher system throughput with a lower operating cost compared with the horizontal system with a discrete lift. It also outperforms the horizontal system with a continuous lift in systems with two L/U points.

This article further studies the same problem over jointly connected switching networks that can be disconnected at every time instant by a single-time-scale distributed design. Since the existing distributed designs critically rely on the connectedness assumption on the networks and thus may not apply to jointly connected switching networks, we manage to modify the local observers and develop a novel approach that makes use of the uniform complete observability property for a discrete-time time-varying system. Additionally, we establish two exponential stability results for two classes of discrete-time switched systems, which may be of independent interest.																			0018-9286	1558-2523				NOV	2023	68	11					6836	6843		10.1109/TAC.2023.3241783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2023.3241783													WOS:001129998200033

CIM is the task of selecting a strategy mix x with constraint Sigma(i) x(i) <= k where k is a budget constraint, such that the total number of activated nodes after the diffusion process, called influence spread and denoted as g(x), is maximized. In this paper, we extend CIM to consider budget saving, that is, each strategy mix x has a cost c(x) where c is a convex cost function, and we want to maximize the balanced sum g(x) + lambda(k - c(x)) where lambda is a balance parameter, subject to the constraint of c(x) <= k. We denote this problem as CIM-BS. The objective function of CIM-BS is neither monotone, nor DR-submodular or concave, and thus neither the greedy algorithm nor the standard result on gradient method could be directly applied. Our key innovation is the combination of the gradient method with reverse influence sampling to design algorithms that solve CIM-BS: For the general case, we give an algorithm that achieves (1/2 - epsilon)-approximation, and for the case of independent strategy activations, we present an algorithm that achieves (1 - 1/epsilon - epsilon) approximation.

Constrained, mixed-integer and multi-objective optimisation of building designs by NSGA-II with fitness approximation	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												Reducing building energy demand is a crucial part of the global response to climate change, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) coupled to building performance simulation (BPS) are an increasingly popular tool for this task. Further uptake of EAs in this industry is hindered by BPS being computationally intensive: optimisation runs taking days or longer are impractical in a time-competitive environment. Surrogate fitness models are a possible solution to this problem, but few approaches have been demonstrated for multi-objective, constrained or discrete problems, typical of the optimisation problems in building design. This paper presents a modified version of a surrogate based on radial basis function networks, combined with a deterministic scheme to deal with approximation error in the constraints by allowing some infeasible solutions in the population. Different combinations of these are integrated with Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and applied to three instances of a typical building optimisation problem. The comparisons show that the surrogate and constraint handling combined offer improved run-time and final solution quality. The paper concludes with detailed investigations of the constraint handling and fitness landscape to explain differences in performance. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

C	Hurlburt, G			IEEE	Hurlburt, George			Towards a Dynamic Design Architecture	2014 IT PROFESSIONAL CONFERENCE (IT PRO)					IT Professional Conference (IT Pro)	MAY 22-22, 2014	GAITHERSBURG, MD	IT PROFESSIONAL, SPOPS, IEEE COMPUTER SOC, NIST, NOBLIS				This paper proposes an alternative architecture for systems of systems design. Systems integration has become a costly national problem. Witness the Joint Strike Fighter whose code base has driven massive cost over-runs. Consider the magnitude of revamping the National Airspace, to say nothing of inclusion of all manner of unmanned air vehicles into the mix. Recall the Army's failed Future Combat System, which was brought down by network complexity issues. Clearly, a new architectural paradigm must arise to manage the ever-morphing design of systems of systems. The current breed of static architecture simply cannot accommodate the effects of the hypernetworks that underlie modern system of system technologies. Hypernetworks, or networks of networks, are increasingly pervasive. In such environments, the link between cause and effect is at best stochastic, dependent upon a prolifera of quasi-related state-changing variables all interacting dynamically in real-time. Catastrophic failure always lurks at the edges between relative stability - chaos on one extreme and rigidity at the other. Nonetheless, modern system design still tends to favor the more comfortable side of rigidity where cause and effect are better correlated. The Department of Defense Architectural Framework (DODAF) is one such instance. Dependent upon relational database technology, DODAF cannot effectively manage the multitude of many-to-many relationships necessary to define the hypernetworked world of system of systems. Consider a modern aircraft where digital flight controls interact over a bus with digital engine controls, navigation system controls, environmental control systems and external control networks, all fed by continuous streams of data from myriads of sensors. This is merely a weak forerunner to the growing Internet of Anything (IoA). These phenomena defy the type of static cause and effect relationships predominant in existing reductionist design paradigms. T- ey simply lack the robust and simultaneous many to many relationships necessary to describe hypernetworks. Spring-boarding on award winning work conducted between 2000-2006, this paper proposes a DODAF compliment means of better specifying systems design in such fashion to permit dynamic, time-domain driven interactions to come to the fore. The early premise was that the DODAF Operational View-5 (OV-5) Activity Diagram could actually decompose to the lowest permissible system view. Ironically, the limitation of this view is driven by proprietary software, where performance changing Computer Software Configurable Items (CSCI) remain hidden from view. Other DODAF views can be derived from the OV-5 relationships with adequate definition of properties, including appropriate state and temporal values. Assuming an underlying object oriented data base, a living ontology can be defined to permit synthesis of suitable mission driven OV-5 based scenarios reaching down to the interactions among component systems and subsystems. The follow-on effort builds upon this premise. It permits a user friendly way of building OV-5 activity modules complete with well defined processes, inputs, outputs, constraints and mechanisms (agents). The process repository is envisioned to lives in a Wordpress environment, open to all eligible contributors, persisting process modules composed of verb phrase controlled triples. Synthesis of the modules into workable scenarios, however, takes place in a graph database where graph traversal reveals the multiplicity of relationships necessary to analyze system dynamics. Here, graph metrics can be brought to bear to begin to optimize design solutions that serve to provide performance bounds within tolerances to assure an acceptable range of hypernetwork stability.

More specifically, we invoke the inherent properties of a dual polarized (DP) antenna for transmitting additional information carried by the axial ratio (AR) and tilt angle of elliptic polarization, in addition to the information streams transmitted over its vertical (V) and horizontal (H) components. Furthermore, we propose a special algorithm for generating an improved PM constellation tailored especially for wireless PM modulation. We also provide an analytical framework to compute the average bit error rate (ABER) of the PM system. Furthermore, we characterize both the discrete-input continuous-output memoryless channel (DCMC) capacity and the continuous-input continuous-output memoryless channel (CCMC) capacity as well as the upper and lower bounds of the CCMC capacity. The results show the superiority of our proposed PM system over conventional modulation schemes in terms of both higher throughput and lower BER. In particular, our simulation results indicate that the gain achieved by the proposed Q-dimensional PM scheme spans between 10dB and 20dB compared to the conventional modulation. It is also demonstrated that the PM system attains between 54% and 87.5% improvements in terms of ergodic capacity. Furthermore, we show that this technique can be applied to MIMO systems in a synergistic manner in order to achieve the target data rate target for 5G wireless systems with much less system resources (in terms of bandwidth and the number of antennas) compared to existing MIMO techniques.

This study systematically investigates the vibration mitigation mechanism of tuned IDs (TIDs) for stay cables based on a continuous cable model. A TID consists of an ID connected with a spring stiffness in series (TID-S) or parallel (TID-P). On the basis of systematical parametric analyses, the impact of stiffness in series or parallel connections is evaluated, and the interrelations among ID, TID-S, and TID-P are elaborated. Subsequently, a detailed tuning procedure is summarized. Two optimal tuning formulas are also obtained to facilitate the rapid design of TID-S and TID-P. According to the optimized results, the damping ratios contributed by ID, TID-S, or TID-P to a stay cable are essentially determined by the inertance value. When the inertance deviates from the optimal value, the performance of ID drops significantly, but this adverse effect can be mitigated by tuning the stiffness in TID-S or TID-P.

J	Cajzek, R; Klansek, U				Cajzek, Rok; Klansek, Uros			Cost optimization of project schedules under constrained resources and alternative production processes by mixed-integer nonlinear programming	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT												Purpose The purpose of this paper is cost optimization of project schedules under constrained resources and alternative production processes (APPs). Design/methodology/approach The model contains a cost objective function, generalized precedence relationship constraints, activity duration and start time constraints, lag/lead time constraints, execution mode (EM) constraints, project duration constraints, working time unit assignment constraints and resource constraints. The mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) superstructure of discrete solutions covers time-cost-resource options related to various EMs for project activities as well as variants for production process implementation. Findings The proposed model provides the exact optimal output data for project management, such as network diagrams, Gantt charts, histograms and S-curves. In contrast to classic scheduling approaches, here the optimal project structure is obtained as a model-endogenous decision. The project planner is thus enabled to achieve optimization of the production process simultaneously with resource-constrained scheduling of activities in discrete time units and at a minimum total cost. Originality/value The unique value this paper contributes to the body of knowledge reflects through the proposed MINLP model, which is capable of performing the exact cost optimization of production process (where presence and number of activities including their mutual relations are dealt as feasible alternatives, meaning not as fixed parameters) simultaneously with the associated resource-constrained project scheduling, whereby that is achieved within a uniform procedure.

Vincent			Enhanced User Grouping and Power Allocation for Hybrid mmWave MIMO-NOMA Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and millimeter wave (mmWave) are two key enabling technologies for the fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and beyond. In this paper, we consider uplink communications with a hybrid beamforming structure and focus on improving the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA systems with enhanced user grouping and power allocation. It is noted that the optimization of the SE/EE is a challenging task due to the non-linear programming nature of the corresponding problem involving user grouping, beam selection, and power allocation. Our idea is to decompose the overall optimization problem into a mixed integer problem comprised of user grouping and beam selection only, followed by a continuous problem involving power allocation and digital beamforming design. Exploiting the directionality property of mmWave channels, we first propose a novel initial agglomerative nesting (AGNES) based user grouping algorithm by taking advantage of the channel correlations. To avoid the prohibitively high complexity of the brute-force search approach and to address the overlapping beam problem, we propose two suboptimal low-complexity user grouping and beam selection schemes, the two-stage direct AGNES (D-AGNES) scheme and the joint successive AGNES (S-AGNES) scheme. We also introduce the quadratic transform (QT) to recast the non-convex power allocation optimization problem into a convex one subject to a minimum required data rate of each user. The continuous problem is solved by iteratively optimizing the power and the digital beamforming. Extensive simulation results have shown that our proposed mmWave-NOMA design outperforms the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scenario and the state-of-art NOMA schemes.

Subsequently, the MM powder was compacted by spark-plasma sintering (SPS) process. The sintered compacts indicated two structure areas: (i) ultra-fine grained (UFG) regions, called "shell", and (ii) the coarse grained regions called "core". The "shell" and the "core" correspond to the surface and center of the MM powders, respectively. The shell regions established a continuous three dimensional network of high strength ultra-fine grained regions, which surrounded the discrete coarse grained ductile regions. Such a microstructure is referred as "Harmonic Structure". The sintered Co-Cr-Mo alloy compacts exhibited outstanding mechanical properties. The yield strength increased from 605 to 635 MPa, and ultimate tensile strength increased from 1201 to 1283 MPa. Moreover, the elongation was maintained more or less same as that of coarse grained compacts. Therefore, the harmonic structure design leads to the new generation microstructure of Co-Cr-Mo alloy, which demonstrates outstanding mechanical properties, i.e. superior strength and excellent ductility as compared to conventional materials.

Specifically, the secondary UAV transmits confidential information to multiple secondary legitimate receivers with NOMA by sharing the spectrum with the primary networks, while an eavesdropper (Eve) attempts to wiretap the communication. We aim to jointly optimize the three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectory and power allocation to maximize the worst-case average secrecy sum rate of all secondary receivers (SRs) while keeping the interference to primal receivers (PRs) below a certain threshold. The formulated problem is mixed-binary non-convex and is generally NP-hard. To address this issue, we first equivalently transform the binary variables into continuous ones by introducing tractable inequality constraints. Then, we decompose the optimization problem into two subproblems and develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximate (SCA) technique, block coordinate descent (BCD) technique, and penalty function method. Numerical results are extensively studied to show that the proposed joint design significantly outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of secrecy rate.					tang, na/HLH-6081-2023	Tang, Hongying/0000-0002-2606-9570; , na/0000-0003-3672-7909													2169-3536						2020	8						159965	159978		10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3020821	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3020821													WOS:000570084700001

The average unsteady effects due to neighboring blades and/or vanes are approximated using deterministic stresses along with the application of bodyforces. Bodyforces are used to account for the "potential" interaction between closely coupled (staged) rows. Deterministic stresses account for the "average" wake blockage and mixing effects both axially and radially. The attempt here is to implement an approximate technique for incorporating periodic unsteady flow physics that provides for a robust multistage design procedure incorporating reasonable computational efficiency. The present paper gives the theoretical development of the stress/bodyforce models incorporated in the code, and demonstrates the usefulness of these models in practical compressor applications. Compressor performance prediction capability is then established through a rigorous code/model validation effort using the power of networked workstations. The numerical results are compared with experimental data in terms of one-dimensional performance parameters such as total pressure ratio and circumferentially averaged radial profiles deemed critical to compressor design. This methodology allows the designer to design from hub to tip with a high level of confidence in the procedure.																			0889-504X					APR	1998	120	2					205	214		10.1115/1.2841395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.2841395													WOS:000073264900001

This work proposes a wide bandwidth disembodied polynomial chaos approach low-noise amplifier (LNA) with microcontroller compatibility for 5G wireless secure communication.

Traditionally, FRR is provided by synchronous generators. Advanced control and monitoring technologies have enabled loads to provide fast and discrete PFC, which is complementary to the slow and continuous governor response provided by synchronous generators. In this paper, the performance of the PFC provided by the load is benchmarked by the equivalent amount of NEC provided by the synchronous generators at each typical system inertia condition using the actual dynamic network models and operation data of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system. Then, a new real-time PFC market mechanism is proposed to accept and value the ITC offers from both generators and loads. A few case studies are presented to illustrate the new market mechanism and demonstrate its effectiveness for mitigating price spikes. The results of this paper are applicable to other low-inertia power grids similar to the ERCOT system for procuring ancillary services that are essential to host high penetration of renewable resources.

In order to avoid a biased meta-learner and improve its generalizability, this paper proposes a generic meta learning method that aims to learn an unbiased meta learner towards a variety of tasks before its initial model is adapted to unseen tasks. Specifically, this paper presents a meta weight learning method for minimizing the inequality of performance across different training tasks. An end-to-end training approach is introduced for the proposed algorithm that allows for effectively learning weight and initializing the network model. Alternatively, a variety of measurement methods of weight is also designed to test the effectiveness of different weight learning methods on the improvement of model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed meta weight learning method not only outperforms state-of-the-art meta learning algorithms, but also is superior to other manually designed measurement methods of weight on discrete and continuous control problems.

A Two-echelon joint continuous-discrete location model	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												The problem of locating up to a given number of facilities in continuous Euclidean space that can serve as intermediate transshipment points between multiple stakeholders in a supply chain suppliers and customers who are distributed over the same space is considered. The first contribution is in considering the multisource Weber problem (MWP) in the presence of both source points and demand points rather than either alone. The second contribution is that the selection of intermediate facilities for further discrete analysis is based on a quantitative determination rather than a subjective selection process, which is typical of most popular commercial-grade mathematical programming (LP and IP) based location models. While the mathematical programming approach benefits from a degree of richness in features and a sense of computational optimization, one limitation is that the candidate locations to be evaluated must be specified, often without any computational basis for them. Computational experiments on randomly generated problem instances and real case studies indicate that significant gains can be achieved with relatively little effort by expanding the boundary of analysis to include multiple suppliers and multiple customers in the analysis and design of a supply chain network. An alternating location-allocation-type heuristic method is developed that is easy to implement. The third contribution is the development of two different lower bounding procedures that demonstrate the high quality of this obtained heuristic solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The bigels were prepared by mixing xanthan gum (XG) hydrogel and oleogel structured by fatty acid mixtures (stearic acid and myristic acid) in different proportions. The foamed emulsion was prepared by whipping the bigel. The influence of oleogel/ hydrogel ratio on the microstructure, rheological properties and thermal properties of bigel and bigel-based foamed emulsion were investigated. It was observed that with the increase of oil phase, the system changed from oleogel/hydrogel to bicontinuous, and to hydrogel/oleogel state, which was a typical characteristic of bigel system. The system was observed with higher G ', crystallinity and melting enthalpy when oleogel was the continuous phase. During the whipping process, oleogel changed from the dispersed phase to the continuous phase, even at low oil proportion. The aqueous phase and air bubbles were incorporated into the oleogel matrix as the dispersed phase. When the oil content reached 50%, a uniform bigel-based foamed emulsion with enhanced stability was obtained, where fatty acid crystals serve as the primary stabilizers. Some crystals in the oil phase adsorbed to the air-oil interface, and others formed a continuous 3-dimensional network structure in the bulk phase to stabilize the whole system. The resultant bigel-based foamed emulsion was temperature sensitive. It exhibited ultra-high stability at low temperature, while rapidly collapsed at high temperature (T > Tm). These results highlighted the importance of oleogel/hydrogel proportion and fat crystals in formation and properties of the bigel-based foamed emulsions, which assisted in rational design of lipid formulations with distinct texture.

In this formulation, the problem is a combination of an (r, Q) and periodic review policies based on which an order of size Q is placed by a buyer in each fixed period once his/her on hand inventory reaches the reorder point r in that period. The constraints are the vendors' warehouse spaces, production restrictions, and total budget. The aim is to find the optimal order quantities of the buyers placed for each vendor in each period alongside the optimal placement of the vendors among the buyers such that the total supply chain cost is minimized. Due to the complexity of the problem, a Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA) and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used to find optimal and near-optimum solutions. In order to assess the quality of the solutions obtained by the algorithms, a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) of the problem is coded in GAMS. A design of experiment approach named Taguchi is utilized to adjust the parameters of the algorithms. Finally, a wide range of numerical illustrations is generated and solved to evaluate the performances of the algorithms. The results show that the MGA outperforms the PSO in terms of the fitness function in most of the problems and also is faster than the PSO in terms of CPU time in all the numerical examples.

J	Cantú, VH; Ponsich, A; Azzaro-Pantel, C; Carrera, E				Cantu, Victor H.; Ponsich, Antonin; Azzaro-Pantel, Catherine; Carrera, Eduardo			Capturing spatial, time-wise and technological detail in hydrogen supply chains: A bi-level multi-objective optimization approach	APPLIED ENERGY												This study presents a methodological framework for designing a hydrogen supply chain (HSC) utilizing a superstructure that incorporates various alternatives for feedstock, production, storage, transportation, and distribution. The framework features a mixed-integer non-linear mathematical model that includes innovative factors such as power efficiencies, continuous sizing capacities, and time-varying costs of different energy feedstocks related to the learning rate. Furthermore, emerging production technologies such as alkaline electrolysis and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, along with steam methane reforming with carbon capture, utilization, and storage, are considered. To address the resulting bi-objective optimization problem that aims to minimize both total daily costs and greenhouse gas emissions, a specialized solution strategy based on bi-level decomposition and a matheuristic algorithm is developed. This methodology for designing HSCs is applied to a case study in southern France, demonstrating the effectiveness of the solution technique in approximating the Pareto frontier. By analyzing in detail selected relevant solutions along the Pareto front, insights into the spatial, temporal, and technological deployment of the HSC are gained, enabling decision-makers to make informed choices based on economic and environmental criteria.

However, most existing works adopted an ideal IRS reflection model, which is impractical and can cause significant performance degradation in realistic wideband systems. To address this issue, we first study the dual phase- and amplitude-squint effect of reflected signals and present a simplified practical IRS reflection model for wideband signals. Then, an IRS enhanced wideband multiuser multi-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-MISO-OFDM) system is investigated. We aim to jointly design the transmit beamformer and IRS reflection for the case of using both continuous and discrete phase shifters to maximize the average sum-rate over all subcarriers. By exploiting the relationship between sum-rate maximization and mean square error (MSE) minimization, the original problem is equivalently transformed into a multi-block/variable problem, which can be efficiently solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Complexity and convergence for both cases are analyzed or illustrated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can offer significant average sum-rate enhancement compared to that achieved using the ideal IRS reflection model, which confirms the importance of the use of the practical model for the design of wideband systems.

New Hilbert Space Tools for Analysis of Graph Laplacians and Markov Processes	COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY												Themain objective of this paper is to develop the concepts and ideas used in the theory of weighted networks on infinite graphs. Our basic ingredients are a standard Borel space (V, B) and symmetric s-finite measure rho on (VxV, BxB) supported by a symmetric Borel subset E subset of V xV. This setting is analogous to that of weighted networks and are used in various areas of mathematics such as Dirichlet forms, graphons, Borel equivalence relations, Guassian processes, determinantal point processes, joinings, etc. We define and study the properties of a measurable analogue of the graph Laplacian, finite energy Hilbert space, dissipation Hilbert space, and reversible Markov processes associated directly with themeasurable framework. In the settings of networks on infinite graphs and standard Borel space, our present focus will be on the following two dichotomies: (i) Discrete vs continuous (or rather the measurable category); and (ii) deterministic vs stochastic. Both (i) and (ii) will be made precise inside our paper; in fact, this part constitutes a separate issue of independent interest. A main question we shall address in connection with both (i) and (ii) is that of limits. For example, what are the useful notions, and results, which yield measurable limits; more precisely, Borel structures arising as "limits" of systems of graph networks? We shall study it both in the abstract, and via concrete examples, especially models built on Bratteli diagrams. The question of limits is of basic interest; both as part of the study of dynamical systems on path- space; and also with regards to numerical considerations; and design of simulations. The particular contexts for the study of this question entails a careful design of appropriate Hilbert spaces, as well as operators acting between them. Our main results include: an explicit spectral theory for measure theoretic graph-Laplace operators; new properties of Green's functions and corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces; structure theorems of the set of harmonic functions in L2-spaces and finite energy Hilbert spaces; the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces related to Laplace operators; a rigorous analysis of the Laplacian on Borel equivalence relations; a new decomposition theory; irreducibility criteria; dynamical systems governed by endomorphisms and measurable fields; and path-space measures and induced dissipation Hilbert spaces. We discuss also several applications of our results to other fields such as machine learning problems, ergodic theory, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.																			1661-8254	1661-8262				OCT	2023	17	7							111	10.1007/s11785-023-01412-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11785-023-01412-1													WOS:001069446600001

Integration of Production Planning and Scheduling	10TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING	Computer-Aided Chemical Engineering				10th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering	AUG 16-20, 2009	Salvador, BRAZIL					We start our presentation with an overview of supply chain management, the associated planning problems, and a motivation for the integration of medium-term production planning and short-term scheduling decisions (Maravelias and Sung, 2008). We briefly review existing modeling and solution methods and then present four new approaches to this integrated problem. First, we discuss how lot-sizing problems can be extended to address features often found in process networks (Sung and Maravelias, 2008). Specifically, we discuss the problem where a) multiple items can be produced in each planning period, b) sequence-independent setups can carry over from previous periods, c) setups can cross over planning period boundaries, and d) setups can be longer than one period. We develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for this generalized problem and derive a number of optimality properties that can be used to tighten the formulation. We also discuss a network representation and the resulting MIP formulation. We present examples that illustrate how the proposed model can be used to address medium -size single- and multi-unit problems. Second, we develop polyhedral results for a discrete-time state-task network (STN) formulation for the production planning of multi-stage continuous processes (Maravelias and Papalamprou, 2009). Specifically, we express the feasible region of the LP-relaxation as the intersection of two sets. We show that the constraints describing the first set yield the convex hull of its integer points. For the second set, we show that for integral data the constraint matrix is kappa-regular, and that the corresponding polyhedron is integral if the length of the planning period is selected appropriately. We use this result to prove that for rational data, integer variables assume integral values at the vertices of the polyhedron. We also discuss special cases of this problem, for which we derive stronger results. We illustrate how these results can be used to effectively address large-scale production planning problems. Third, we present a projection-based method where a detailed MIP scheduling model is used off-line to obtain a convex approximation of feasible production levels and a convex underestimation of total production cost as a function of production levels (Sung and Maravelias, 2007). These approximations involve only planning variables yet provide all the relevant scheduling information necessary to solve the integrated problem with high quality. We then develop two MIP formulations for the representation of nonconvex regions: the first expresses non-convex regions as unions of polytopes, while the second as difference of polytopes. We use these formulations to generate a non-convex projection of the scheduling feasible region onto the space of production level variables (Sung and Maravelias, 2009). We discuss how this method can be used in a rolling-horizon manner to address hard planning-scheduling problems, as well as a process design tool. Finally, we discuss methods for the decomposition of planning-scheduling problems in multi-stage batch processes (Ferris et al., 2009). We generate subproblems based on fixing: a) batching decisions, b) batch-unit assignment variables in a bottlenecking stage, c) the last batch in the sequence on each unit of the bottlenecking stage, and d) strong branching. We discuss how the above methods can be combined and carried out in a dynamic fashion exploiting the natural hierarchy of decisions (batching -> unit-task assignment -> sequencing). We also discuss the implementation of this dynamic decomposition algorithm within GAMS using the master-worker paradigm: the master processor generates and spawns all the tasks to worker processors, collects the results, and communicates information among workers; worker processors are part of a computational grid. We present computational results on a collection of six instances of varying difficulty.

The continuous dryer plays a pivotal role in industrial usage. In this study, exergy and energy analyses of multistage fluidized bed drying of Barnyard millet with stages connected externally were examined. The dryer was operated by changing wall temperature of stages (313-328 K), air inlet velocity (1.01-1.3 m/s), downcomer height (50-70 mm), and flow rate of solids (5-10 kg/h). Drying characteristics of Barnyard millet by changing process operating conditions of the dryer, were reported and the energy utilization ratio, exergy loss and exergy efficiency of dryer were also reported. The EUR of dryer at steady state has been found to be in the range of 0.25-0.46 and the maximum exergy efficiency of dryer was observed as 0.64 and lowest as 0.371 in the continuous drying process. Practical Applications Fluidized beds offer many distinct features and advantages for processing of particulate food materials. To decrease the drying time than that for single stage dryers, continuous multistage fluidized bed dryer was introduced. Reducing moisture content from feed materials in continuous dryers while discharging continuously, helps to process large quantity of solid materials with good quality of product. Several dryers with different modifications and designs have been suggested by many earlier investigators but continuous dryers play significant role in particulate industry. The multistage dryer is designed by connecting two or more fluidized beds internally or externally, where each bed is termed as a stage. Advantages of the multistage dryer are improvement in gas-solid axial mixing, which results in good quality of product. Due to stage-wise contact of solids with gas, dried product with uniform moisture content can be obtained.

J	Tsai, ZR				Tsai, Zhi-Ren			Robust digital design of continuous-time nonlinear control systems using adaptive prediction and random-local-optimal NARMAX model	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION												In this paper the time-delay and uncertainty of continuous-time (CT) systems are considered, and it is suggested that input and output of a discrete-time (DT) Neural Plant Model (NPM) and recursive neural controller have scaling factors which limit the value zone of measured data from a system. Adapted scaling factors cause the tuned parameters to converge to obtain a robust control performance. However, the proposed Random-Local-Optimization (RLO) design for a model/controller uses off-line initialization to obtain a near global optimal model/controller. Other important issues are the considerations of cost, greater flexibility, and highly reliable digital products for these control problems. This issue of DT control design for CT plant is more difficult than that of CT control design for CT plant, because of the need to process the modeling error between the CT plant and DT model. The input-delay, uncertainty, and sampling distortion of a CT nonlinear power system need to be solved by developing a digital model-based controller. Here, this is called the DT tracking control design of CT systems (DT-CT). Therefore, the DT structure of the adaptive controller for the CT nonlinear power system should be designed as a kind of feed-forward-Recursive-Predictive controller (FRP). First, due to the problem of delays, a digital neural controller with feed-forward of the reference signal and a Nonlinear Auto-Regressive Moving Average eXogenous (NARMAX) neural model design is adopted to reduce this difficulty. The most important contribution is that the more reasonable and systematic two-stage control design, the CT nonlinear delayed system to be controlled is modeled using a NARMAX technique with the first-stage (off-line) method by the proposed global optimal network algorithm and second-stage (on-line) adaptive steps. Second, the dynamic response of the system is controlled by an adaptive NARMAX neural controller via a sensitivity function. A theorizing method is then proposed to replace the sensitivity calculation, which reduces the calculation of Jacobin matrices of the BP method. Finally, the feed-forward input of reference signals helps the digital neural controller to improve the control performance, and the technique works to control the CT systems precisely.

J	Jiang, W; Fahimi, B				Jiang, Wei; Fahimi, Babak			Multiport Power Electronic Interface-Concept, Modeling, and Design	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS												The continuous effort to improve efficiency, reduce particle, and greenhouse gase emissions leads to the emergence of the concept "more electric." This concept helps to boost the performance as well as the flexibility of the domestic and vehicular applications; however, on the other hand, it excessively burdens current power networks (including vehicle power systems). In order to remedy this problem, simultaneous usage of renewable sources and energy storages is encouraged. A multiconverter system is commonly adopted to process the renewable power in form of distributed generation. However, due to the discrete structure of such systems, power flow and load regulation are coordinated via communication channel, which inevitably reduces the reliability and dynamic response of the system. This paper presents the concept of multiport power electronic interface (MPEI) for renewable energy sources and storages. With a unified modular topology and highly integrated digital control system, controlled quasi-current source is achieved for each input port in both steady-state and transient power-sharing modes. MPEI analysis, modeling, design, and system operation are treated in a systematic manner in this paper. Both power stages and digital control system are implemented for a five-port MPEI. Experiments are conducted under meaningful operation scenarios. The results are presented to prove the feasibility of MPEI concept and system design methodology.					wei, jiang/GRX-7907-2022; Chen, Tianren/AAS-6018-2021; Fahimi, BABAK/GQP-1845-2022	Jiang, Wei/0000-0003-0178-2270													0885-8993	1941-0107				JUL	2011	26	7					1890	1900		10.1109/TPEL.2010.2093583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2093583													WOS:000293751000010
J	Zhao, JD; Feng, YZ; Yang, C				Zhao, Jiandong; Feng, Yingzi; Yang, Cai			Intelligent control and energy saving evaluation of highway tunnel lighting: Based on three-dimensional simulation and long short-term memory optimization algorithm	TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY												Traditional tunnel lighting luminance is calculated based on the designed hourly traffic volume and designed speed. This approach first determined the entrance section reduction factor and middle section's luminance through the look-up table method, then calculated each section's luminance in proportion. Since the designed value is often higher than the actual traffic flow value, and the calculated brightness value is so high which might lead to tunnel energy consumption. What's more, the designed value in this method is the piecewise discrete value, which does not meet the requirement of continuous dimming for LED lighting. In this case, under the premise of satisfying operation safety, how to carry out continuous intelligent energy saving control research and energy saving evaluation based on actual traffic value is an urgent problem to be solved in tunnel lighting. This paper first proposed a luminance calculation model for each lighting section which can realize continuous dimming as needed. Using the least squares method fitting the reduction coefficient and the luminance of the middle section to solve the luminance of the entrance and middle sections under the condition of any speed and traffic flow, and realizing the continuous optimization of the luminance calculation. Second, in terms of the shortcomings of the traditional graded dimmer control, this paper offered a highway tunnel lighting intelligent control algorithm with traffic flow, speed and luminance out of the tunnel as the input matrix, which meets the requirement of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, tunnel lighting characteristics and tunnel lighting section. Considering the objective function of optimization problem in LSTM, three gradient descent methods were introduced to optimize the model respectively. Third, this paper adopted equal proportion to arrange lamps and light distribution, and developed a tunnel lighting simulation environment based on DIALux to meet the energy conservation assessment requirements in operating tunnels. Roadway luminance and its total uniformity are selected as energy saving evaluation indexes. Finally, we established a three-dimensional tunnel model with the real environment of Jinding Lake 2# tunnel, then conducted simulations and experimental verifications of the intelligent control algorithm under sunny and cloudy weather conditions, and verified the performance of the intelligent lighting control algorithm under the three optimizers. The result of energy conservation evaluations shows that compared with traditional lighting design, the tunnel lighting energy conservation algorithm can save 23.61% of energy in sunny days and 31.40% in cloudy days.

Most existing approaches to input and output selection focus on nominal systems with known parameters. For systems with uncertainties and time delays, current selection methods are based on exploiting the convexity after relaxing the original problem, which is inherently discrete, to continuous optimization forms, and hence lack optimality guarantees. This paper studies the problem of identifying the minimum-size sets of input and output nodes to guarantee stability of a linear system with uncertainties and time delays. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of a stabilizing controller for an uncertain linear system, based on a subset of system modes lying within the controllability and observability subspaces induced by the selected inputs and outputs. We then formulate the problems of selecting minimum-size sets of input and output nodes to satisfy the derived conditions, and prove that they are equivalent to discrete optimization problems with bounded submodularity ratios. We develop polynomial-time selection algorithms with provable guarantees on the minimum number of inputs and outputs required. Our approach is applicable to various types of uncertainties, including additive uncertainty, multiplicative uncertainty, uncertain output delay, and structured uncertainty. In a numerical study, we test our approach for the wide-area damping control in power systems to ensure small signal stability. Our results are validated on the IEEE 39-bus test power system.

J	Cai, ZC; Chen, L; Liu, HL				Cai, Zicheng; Chen, Lei; Liu, Hai-Lin			EPC-DARTS: Efficient partial channel connection for differentiable architecture search	NEURAL NETWORKS												With weight-sharing and continuous relaxation strategies, the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) proposes a fast and effective solution to perform neural network architecture search in various deep learning tasks. However, unresolved issues, such as the inefficient memory utilization, and the poor stability of the search architecture due to channels randomly selected, which has even caused performance collapses, are still perplexing researchers and practitioners. In this paper, a novel efficient channel attention mechanism based on partial channel connection for differentiable neural architecture search, termed EPC-DARTS, is proposed to address these two issues. Specifically, we design an efficient channel attention module, which is applied to capture cross-channel interactions and assign weight based on channel importance, to dramatically improve search efficiency and reduce memory occupation. Moreover, only partial channels with higher weights in the mixed calculation of operation are used through the efficient channel attention mechanism, and thus unstable network architectures obtained by the random selection operation can also be avoided in the proposed EPC-DARTS.

The key of this approach is to find the approximate solution of the discrete regulator equations associated with the spherical inverted pendulum system, which are governed by ten nonlinear algebraic functional equations. However, it is quite tedious to obtain the approximate solution of the discrete regulator equations. In this paper. an improved discrete-time neural network controller is proposed, which is based on the neural network approximation of the feedforward function without solving the discrete regulator equations approximately. Since the dimension of the feedforward function is only equal to two, this new scheme is much simpler than the existing neural network approach. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of our design.

The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences instituted the Common Metrics Initiative with the goal of evaluating the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Programs using a standard set of metrics. Initially managed by Tufts University, the Center for Leading Innovation and Collaboration (CLIC) at the University of Rochester began leading this initiative in 2017. In directing this work, CLIC created a framework for communicating and disseminating data insights. Insights to Inspire emerged from the need to share strategies and lessons learned to improve metric performance at the local level to a network of 60+ academic research institutions. Insights to Inspire employs a mixed methods approach for translating data into actionable intelligence. A series of blogs, webinars, and webcasts were designed to communicate metric-specific strategies used by individual sites to the broader CTSA consortium. A dissemination plan to expand the reach beyond metric stakeholders utilized focused communications including social media channels, network newsletters, and presentations at national meetings. This framework serves as a blueprint for other national evaluation programs interested in a systematic approach to using data insights for continuous improvement.

Service differentiation is based on the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) originally designed to support best-effort data services. We extend the Distributed Coordination Function to provide service differentiation for delay sensitive and best-effort traffic. Two distributed estimation algorithms are proposed and analyzed. A Virtual MAC (VMAC) algorithm passively monitors the radio channel and estimates locally achievable service levels. The Virtual MAC estimates key MAC level statistics related to service quality such as delay, delay variation, packet collision and packet loss. We show the efficiency of the Virtual MAC algorithm and consider significantly overlapping cells and highly bursty traffic mixes. A Virtual Source (VS) algorithm utilizes the Virtual MAC to estimate application level service quality. The Virtual Source allows application parameters to be tuned in response to dynamic channel conditions based on "virtual delay curves". We demonstrate through simulation that when these distributed virtual algorithms are applied to the admission control of the radio channel then a globally stable state can be maintained without the need for complex centralized radio resource management. Finally, we discuss a distributed service level management scheme that builds on the proposed algorithms to offer continuous service with handoff.																			0743-166X		0-7803-7016-3				2001							582	590																WOS:000172440900062

Due to the complexity of the mixed batch and continuous polymerisation process, an integrated process integration approach, which consists of process synthesis, analysis and optimisation was used for this work. A simulation model was first developed in a batch process simulation software, SuperPro Designer V6.0, based on the operating condition of a PVC manufacturing process. The batch simulation model captured the essential information needed for a water minimisation study, e.g. process duration, water mass flow, etc. Data extracted from the simulation model was later used in the water minimisation study, utilising the widely established process synthesis technique of water pinch analysis. Two water saving scenarios were presented. Scenario 1 reports a fresh water and wastewater reduction of 28.5 and 90.1% respectively, for the maximum water recovery scheme without water storage system. In Scenario 2, higher fresh water and wastewater reduction are reported at 31.7 and 100% respectively, when water storage tank is installed in the water network.					Foo, Ir Dr Dominic C.

To meet this technical challenge, some LCSs have been designed to learn fuzzy logic rules. They can be largely classified into strength-based and accuracy-based systems. The latter is gaining more research attention in the last decade. However, existing accuracy-based learning systems either address primarily single-step learning problems or require the action space to be discrete. In this paper, a new accuracy-based learning fuzzy classifier system (LFCS) is developed to explicitly handle continuous state input and continuous action output during multistep reinforcement learning. Several technical improvements have been achieved while developing the new learning algorithm. Particularly, we have successfully extended Q-learning like credit assignment methods to continuous spaces. To enable direct learning of stochastic strategies for action selection, we have also proposed to use a new fuzzy logic system with stochastic action outputs. Moreover, fine-grained learning of fuzzy rules has been achieved effectively in our algorithm by using a natural gradient learning method. It is the first time that these techniques are utilized substantially in any accuracy-based LFCSs. Meanwhile, in comparison with several recently proposed learning algorithms, our algorithm is shown to perform highly competitively on four benchmark learning problems and a robotics problem. The practical usefulness of our algorithm is also demonstrated by improving the performance of a wireless body area network.

The proposed method is based on the minimization of the energy function of Hopfield neural networks. In the proposed method, the optimal solution for each filter gain factor is first searched for, then the optimal filter gain factor is selected. Therefore, a good solution in the specified criterion can be obtained. The feature of the proposed method is that it can be used to design FIR linear phase filters with different criterions simultaneously. A design example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.																			0916-8508	1745-1337				AUG	1995	E78A	8					900	904																WOS:A1995RR13900002

The three factors, including magnetic induction, pulp density and leaching temperature, are divided into three levels respectively, and the initial pH value is kept at the specific value, 2, in the experiments. The pH value and redox potential (E-h) were firstly recorded on the sixth day and continued to be done at the interval of three days, in the process of the experiment. The tendency charts were made by mathematical software at the end (27(th) day) of the experiments. The final optimal combination was gotten, combining with analysis of variance and Cu2+ leaching concentration, under the discrete condition. Bp neural network model was established to optimize orthogonal experiment results, continued the discrete data and excavated experiment information, in order to improve the Cu2+ leaching concentration, and ultimately determined the optimal combination. The highest leaching rate of copper could been reached when the experiments were conducted under the condition of the simulated optimal combination, 9.6 mT of magnetic induction intensity, 11.3% of pulp concentration and 27.1 degrees C of leaching temperature. Confirmatory trial was conducted, finding the Cu2+ leaching concentration was 39.56%, which was higher than that of orthogonal experiments, 38.72%.																			0974-262X	2278-4543				OCT	2013	6				4		299	307																WOS:000325056000035

Six structurally diverse Cu-I(b3pmdc) architectures were isolated, as well as a single oxidized Cu-II(b3pmdc) species.

Rolling stock mm different fleets are routed to maintenance facilities by interchanging the destinations of trains at common stations and by using empty drives. We consider the problem of locating maintenance facilities in a railway network under uncertain or changing line planning, fleet planning, and other uncertain factors. These uncertainties and changes are modeled by a discrete set of scenarios. We show that this new problem is NP-hard and provide a two-stage stochastic programming and a two-stage robust optimization formulation. The second-stage decision is a maintenance routing problem with similarity to a minimum cost-flow problem. We prove that the facility location decisions remain unchanged under a simplified routing problem, and this gives rise to an efficient mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation. This result also allows us to find an efficient decomposition algorithm for the robust formulation based on scenario addition (SA). Computational work shows that our improved MIP formulation can efficiently solve instances of industrial size. SA improves the computational time for the robust formulation even further and can handle larger instances due to more efficient memory usage. Finally, we apply our algorithms on practical instances of the Netherlands Railways and give managerial insights.

Further, an algorithm with a defined modelling index is proposed to integrate and to guarantee that the proposed neural-based optimal fuzzy controller can stabilize physical systems; the modelling index is defined to denote the modelling-error evolution, and to ensure that the training data for neural learning can describe the physical system behavior very well; the algorithm, which integrates the neural-based fuzzy modelling and optimal fuzzy controlling process, can implement off-line modelling and on-line optimal control for model-free physical systems. The neural-fuzzy inference network is a self-organizing inference system to learn fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy-subsystems' parameters as data feeding in. Based on the generated T-S fuzzy models for the continuous mass-spring-damper system and Chua's chaotic circuit, discrete-time model car system and articulated vehicle, their corresponding fuzzy controllers are formulated from both local-concept and global-concept fuzzy approach, respectively.

Sensors equipped in the vehicles are responsible for accumulating data from the environment, followed by the fusion process. Such fusion process provides accurate and stable data required for the applications in a recurrent manner. In order to enhance the data fusion of connected vehicles, this article introduces multi-variate data fusion (MVDF) technique. This technique is competent in handling asynchronous and discrete data from the environment and streamlining them into continuous and delay-less inputs for the applications. The process of data fusion is aided through least square regression learning to determine the errors in different time instances. The indefinite and definite data fusion instances are differentiated using this regression model to identify the errors in fore-hand. Besides, the differentiation relies on the application run-time interval to progress data fusion within the same or extended time instance and data slots. In this manner the differentiation along with the error identification is regular until the application required data is met. The performance of this technique is verified using network simulator experiments for the metrics error, data utilization ratio, and computation time. The results show that this technique improves data utilization under controlled time and fewer errors.

According to impulsive control theory, we present some Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the concerned system. It is shown that the stabilizing effect of SDD impulses on an unstable SDD system changes the stability and achieves desired performance. In addition, the destabilizing effect of SDD impulses is also fully considered and the corresponding sufficient conditions are derived, which reveals the fact that a stable SDD system can maintain its performance when it is subject to SDD impulsive disturbance. As an application, the proposed result can be employed to the stability analysis of impulsive genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) with SDD and the corresponding sufficient conditions are proposed in terms of the model transformation technique and the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) technique. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the derived results, we give two examples including impulsive GRNs with SDD and the impulsive controller design for the nonlinear system with SDD.

Rather than minimizing the number of servers needed to serve all client requests, we aim at minimizing the total power consumed by these servers. In addition, we use the most general (and powerful) server assignment policy, where the requests of a client can be served by multiple servers located in the (unique) path from this client to the root of the tree. We consider multi-modal servers that can operate at a set of discrete speeds, using the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique. The optimization problem is to determine an optimal location of the servers in the tree, as well as the speed at which each server is operated. A major result is the NP-completeness of this problem, to be contrasted with the minimization of the number of servers, which has polynomial complexity. Another important contribution is the formulation of a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) for the problem, together with the design of several polynomial-time heuristics. We assess the efficiency of these heuristics by simulation. For mid-size instances (up to 30 nodes in the tree), we evaluate their absolute performance by comparison with the optimal solution (obtained via the MILP). The most efficient heuristics provide satisfactory results, within 20% of the optimal solution.

Along with the data transmission of primary system, a power beacon actively transfers wireless power to SS and SR. The interference from the primary data transmission can increase the amount of harvested energy at SS and SR. After harvesting and accumulating energy for a number of successive time blocks, the CR will be performed in two continuous time blocks. In CR-Block-One, SS will transmit the secondary data to SR by exhausting its available energy. In CR-Block-Two, SR will forward the secondary data to SD if it has correctly decoded the data from SS; otherwise, it will stay silent. We properly model the energy accumulation process of SS and SR by defining a group of discrete energy levels. We analyze the approximate throughputs of both systems by considering various transmit powers of SS and SR. The optimal number of time blocks used for the wireless power transfer is determined through maximizing the secondary throughput while slightly degrading the primary performance. Numerical results show that the secondary data transmission can be well accommodated.					wang, yingying/GRS-3058-2022; Li, Yujun/C-8272-2017														1932-8184	1937-9234				MAR	2021	15	1					629	640		10.1109/JSYST.2020.2991235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2020.2991235													WOS:000628985900063

This paper presents a modular, unsupervised neural network architecture which can be used for clustering and classification of complex data sets. The adaptive fuzzy leader clustering (AFLC) architecture is a hybrid neural-fuzzy system which learns on-line in a stable and efficient manner. The system uses a control structure similar to that found in the adaptive resonance theory (ART-1) network to identify the cluster centers initially. The initial classification of an input takes place in a two-stage process: a simple competitive stage and a distance metric comparison stage. The cluster prototypes are then incrementally updated by relocating the centroid positions from fuzzy C-means (FCM) system equations for the centroids and the membership values. The operational characteristics of AFLC and the critical parameters involved in its operation are discussed. The performance of the AFLC algorithm is presented through application of the algorithm to the Anderson Iris data and laser-luminescent fingerprint image data. The AFLC algorithm successfully classifies features extracted from real data, discrete or continuous, indicating the potential strength of this new clustering algorithm in analyzing complex data sets.																			1045-9227					SEP	1992	3	5					794	800		10.1109/72.159068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/72.159068								18276478					WOS:A1992JQ50600015
J	Guo, H; Chen, Y; Liu, Y				Guo, Hao; Chen, Yao; Liu, Yang			Shared autonomous vehicle management considering competition with human-driven private vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are expected to be an essential component in developing efficient and sustainable transportation systems. This paper focuses on optimizing the opera-tional decisions of SAV systems when the mode choices between SAVs and human-driven private vehicles are considered. A time-space network flow model is formulated to optimize the vehicle assignment and relocation decisions, while a binary logit model is used to describe the nonlinear relationship between the elastic demand and its various important attributes, including the trip price and the level of service. An enhanced outer-inner approximation approach is proposed for solving the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). For reducing the approximation error, a dynamic programming algorithm is developed to select the optimal breakpoints. The proposed modeling and solution approaches are tested based on a case study in Singapore. Our computational experiments show that the proposed solution approaches can efficiently obtain the optimal solutions. Numerical results reveal that a SAV system can achieve higher performance by the active relocation activities under the elastic demand. And the SAV system with a high level of service could produce a higher operating profit if users are more sensitive to the level of service.

Management of Sarcopenia: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION												Objective: This study aimed to determine the comparative effectiveness of interventions in treatment of sarcopenia. The primary outcome was the measure of treatment effect on muscle mass, and secondary outcomes were the treatment effect on muscle strength and physical performance. Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). Setting and Participants: Participants with sarcopenia receiving interventions targeting sarcopenia in any setting. Methods: Data sources: Relevant RCTs were identified by a systematic search of several electronic databases, including CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from January 1995 to July 2019. Duplicate title and abstract and full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed. Data extraction: All RCTs examining sarcopenia interventions [mixed exercise (combined aerobic and resistance exercise), aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, balance exercise, physical activity and protein or nutrition supplementation, acupuncture, whole-body vibration, protein supplement or interventions to increase protein intake, any nutritional intervention other than protein, and pharmacotherapy] were included. Comparators were standard care, placebo, or another intervention. Data synthesis: We performed Bayesian NMA; continuous outcome data were pooled using the standardized mean difference effect size. Interventions were ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for each outcome. Results: A total of 59 RCTs were included after screening of 4315 citations and 313 full-text articles. Network meta-analysis of muscle mass outcome (including 46 RCTs, 3649 participants, 11 interventions) suggested that mixed exercise were the most effective intervention (SUCRA = 93.94%) to increase muscle mass. Physical activity and protein or nutrition supplementation, and aerobic exercise were the most effective interventions to improve muscle strength and physical performance, respectively. Overall, mixed exercise is the most effective intervention in increasing muscle mass and was one of the 3 most effective interventions in increasing muscle strength and physical performance. Conclusions and Implications: Mixed exercise and physical activity with nutritional supplementation are the most effective sarcopenia interventions. Most of the included studies have a high risk of bias. More robust RCTs are needed to increase the confidence of our NMA results and the quality of evidence.

Learning in continuous action space for developing high dimensional potential energy models	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Reinforcement learning algorithms are emerging as powerful machine learning approaches. This paper introduces a novel machine-learning approach for learning in continuous action space and applies this strategy to the generation of high dimensional potential models for a wide variety of materials. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that combine a tree search with deep learning have found remarkable success in searching exorbitantly large, albeit discrete action spaces, as in chess, Shogi and Go. Many real-world materials discovery and design applications, however, involve multi-dimensional search problems and learning domains that have continuous action spaces. Exploring high-dimensional potential energy models of materials is an example. Traditionally, these searches are time consuming (often several years for a single bulk system) and driven by human intuition and/or expertise and more recently by global/local optimization searches that have issues with convergence and/or do not scale well with the search dimensionality. Here, in a departure from discrete action and other gradient-based approaches, we introduce a RL strategy based on decision trees that incorporates modified rewards for improved exploration, efficient sampling during playouts and a "window scaling scheme" for enhanced exploitation, to enable efficient and scalable search for continuous action space problems. Using high-dimensional artificial landscapes and control RL problems, we successfully benchmark our approach against popular global optimization schemes and state of the art policy gradient methods, respectively. We demonstrate its efficacy to parameterize potential models (physics based and high-dimensional neural networks) for 54 different elemental systems across the periodic table as well as alloys. We analyze error trends across different elements in the latent space and trace their origin to elemental structural diversity and the smoothness of the element energy surface. Broadly, our RL strategy will be applicable to many other physical science problems involving search over continuous action spaces.

Mosaddek			A particle swarm inspired approach for continuous distributed constraint optimization problems	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE												Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are a widely studied framework for coordinating in-teractions in cooperative multi-agent systems. In classical DCOPs, variables owned by agents are assumed to be discrete. However, in many applications, such as target tracking or sleep scheduling in sensor networks, continuous-valued variables are more suitable than discrete ones. To better model such applications, researchers have proposed Continuous DCOPs (C-DCOPs), an extension of DCOPs, that can explicitly model problems with continuous variables. The state-of-the-art approaches for solving C-DCOPs experience either onerous memory or computation overhead and are unsuitable for non-differentiable optimization problems. To address this issue, we propose a new C-DCOP algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization Based C-DCOP (PCD), which is inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a well-known centralized population -based approach for solving continuous optimization problems. In recent years, population-based algorithms have gained significant attention in classical DCOPs due to their ability in producing high-quality solutions. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, this class of algorithms has not been utilized to solve C-DCOPs and there has been no work evaluating the potential of PSO in solving classical DCOPs or C-DCOPs. In light of this observation, we adapted PSO, a centralized algorithm, to solve C-DCOPs in a decentralized manner. The resulting PCD algorithm not only produces good-quality solutions but also finds solution without any requirement for derivative calculations. Moreover, we design a crossover operator that can be used by PCD to further improve the quality of solutions found. Finally, we theoretically prove that PCD is an anytime algorithm and empirically evaluate PCD against the state-of-the-art C-DCOP algorithms in a wide variety of benchmarks.

A methodological approach to the determination of optimal parameters of district heating systems with several heat sources	ENERGY												The determination of optimal parameters is of great importance to ensure the operability of a district heating system. Solving this problem entails providing the necessary network transmission capacity by determining pipe diameters, sites and parameters of pumping stations. The Melentiev Energy Systems Institute of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences has proposed methods to solve problem. A significant feature of these methods lies in that they make it possible to use complex mathematical models of the equipment used and flexibly adjust the computational procedure to the specific features of the system to be modelled. Normally, district heating systems have several heat sources. The practical problems for such systems have been solved by a technique based on the decomposition of the model of a district heating system according to heat source service areas. The decomposition breaks the unity of the computational process. As a result, the solution obtained is not optimal for the original district heating system model. The paper presents a methodological approach to determining optimal parameters of district heating systems with several heat sources. The approach employs a modified dynamic programming optimization method that provides an optimal solution without decomposition into the heat source service areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Though impressive progress has been recently made, diverse semantic synthesis that can efficiently produce semantic-level or even instance-level multimodal results, still remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a novel diverse semantic image synthesis framework from the perspective of semantic class distributions, which naturally supports diverse generation at both semantics and instance level. We achieve this by modeling class-level conditional modulation parameters as continuous probability distributions instead of discrete values, and sampling per-instance modulation parameters through instance-adaptive stochastic sampling that is consistent across the network. Moreover, we propose prior noise remapping, through linear perturbation parameters encoded from paired references, to facilitate supervised training and exemplar-based instance style control at test time. To further extend the user interaction function of the proposed method, we also introduce sketches into the network. In addition, specially designed generator modules, Progressive Growing Module and Multi-Scale Refinement Module, can be used as a general module to improve the performance of complex scene generation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that our method can achieve superior diversity and comparable quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The challenge is the formal modeling of the problem that intrinsically requires discrete and continuous computation, e.g. grouping people vs. predicting 3d pose. The model identifies human body structures (joints and limbs) in images, groups them based on 2d and 3d information fused using learned scoring functions, and optimally aggregates such responses into partial or complete 3d human skeleton hypotheses under kinematic tree constraints, but without knowing in advance the number of people in the scene and their visibility relations. We design a multi-task deep neural network with differentiable stages where the person grouping problem is formulated as an integer program based on learned body part scores parameterized by both 2d and 3d information. This avoids suboptimality resulting from separate 2d and 3d reasoning, with grouping performed based on the combined representation. The final stage of 3d pose and shape prediction is based on a learned attention process where information from different human body parts is optimally integrated. State-of-the-art results are obtained in large scale datasets like Human3.6M and Panoptic, and qualitatively by reconstructing the 3d shape and pose of multiple people, under occlusion, in difficult monocular images.

To improve energy efficiency, we design a hybrid relaying communication strategy in which wireless relays are allowed to operate in either the passive mode via backscatter communications or the active mode via RF communications, depending on their channel conditions and energy states. We aim to maximize the overall SNR by jointly optimizing the access point's beamforming strategy as well as individual relays' radio modes and operating parameters. Due to the non-convex and combinatorial structure of the SNR maximization problem, we develop a deep reinforcement learning approach that adapts the beamforming and relaying strategies dynamically. In particular, we propose a novel optimization-driven hierarchical deep deterministic policy gradient (H-DDPG) approach that integrates the model-based optimization into the framework of conventional DDPG approach. It decomposes the discrete relay mode selection into the outer-loop by using deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm and then optimizes the continuous beamforming and relays' operating parameters by using the inner-loop DDPG algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the H-DDPG is robust to the hyper parameters and can speed up the learning process compared to the conventional DDPG approach.

This representation is commonly used for obstacle avoidance and mapping. Here, we propose a new approach for using point clouds for another critical robotic capability, semantic understanding of the environment (i.e., object classification). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that perform extremely well for object classification in 2-D images, are not easily extendible to 3-D point clouds analysis. It is not straightforward due to point clouds' irregular format and a varying number of points. The common solution of transforming the point cloud data into a 3-D voxel grid needs to address severe accuracy versus memory size tradeoffs. In this letter, we propose a novel, intuitively interpretable, 3-D point cloud representation called 3-D modified Fisher vectors. Our representation is hybrid as it combines a coarse discrete grid structure with continuous generalized Fisher vectors. Using the grid enables us to design a new CNN architecture for real-time point cloud classification. In a series of performance analysis experiments, we demonstrate competitive results or even better than state of the art on challenging benchmark datasets while maintaining robustness to various data corruptions.

Three theorems of shape formation problem with three agents are addressed by the Lagrangian multiplier method, however, the Lagrangian multiplier method difficultly solves optimal shape formation problem where the number of agents is strictly larger than 3 and the number of constraints is larger than 2. In order to tackle the continuous and discrete optimization problem, the continuous-discrete particle swarm optimization (CDPSO) algorithm is developed to search for the rotated angle of the desired shape and the matching pair between points in the initial shape and points in the desired shape. Additionally, the parameters in CDPSO algorithm are set by three theorems on convergence analysis of the random PSO algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the CDPSO algorithm on the shape formation problem, numerical results not only discuss the optimal virtual helicopters formation between two typical shapes in the three dimensional space, but also provide one searching and rescuing strategy of MH370 plane to minimize the whole moving distance of all virtual rescuing ships. Moreover, the shape conversion problem including multiple agents is also solved by the CDPSO algorithm when the number of agents is equal to 100, 200, 500 and 1000. Additionally, the optimization results and the computational time are compared among the Lagrange multiplier method, CDPSO, CDDE, CDGA, CDPSOI and CDPSOE algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the integration leads to a mixed-integer dynamic optimization problem, which could be challenging to solve. We propose two efficient methods based on the generalized Bender decomposition framework that take advantage of the special structures of the integrated problem. The first method is applied to a time-slot formulation. The decomposed primal problem is a set of separable dynamic optimization problems and the master problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear fractional program. The master problem is then solved to global optimality by a fractional programming algorithm, ensuring valid Benders cuts. The second decomposition method is applied to a production sequence formulation. Similar to the first method, the second method uses a fractional programming algorithm to solve the master problem. Compared with the simultaneous method, the proposed decomposition methods can reduce the computational time by over two orders of magnitudes for a polymer production process in a CSTR.

Research has begun to study such networks in an effort to maximize efficiency and to improve operations. Previous work focused on developing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with an aim of determining the optimal location and capacity of important nodes of the RL network, such as inspection centers and remanufacturing facilities. Transportation decisions, such as whether to use in-house or outsourced vehicles, are often based on cost effectiveness. The problem is formulated for the case of a household appliance in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Sixty-eight cities are considered, leading to a very large number of variables and constraints; thus, a heuristic approach, namely a Genetic Algorithm (GA), is chosen to solve the problem. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a very efficient GA capable of solving a large scale problem in short time. The developed GA was capable of solving a very large problem (with 656,885 continuous variables, 2040 binary variables, 10 integer variables, and 100,340 constraints) with a gap of 0.3% and about 38.5 times faster than GAMS using a personal computer. The same GA succeeded to solve both large and small problems to optimality or with a gap that didn't exceed 1.5% and faster than GAMS. The technique that we used to code the GA reduced the number of variables and constraints to 92% and 86%, respectively. Furthermore, the reported results provide important insights on practical aspects of the problem, as well as useful points for the evaluation of the heuristic's performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

GAS TURBINE PERFORMANCE DIGITAL TWIN FOR REAL-TIME EMBEDDED SYSTEMS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO: TURBOMACHINERY TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION, VOL 5, PT I					ASME Turbomachinery Technical Conference and Exposition (Turbo Expo)	SEP 21-25, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Int Gas Turbine Inst				This contribution reports on the development of Performance Digital Twin for industrial Small Gas Turbines. The objective of this study was the development of automation systems with control and monitoring functionalities, capable of addressing the requirements of future gas turbine plants for increased availability and reliability by use of Digital Twin technology. The project explored development of Performance Digital Twin based on Real-Time Embedded computing, which can be leveraged with Internet-of-Things (IOT) Cloud Platforms. The proposed solution was provided in a form of modular software for a range of hardware platforms, with corresponding functionalities to support advanced control, monitoring, tracking and diagnostics strategies. The developed Digital Twin was designed to be used in offline mode to assist the software commissioning process and in on-line mode to enable early detection of degradation and fault modes typical for gas path components. The Performance Digital Twin is based on a dynamic gas turbine model which was augmented with a Kalman tuner to enable performance tracking of physical assets. To support heterogeneity of gas turbine Distributed Control Systems (DCS), this project explored deployment of Digital Twin on multiple platforms. In the paper, we discuss model-based design techniques and tools specific for continuous, discrete and hybrid systems. The hybrid solution was deployed on PC-based platform and integrated with engine Distributed Control System in the field. Monitoring of gas turbine Performance Digital Twin functionalities has been established via Remote Monitoring System (STA-RMS). Assessment of deployed solution has been carried out and we present results from the field trial in this paper. The discrete solution was deployed on a range of Programable Logical Controller (PLC) platforms and has been tested by integrating Digital Twin in virtual engine Distributed Control System network. The Performance Digital Twin was embedded in Single Master PLC and Master-Slave PLC configurations, and we present results from the system testing using virtual gas turbine assets. The IoT Platform MindSphere was integrated within virtual engine network, and in this contribution, we explore expansion of the developed system with Cloud based applications and services.																					978-0-7918-8414-0				2020									V005T05A010															WOS:001232604600010

The proposed auto shutdown comparator is further employed to realize a compact, ultralow power continuous-time Delta Sigma modulator (CTDSM) with a 300-mV supply voltage for multichannel sensing and biomedical applications. The design was fabricated in standard mixed-mode 180-nm CMOS process. Measurement results show that the CTDSM achieves a peak SNDR of 54.81 dB and DR of 57.4 dB while consuming a core power of 1.76 mu W at 300-mV supply voltage without the clock-gated comparator. With the clock-gated auto shutdown comparator, the CTDSM consumes a core power of only 220 nW thereby providing an eight times power saving. Moreover, the fabricated CTDSM occupies an extremely small area of 0.0464 mm(2) with an energy efficiency of 24.5 fJ/conv making it the most compact and energy-efficient CTDSM reported till date among the moderate resolution CTDSMs. Furthermore, by increasing the supply voltage to 400 mV, the CTDSM features a peak SNDR of 58.56 dB and DR of 64.1 dB while consuming a core power of 410 nW and 29.61 fJ/conv.

J	Poh, KL; Choo, KW; Wong, CG				Poh, KL; Choo, KW; Wong, CG			A heuristic approach to the multi-period multi-commodity transportation problem	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY												This paper describes an approach to solving a real-world problem which involves the transportation of multiple types of commodities from a number of sources to a number of destinations in discrete time periods, using a capacitated heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. The preliminary objective is to minimize the total number of discrete periods needed to complete the entire operation. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer programme and its tractability is then greatly improved by reformulating it through backward decomposition into two separate models and solved iteratively. A heuristic approach harnessing specific features of the second approach is developed for solving large size problems to obtain near-optimal solutions within reasonable time. The design of the heuristic also takes into consideration the secondary objectives of minimizing the total vehicle capacity used and minimizing the total capacity of sources needed to satisfy the demands at the destinations. Computational results are provided for a variety of randomly generated problems as well as problems from the literature. The approach described here may be applied to the multi-period transportation of personnel and goods from multiple starting points to multiple destinations in both military and civilian applications.																			0160-5682	1476-9360				JUN	2005	56	6					708	718		10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601875	http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601875													WOS:000229140300009

Distinct characteristics arise within the different airburst signatures because high explosive warheads emphasize concussive and shrapnel effects, while chemical/biological warheads are designed to disperse their contents over large areas, therefore employing a slower burning, less intense explosive to mix and spread their contents. The ensuing blast waves are readily characterized by variations in the corresponding peak pressure and rise time of the blast, differences in the ratio of positive pressure amplitude to the negative amplitude, and variations in the overall duration of the resulting waveform. Unique attributes can also be identified that depend upon the properties of the gun tube, projectile speed at the muzzle, and the explosive burn rates of the warhead. In this work, the discrete wavelet transform is used to extract the predominant components of these characteristics from air burst signatures at ranges exceeding 2km. Highly reliable discrimination is achieved with a feedforward neural network classifier trained on a feature space derived from the distribution of wavelet coefficients and higher frequency details found within different levels of the multiresolution decomposition.																			0277-786X		0-8194-5803-1				2005	5818						85	95		10.1117/12.603648	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.603648													WOS:000229698000009

These conditions restrict the elongations of bars and are analogous to the compatibility conditions of deformation in continuum mechanics. Two problems are considered: the discrete problem for structures with prescribed lengths and its linearization, the discrete problem of prescribed elongations. These problems approximate two continuum problems, the nonlinear continuum problem of given Cauchy Green tensor and its linearization, the continuum problem of prescribed strain. The requirement that the deformations remain planar imposes solvability conditions of all four problems. For triangulated structures, compatibility conditions for the nonlinear problem are expressed as a polynomial equation in the lengths of edges of the star domain surrounding each interior node. In the linearized discrete problem, the compatibility conditions become linear relations for the elongations of edges on the same domains. The continuum limits of the compatibility conditions for both discrete problems are proved to be the compatibility conditions for the continuum problems. The compatibility equations may be summed along a closed curve to give conditions supported on a strip along the curve. Similarly, for continuous materials, the compatibility equation for the prescribed strain problem may be integrated along a closed curve to provide an integral condition, analogous to how the prescribed Green tensor problem may be integrated to give the Gauss-Bonnet integral formula. Compatibility conditions are investigated for general trusses such as plates connected by girders or triangulated domains with holes or missing edges. Compatibility conditions on general trusses may be non-local. There may be rigid trusses without compatibility conditions in contrast to continuous materials. The number of compatibility conditions is the number of bars that may be removed from a structure and still keep it rigid. This number measures the resilience of the structure. The compatibility equations around a hole involve the edges in the neighborhood surrounding the hole. An asymptotic density of compatibility conditions for periodically damaged triangular structures is found to be sensitive to the number and location of the removed edges. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The study focuses on the principles for designing and installing a generic hub facility so that the results can be considered at other sites. The prefeasibility study found that design pressures of 7 and 15 bar are feasible transport conditions; moreover, it showed that economies of scale might reduce the total cost for a CO2 network. It is recognised that cooperation across the chain is crucial in managing impurities due to the likely diverse sources of CO2. An intermediate storage facility can support the continuous supply of CO2 via a pipeline system for reservoir injection, improving the integrity of the injection well and equipment and the reservoir performance. A mixed-integer linear programming optimisation model has been developed for sizing and costing intermediate storage hubs of CO2 in Grenland and shipping connections between them and stationary emitters. The model considers an aggregated flow of 2 million tonnes per annum of CO2 for 30 years. The 7 bar design pressure has shown lower total costs when compared with the 15 bar scenario. This is due to the higher costs for shipping and intermediate storage when operating at higher pressure, which is larger than the cost reduction from liquefying CO2 to a higher pressure and higher temperature than those required for a 7 bar scenario. The estimated levelised costs were 21,6 (sic) tonne(-1) at 7 bar pressure and 27,8 (sic) tonne(-1) at 15 bar pressure.																			1750-5836	1878-0148				DEC	2021	112								103514	10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103514		NOV 2021											WOS:000730088500001

J	Pedrycz, W; Sosnowski, ZA				Pedrycz, W; Sosnowski, ZA			Genetically optimized fuzzy decision trees	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS												In this study, we are concerned with genetically optimized fuzzy decision trees (G-DTs). Decision trees are fundamental architectures of machine learning, pattern recognition, and system modeling. Starting with the generic decision tree with discrete or interval-valued attributes, we develop its fuzzy set-based generalization. In this generalized structure we admit the values of the attributes that are represented by some membership functions. Such fuzzy decision trees are constructed in the setting of genetic optimization. The underlying genetic algorithm optimizes the parameters of the fuzzy sets associated with the individual nodes where they play a role of fuzzy "switches" by distributing a flow of processing completed within the tree. We discuss various forms of the fitness function that help capture the essence of the problem at hand (that could be either of classification nature when dealing with discrete outputs or regression-like when handling a continuous output variable). We quantify a nature of the generalization of the tree by studying an optimally adjusted spreads of the membership functions located at the nodes of the decision tree. A series of experiments exploiting synthetic and machine learning data is used to illustrate the performance of the G-DTs.

J	Wu, ZH; Hsieh, SJ; Li, JZ				Wu, Zhenhua; Hsieh, Sheng-Jen; Li, Jianzhi			Sensor deployment based on fuzzy graph considering heterogeneity and multiple-objectives to diagnose manufacturing system	ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING												In this paper, a methodology is presented to generate an optimized sensor deployment deciding sensor types, numbers, and locations to accurately monitor fault signatures in manufacturing systems. Sensor deployment to robustly monitor operation parameters is the corner stone for diagnosing manufacturing systems. However, current literature lacks investigation in methodologies that handle heterogeneity among sensor properties and consider multiple-objective optimization involved in the sensor deployment. We propose a quantitative fuzzy graph based approach to model the cause-effect relationship between system faults and sensor measurements; analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to aggregate the heterogeneous properties of the sensor-fault relationship into single edge values in fuzzy graph, thus quantitatively determining the sensor's detectability to fault. Finally sensor-fault matching algorithms were proposed to minimize fault unobservability and cost for the whole system, under the constraints of detectability and limited resources, thus achieving optimum sensor placement. The performance of the proposed strategy was tested and validated on different manufacturing systems (continuous or discrete); various issues discussed in the methodology were demonstrated in the case studies. In the continuous manufacturing case study, the results illustrated that compared with signed directed graph (SDG), the proposed fuzzy graph based methodology can greatly enhance the detectability to faults (from SDG's 0.699 to fuzzy graph's 0.772). In the discrete manufacturing case study, results from different optimization approaches were compared and discussed; the detectability of sensors to faults also increased from SDG's 0.61 to fuzzy graph's 0.65. The two case study results show that the proposed approach overcame the qualitative approach such as signed directed graph's deficiency on handling sensor heterogeneity and multiple objectives; the proposed approach is systematic and robust; it can be integrated into diagnosis architecture to detect faults in other complex systems.

A completed experimental investigation is adopted for the current study, and a research plan is employed. Three different superplasticizers amount (SP), different SF replacement ratios, and a constant amount of SFb were used by the weight of cement to meet the C25 target strength. A sum of 16 distinct mixtures designed by changing SP and SF ratios were developed. Furthermore, SFb was added at a fixed rate of 65 kg/m(3) to all planned concrete mixes. In addition, SFb was used to create a 16-mix design. Finally, a total of 32 distinct mix designs were created. Produced, hardened specimens were exposed to two different curing conditions. This research uses the mechanical characteristics of concrete treated with SF, SP, and SFb to estimate by conducting standalone and hybridized generalized extreme learning machine (GRELM) algorithms based on available experimental data in terms of the metaheuristic aspects of this work. With continuous input data, four separate data sets were constructed. Compressive strength and flexural strength were estimated separately. With the aid of the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms, binary and ternary hybrid approaches were developed and tested on the data. Four distinct estimation models were suggested. Two quality metrics were used to evaluate the estimation performance: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and correlation of determination (R-2). The estimation results showed that the hybridized GRELM-PSO-GWO estimation model that was built for prediction was relatively successful in all sets.																			2228-6160	2364-1843				JUN	2023	47	3					1357	1377		10.1007/s40996-022-01005-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40996-022-01005-6		DEC 2022											WOS:000912868900001
J	Janssen, V; Roberts, C; Rizos, C; Abidin, HZ				Janssen, V; Roberts, C; Rizos, C; Abidin, HZ			Low-cost GPS-based volcano deformation monitoring at Mt. Papandayan, Indonesia	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The global positioning system (GPS) can be utilised to detect ground deformations of the surface of a volcano. Ground deformation monitoring is considered one of the most effective tools for investigating the behaviour of active volcanoes. The decreasing cost of GPS hardware, together with the increased reliability of the technology, facilitates such demanding applications. GPS ground deformation measurements can be continuous, automatic, conducted in all weather conditions, and provide three-dimensional positioning results. Higher computing power also means that the complex mathematics required to process GPS baselines can be easily handled in near real time. During the past few years a methodology has been developed for processing data collected by GPS networks consisting of a mixed set of single-frequency and dual-frequency receivers. The strategy is to deploy a few permanent, 'fiducial' GPS stations with dual-frequency, geodetic-grade receivers surrounding an 'inner' network of low-cost, single-frequency GPS receivers. Such a configuration offers considerable flexibility and cost savings for geodynamic applications such as volcano deformation monitoring, which require a dense spatial coverage of GPS stations, and where it is not possible to establish permanent GPS networks using only expensive dual-frequency instrumentation. This configuration has recently been tested at the Mt. Papandayan volcano in West Java, Indonesia. The two-stage network design consists of an inner network of four single-frequency Canadian Marconi (CM) GPS receivers surrounded by three dual-frequency Leica CRS1000 GPS receivers. The inner network logged and transmitted GPS data from the 'slave' stations located on the volcano, to a base station. The combined processing of the CM and Leica receiver data was performed off-line so as to investigate the performance of such a mixed-mode system. The basis of the processing methodology is to separate the dual-frequency, 'fiducial' station data processing from the baseline processing involving the single-frequency receivers on the volcano. The data processing for the former was carried out using a modified version of the Bernese software, to generate a file of 'corrections' (analogous to Wide Area DGPS correction models for the distance dependent biases - primarily due to atmospheric refraction). These 'corrections' were then applied to the double-differenced phase observations from the inner receivers to improve the baseline accuracies. A description of the field testing (and its challenges) during February-March 2000, together with a discussion of some of the results are presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	You, J; Feng, HJ; Chen, LG; Xie, ZH				You, Jiang; Feng, Huijun; Chen, Lingen; Xie, Zhihui			Constructal design of nonuniform heat generating area based on triangular elements: A case of entropy generation minimization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES												This paper reports a constructal investigation of heat transfer in a nonuniform heat generating triangular area, and numerically studies the entropy generation performance over the area inserted with constant and discrete variable cross-sectional high conductive channels (HCCs), respectively. The effects of the nonuniform heat generating (NUHG) coefficient and width coefficient on the overall thermal performance are also analyzed with several conditions of heat distributions. This model has two constraints: the area ratio of HCCs to the whole heat generating area and the global heat generation (the heat is nonuniformly distributed over the area). The structure of the HCCs is free to morph in order to present a better thermal performance. The numerical results show that for an elemental triangle, the optimal structure tends to elongate as the NUHG coefficient increases. It is also indicated that the dimensionless entropy generation rate for the first-order construct constituting of six elements is decreased by 20.0% in comparison with the counterpart constituting of four elements, which means that increasing the number of incorporated elements makes it favorable to improve the overall thermal performance. Additionally, the quartic minimized dimensionless entropy generation rate of the first-order construct with discrete cross-sectional HCCs performs 14.2% better than the counterpart with constant highly conductive routes. In this context, the thermal performance can be improved reasonably by intruding the variable cross-sectional architecture into the heat generating area. In general, the effects of the nonuniform heat generating coefficient p, width coefficient m and the number of triangular elements n on the overall thermal performance are studied. The pivotal innovation of this paper is introducing entropy generation minimization theory into the constructal design of triangular assemblies with both nonuniform heat generation and discrete variable cross-sectional HCCs, which can contribute to the design of practical electronic devices to a promising heat transfer performance.

Thus, formulation optimization is a key component of technological innovation in the field of CBFs. From this perspective, a series of experiments were designed to prepare a type of CBF using two natural forms of basalt. The average tensile strength of the fabricated CBF was 4111 MPa. Moreover, it is found that the amount of glass network modifier (Na2O + K2O) has a negative correlation with the tensile strength of CBF. By combining our results with past studies, two empirical formulas were proposed to quantify the relationship between viscosity (eta) and viscosity modulus (M eta) for basalt melts at 1300 degrees C and 1400 degrees C:eta(1300 degrees C) -91.22971 + 16.06614e(1.25983M1) and eta(1400 degrees C) -30.57462 + 6.32023 e(1.18491 M eta). It was found that a value of M eta ranging between 2.2 and 2.6 is optimum for CBF production. We also established an important correlation between m Mu and mix compositions, which could be an essential criterion to evaluate the characteristics and production technology of CBF, including basalt beneficiation and formulation optimization.																			0272-8842	1873-3956				MAY 1	2021	47	9					12410	12415		10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.01.097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.01.097		MAR 2021											WOS:000632852900002

Admission control and power allocation are embedded in the precoding vector selection procedure. The objective is to maximize the system utility, defined as the revenue gained from admitting users minus the cost for the transmitted power of the base station. We adopt the quality-of-service constrained approach and the robustness against channel covariance estimation errors is realized with worst-case design. The robust codebook-based beamforming problem, which is a hi-level mixed integer program, is converted into a more tractable mixed integer second-order cone program. Techniques are proposed to customize the convex continuous relaxation based branch-and-cut algorithm to compute the optimal solutions. A low-complexity inflation procedure is also developed to compute the near-optimal solutions for practical applications. Numerical examples show that the gap between the average number of admitted users achieved by the fast inflation procedure and that of the optimal solutions is less than 11.6% for all considered simulation settings. Further, the inflation procedure yields optimal solutions in 88% of the Monte Carlo runs under specific parameter settings.

PLOS ONE												The brain's ability to synchronize movements with external cues is used daily, yet neuroscience is far from a full understanding of the brain mechanisms that facilitate and set behavioral limits on these sequential performances. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was designed to help understand the neural basis of behavioral performance differences on a synchronizing movement task during increasing (acceleration) and decreasing (deceleration) metronome rates. In the MRI scanner, subjects were instructed to tap their right index finger on a response box in synchrony to visual cues presented on a display screen. The tapping rate varied either continuously or in discrete steps ranging from 0.5 Hz to 3 Hz. Subjects were able to synchronize better during continuously accelerating rhythms than in continuously or discretely decelerating rhythms. The fMRI data revealed that the precuneus was activated more during continuous deceleration than during acceleration with the hysteresis effect significant at rhythm rates above 1 Hz. From the behavioral data, two performance measures, tapping rate and synchrony index, were derived to further analyze the relative brain activity during acceleration and deceleration of rhythms. Tapping rate was associated with a greater brain activity during deceleration in the cerebellum, superior temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. Synchrony index was associated with a greater activity during the continuous acceleration phase than during the continuous deceleration or discrete acceleration phases in a distributed network of regions including the prefrontal cortex and precuneus. These results indicate that the brain's inertia for movement is different for acceleration and deceleration, which may have implications in understanding the origin of our perceptual and behavioral limits.

J	Park, S; Lee, SY; Park, KM; Lee, SS				Park, Sunhong; Lee, So Young; Park, Ki-Min; Lee, Shim Sung			Supramolecular Networking of Macrocycles Based on Exo-Coordination: From Discrete to Continuous Frameworks	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH												Macrocyclic ligands typically show high selectivity for specific metal ions and small molecules, and these features make such molecules attractive candidates for nanoscale chemical sensing applications. Crown ethers are macrocydic structures with polyether linkages where the oxygen donors are often separated by an ethylene unit (-O-CH2-CH2-O-). Because the oxygen lone pairs in crown-type macrocycles are directed inward, the preorganized macrocyclic cavity tends to form complexes where metals coordinate inside the cavity (endo-coordination). However, sulfur-containing macrocycles often demonstrate metal coordination outside of the cavity (exo-coordination). This coordination behavior results from the different torsion arrangements adopted by the X-CH2-CH2-X atom sequence (X = O, gauche; X = S, anti) In these molecules. Exo-coordination is synthetically attractive because it would provide a means of connecting macrocyclic building blocks in diverse arrangements. In fact, exo-coordination could allow the construction of more elaborate network assemblies than are possible using conventional endocyclic coordination (which gives metal-in-cavity products). Exo-coordination can also serve as a tool for crystal engineering through the use of diverse controlling factors. Although challenges remain in the development of exo-coordination-based synthetic approaches and, in particular, for the architectural control of supramolecular coordination platforms, we have established several strategies for the rational synthesis of new metallosupramolecules. In this Account, we describe our recent studies of the assembly of metallosupramolecules and coordination polymers based on sulfur-containing macrocycles that employ simple and versatile exo-coordination procedures. Initially, we focus on the unusual topological products such as sandwich (1:2, metal-to-ligand), club sandwich (2:3), and cyclic oligomeric complexes as discrete network systems. The primary structures we achieve in these networked macrocycles are one to three dimensional coordination polymers based on homo- and heteronuclear metal systems. Using crystal engineering methods, we have also investigated variation in the donors, interdonor distances, ligand isomer structures, and the effect of counter anions on the chemical and physical properties of the products. Understanding the relationship between structure and function in these exo-coordination products is an important step in the design of these new supramolecules for practical applications. We investigated the photophysical properties of the exocyclic complexes and a chromogenic macrocycle, which exhibited cation-selective and anion-controlled color change depending on an exo- or endo- ligand binding mode. Overall, we suggest that the exocyclic coordination behavior provides a versatile strategy for the preparation of new molecular networks and materials.																			0001-4842	1520-4898				MAR	2012	45	3					391	403		10.1021/ar200143n	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ar200143n								21967328					WOS:000302033000008

EFFECTS OF ZEPHYR PARTICLE LENGTH AND ORDINARY CHIP ADMIXTURE ON THE BENDING PROPERTIES OF BOARDS	MOKUZAI GAKKAISHI												This study was designed to utilize 'Zephyr' as the basic element in the production of particleboard. This first part of the study focused on the determination and evaluation of the effects of 'Zephyr' particle length and ordinary chip mixing ratio on the bending properties (modulus of rupture, MOR and modulus of elasticity, MOE) of the boards. Results are summarized as follows: 1) Boards made of 40 mm long 'Zephyr' particles yield larger MOR and MOE than those with 20 mm long particles. Beyond a length of 40 mm, that is, 60 or 80 mm, there were only slight differences in these properties. 2) At the same board density, boards made from the combination of 'Zephyr' particles and ordinary chips had better bending properties than boards in pure form (pure ordinary chips or pure 'Zephyr' particles). As in the case when the MOR and MOE of the boards were plotted as functions of chip mixing ratio, maximum curves were obtained. 3) Increasing the amount of ordinary chips (or 'Zephyr' particles) added to 'Zephyr' particles (or ordinary chips) improved the bending properties of the boards due to increased board density. Moreover, beyond a board density of 0.56 g/cm3, results indicated the mixing effects on these properties.																			0021-4795	1880-7577					1991	37	5					441	448																WOS:A1991FV52700008
J	CRYAN, RA; UNWIN, RT				CRYAN, RA; UNWIN, RT			OPTIMAL AND SUBOPTIMAL DETECTION OF OPTICAL-FIBER DIGITAL PPM	IEE PROCEEDINGS-J OPTOELECTRONICS												The discrete time modulation format, known as digital PPM, has been used to exchange channel bandwidth for improved signal-to-noise ratio in optical communication systems. However, the filter that optimises signal detection is complex in that it comprises a prewhitened matched filter in cascade with a proportional-derivative-delay network. In this form, the receiver would be unrealistic for a commercial system. This paper examines the use of both optimum and suboptimum detection. Three suboptimum predetection filters are considered: a matched filter, an optimised three-pole filter and a third-order Butter-worth filter. Original receiver sensitivity calculations, carried out at a bit rate of 140 Mbit/s and a wavelength of 1.3 mum, show that the optimum digital PPM system offers an 8.6 dB improvement over a typical PCM system. The suboptimum predetection filters result in sensitivity degradations of 0.4, 0.9 and 1.1 dB, respectively. This clearly illustrates that receiver complexity can be simplified without large reductions in sensitivity. In particular, the well known and simple Butterworth filter can be employed with only 1.1 dB degradation in sensitivity.																			0267-3932					DEC	1993	140	6					367	375		10.1049/ip-j.1993.0057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/ip-j.1993.0057													WOS:A1993MP46400004

EffCDNet: Transfer learning with deep attention network for change detection in high spatial resolution satellite images	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING												High spatial resolution satellite (HRS) images are being extensively utilized for the detection of changes like urban dynamics, infrastructure surveillance, disaster management, and topographic map-making applications. The enormous information and challenging data are important for the change detection (CD) in these images. However, lack of training data and an excessive amount of information, which discourage the researcher from developing a deep-learning-based efficient algorithm for CD. Therefore we want to develop an efficient algorithm in terms of accuracy and speed. Hence, we gain attention on designing an optimized Convolution Neural Network (CNN) while maintaining the speed and segmentation accuracy of the network. We develop an optimized architecture called as EffCDNet which adopts a siamese-based pre-trained encoder with an Attention-based UNet decoder for semantic segmentation. The network is built with pre-trained EfficientNet architecture with shared weights for strong feature extraction and to overcome the limitations caused by insufficient training data. The attention-based UNet decoder uses the attention-gate layer mechanism right before concatenation operation. This obtains more discriminative relevant features for improving the segmentation performance. Also, it is used for the reconstruction of fine-grained feature maps with significant use of context information. For improvement in the change map, we used the Undecimated Discrete Wavelet Transform (UDWT) fusion as a post-processing technique for spatial and temporal analysis of multi-resolution images to obtain a much more enhanced information difference map. The resulting image is less affected by noise, shift-invariable, and overcomes the mixed pixel problem to detect small possible changes. Experimental results on LEVIR-CD, SZATKI AirChange (AC), and Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) benchmark datasets proved that the proposed approach outperforms its superiority in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU) and inference time over the existing methods.

In MEC, the computational tasks are offloaded from UEs to the base station (BS) at the edge of the network for processing. However, MEC cannot cope with environments where there are no BS or where communication facilities have been destroyed. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of UAV equipped with MEC servers as a mobile base station to serve users. The problem involves user offloading decision, UAV location and allocation with computational resources, and is a hybrid optimization problem with continuous and discrete variables. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid nature-inspired optimization algorithm (HNIO) and its version for discrete optimization, where HNIO incorporates mutation and population diversity detection mechanisms to boost its global optimization capability, and we design a probabilistic selection-based coding strategy for the discrete optimization version. The experimental study is conducted based on ten cases with different numbers of UEs. Comparing HNIO with several other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, it is concluded from the Friedman and Wilcoxon's test of the experimental results that HNIO shows better precision and stability in nine out of the ten cases with higher number of UEs.					mohamed, ali Wagdy/I-2034-2012; Mohamed, Ali/HLX-3155-2023; Yang, Shengxiang/A-4176-2009	mohamed, ali Wagdy/0000-0002-5895-2632; Yang, Shengxiang/0000-0001-7222-4917; Pi, Dechang/0000-0002-6593-4563													1932-4537					SEP	2022	19	3					3264	3275		10.1109/TNSM.2022.3176829	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2022.3176829													WOS:000866556800092

We focus on Quality of Service (QoS)-guaranteed traffic for which QoS is guaranteed to individual users by restricting the number of admitted users. For this, the QoS-constrained capacity, in terms of the number of supported users, needs to be ascertained a priori. The QoS-constrained capacity is a function of users' QoS requirements, channel conditions, and radio resource allocation algorithms, which in this work is the pre-emptive priority scheduler. It is, thus, a variable quantity and mostly obtained using time-consuming offline computer simulations. Mathematical models, on the other hand, are timely and accurate, allowing the capacity to be derived in real-time as a function of the current network configuration. Existing works on mathematical modelling of pre-emptive priority schedulers have mostly focussed on single servers or multiple servers where a single server is assigned to each user. In contrast, OFDMA networks have multiple radio resources, i.e., multiple servers and each user may need more than one radio resource for a single packet transmission, i.e. it is a multi-resource system, which has been accounted for in this paper. We classify the users based on their resource requirements and model the pre-emptive priority scheduler as a multi-class, multi-server, multi-resource, non-work conserving queueing system. We derive its QoS metrics like average delay, packet drop probability, throughput, etc., from its continuous-time Markov Chain. We then use the derived QoS metrics to obtain the QoS-constrained capacity and design a threshold based predictive call admission control unit. We have validated the results using extensive discrete event simulations.

In this study we present a newly designed discrete-continuum model for simulating flow in karst systems. We use a flexible spatial discretization such that complicated conduit networks can be incorporated. Turbulent conduit flow and turbulent surface flow are described by the diffusion wave equation whereas laminar variably saturated flow in the matrix is described by the Richards equation. Transients between free-surface and pressurized conduit flow are handled by changing the capacity term of the conduit flow equation. This new approach has the advantage that the transients in mixed conduit flow regimes can be handled without the Preissmann slot approach. Conduit-matrix coupling is based on the Peaceman's well-index such that simulated exchange fluxes across the conduit-matrix interface are less sensitive to the spatial discretization. Coupling with the surface flow domain is based on numerical techniques commonly used in surface-subsurface models and storm water drainage models. Robust algorithms are used to simulate the non-linear flow processes in a coupled fashion. The model is verified and illustrated with simulation examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Instantaneous multihop connectivity of one-dimensional vehicular ad hoc networks with general distributions of communication nodes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												Connected and automated vehicle technologies hold great promises for improving the safety, efficiency, and environmental impacts of the transportation sector. In this study we are concerned with multihop connectivity of instantaneous vehicular one-dimensional ad hoc networks (VANETs) formed by connected vehicles along a communication path in a road network with given either vehicle locations or traffic densities, market penetration rates, and transmission ranges. We first define a new random variable for the location of the end node of a communication chain, which is a discrete random variable with given vehicle locations and a mixed random variable with given traffic densities. Then recursive, iterative, or differential equation models of instantaneous multihop connectivity between two communication nodes are derived from the relationships between end node probability mass or density function and connectivity. Assuming a simple communication model, the new models are applicable for general distribution patterns of vehicles and communication nodes, including non-evenly placed vehicles and nonhomogeneous Poisson distributions of nodes. With given vehicle locations, the computational cost for this new model is linear to the number of vehicles; with given traffic densities, we derive a new closed-form connectivity model for homogeneous Poisson distributions of communication nodes and an approximate closed-form model when distribution patterns of communication nodes are given by spatial renewal processes. We then apply the models to evaluate impacts on connectivity of traffic patterns, including shock waves, and road-side stations. The connectivity model could be helpful for designing routing protocols in VANETs and developing their applications in transportation systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to evaluate and demonstrate the ability of continuous firefly algorithm (CFA) to find the near optimal loading pattern, we developed CFA nodal expansion code (CFANEC) for the fuel management operation. This code consists of two main modules including CFA optimization program and a developed core analysis code implementing nodal expansion method to calculate with coarse meshes by dimensions of fuel assemblies. At first, CFA is applied for the Foxholes test case with continuous variables in order to validate CFA and then for KWU PWR using a decoding strategy for discrete variables. Results indicate the efficiency and relatively fast convergence of CFA in obtaining near optimal loading pattern with respect to considered fitness function. At last, our experience with the CFA confirms that the CFA is easy to implement and reliable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Seref, O; Fan, YJ; Chaovalitwongse, WA				Seref, Onur; Fan, Ya-Ju; Chaovalitwongse, Wanpracha Art			Mathematical Programming Formulations and Algorithms for Discrete <i>k</i>-Median Clustering of Time-Series Data	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING												Discrete k-median (DKM) clustering problems arise in many real-life applications that involve time-series data sets, in which nondiscrete clustering methods may not represent the problem domain adequately. In this study, we propose mathematical programming formulations and solution methods to efficiently solve the DKM clustering problem. We develop approximation algorithms from a bilinear formulation of the discrete k-median problem using an uncoupled bilinear program algorithm. This approximation algorithm, which we refer to as DKM-L, is composed of two alternating linear programs, where one can be solved in linear time and the other is a minimum cost assignment problem. We then modify this algorithm by replacing the assignment problem with an efficient sequential algorithm for a faster approximation, which we call DKM-S. We also propose a compact exact integer formulation, DKM-I, and a more efficient network design-based exact mixed-integer formulation, DKM-M. All of our methods use arbitrary pairwise distance matrices as input. We apply our methods to simulated single-variate and multivariate random walk time-series data. We report comparative clustering performances using normalized mutual information (NMI) and solution speeds among the DKM methods we propose. We also compare our methods to other clustering algorithms that can operate with distance matrices, such as hierarchical cluster trees (HCT) and partition around medoids (PAM). We present NMI scores and classification accuracies of our DKM algorithms compared to HCT and PAM using five different distance measures on simluated data, as well as public benchmark and real-life neural time-series data sets. We show that DKM-S is much faster than HCT, PAM, and all other DKM methods and produces consistently good clustering results on all data sets.

J	Chen, C; Kim, JK				Chen, C.; Kim, J. -K.			Optimization for intelligent operation of supply chains	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN												The schedule for manufacturing and its delivery should be strategically determined to maintain economic and sustainable management of a supply chain. However, most of existing design models for the supply chain assumes that it is known or pre-specified when products are manufactured and delivered, and therefore, only the amount of products and delivery are of interest to optimize within design frameworks. In order to provide high flexibility and cost-effectiveness in manufacturing and supply chain activities, both timing information (i.e., when to produce and deliver) and capacity (i.e., how much to produce and deliver) need to be considered simultaneously. New MILP (mixed integer linear programming) model for the design and optimization of the supply chain has been proposed, in which these two key decision variables are simultaneously optimized. For dealing with computational difficulties resulted from the large-size problem, a sequentially-updating procedure is also proposed. In this sequentially-updating procedure, the whole distribution network is divided into subsystems and optimized interactively within iterative procedure, where each subsystem is sequentially optimized until no profit improvement is observed. The enhanced flexibility of the supply chain can be obtained from this improved design philosophy. This also ensures reliable and robust responsiveness of the supply chain to customers' demand without sacrificing efficiency and/or cost-effectiveness of manufacturing and delivery activities. Illustrated case studies show that the proposed method is able to deal with large and complex supply chain problems with significant cost savings.																			0263-8762					DEC	2007	85	A12					1611	1629		10.1205/cherd07007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1205/cherd07007													WOS:000252415900006

However, for a hybrid neural network, except for the factor of discrete state observations, one always needs to consider the factors of delays and discrete mode identifications. Hence, taking delays and discrete mode identifications into account for random noises is more reasonable and practical than the original work. Motivated by the idea above, this brief is to design delayed random noises derived from discrete state observations and discrete mode identifications to almost surely exponentially stabilize an unstable hybrid recurrent neural networks, by virtue of M-matrix and stochastic analysis methods.

J	Wang, JZ; Ni, HG; He, JY				Wang, JZ; Ni, HG; He, JY			The application of automatic acquisition of knowledge to mix design of concrete	CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH												In this paper, an automatic knowledge-acquisition system based on neural networks is created to design concrete mix. This system consists of three models: the mix-design model, the slump-prediction model, and the strength-prediction model; the first model is the core of the system with the other two models supporting the core. Each model is made up of a mix-design database, a knowledge base, a neural network-learning block, and a problem solution block. The automatic acquisition of knowledge is realized through the learning process of a neural network from sample mix designs. The knowledge base is the network itself. This system not only makes full use of the workable mix designs that are already in existence but also provides a quick means to predict the slump and 28-day compressive strength of ready made concrete. Examples and experimental work show that the application of the system to concrete mix design is practicable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Interestingly, 3 and 5 were obtained simultaneously in the same reaction system. The structural differences of those complexes show the influences of the geometries of the pendant carboxylate ligands. This result also shows that intramolecular/intermolecular weak interactions play important roles in the formation of coordination architectures, especially in the aspect of linking multinuclear discrete subunits or low-dimensional entities into high-dimensional supramolecular frameworks. In addition, complexes 1, 2, and 4 exhibit blue emission in the solid state at room temperature.

A key component of this fiscal investment was funding for training and technical assistance (TA) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to newly configured Technology Transfer Centers (TTCs), including the Addiction TTCs (ATTC Network), Prevention TTCs (PTTC Network), and the Mental Health TTCs (MHTTC Network). SAMHSA charges TTCs with building the capacity of the behavioral health workforce to provide evidence-based interventions via locally and culturally responsive training and TA. This commentary describes how, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, TTCs rapidly adapted to ensure that the behavioral health workforce had continuous access to remote training and technical assistance. TTCs use a conceptual framework that differentiates among three types of technical assistance: basic, targeted, and intensive. We define each of these types of TA and provide case examples to describe novel strategies that the TTCs used to shift an entire continuum of capacity building activities to remote platforms. Examples of innovations include online listening sessions, virtual process walkthroughs, and remote "live" supervision. Ongoing evaluation is needed to determine whether virtual TA delivery is as effective as face-to-face delivery or whether a mix of virtual and face-to-face delivery is optimal. The TTCs will need to carefully balance the benefits and challenges associated with rapid virtualization of TA services to design the ideal hybrid delivery model following the pandemic.																			0740-5472					FEB	2021	121								108157	10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108157								33223379					WOS:000603350900001

However, the microstructure design and performance prediction of IPN as a function of specific C-S-H/polymer components or ingredients' parameters e.g. water to cement ratios (w/c), polymer to cement ratios (p/c), monomer components, degree of polymerization (DP), etc. is by far not available. Here we developed a mesoscale model for IPN visualization based on the Flory-Huggins interaction theory which was applied to cement science for the first time. All the ingredients in the micro-structure were considered as soluble beads with rational sizes based on their properties obtained by molecular dynamic methods. The interaction parameters of each bead were then determined based on their element ratios and chemical backbones. The model was validated with the waterborne epoxy-cement material (WECM) in which a novel waterborne epoxy resin (WEP) was prepared and impregnated. The verification results on the 2D-3D scale show that the developed model predicts the WECM's IPN structures by rule and line concerning DP, w/c, and p/c in the mixture. The C-S-H beads were progressively scaled in size which alters the C-S-H texture to have completely different dissolution characteristics. Beads of diameter similar to 6 angstrom are more unstable and soluble which enable them to form a continuous phase in water or a composite structure with WEP. In contrast, beads with diameters larger than 10 angstrom have different properties with stronger nucleation effects. The results also suggest the impregnation content of WEP in cement-based material should be limited to 10% vol. to prevent the polymer IPN from decomposing into discrete clusters. The application of Flory-Huggins theory in cement-based composites demonstrates great potential in performance prediction and microstructure design.

Existing approaches improve the resolution of HSIs by fusing multispectral image (MSI) and HSI. However, most of them are only feed-forward. They only learn low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) feature mappings without considering the ill-posedness of super-resolution tasks, leading to a large solution space of mapping functions and making it difficult to learn a complete mapping function. Moreover, there is a large resolution difference between HSI and MSI, and some up-sampling operations are inevitably employed in the network. Nevertheless, traditional upsampling methods only represent pixel points in a discrete way, failing to adequately restore the continuous spatial and spectral information. To this end, this article proposes a spatial-spectral implicit neural representation network for hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion (SS-INR). Inspired by the success of implicit neural representation (INR) in continuum reconstruction, we design spatial-INR and spectral-INR for spatial and spectral resolution reconstruction, respectively. SS-INR contains two processes: forward fusion (FF) and back-projection fusion (BPF). In the FF process, the input HSI is first spatially upsampled with spatial-INR to overcome spatial resolution differences while performing initial fusion with MSI. In the BPF process, we explore the spatial and spectral degradation processes and use them as prior knowledge for error correction. Extensive experiments on five public hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SS-INR, and SS-INR achieves competitive results compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) fusion methods.

J	Capel, MI				Capel, Manuel, I			Artificial Neuron-Based Model for a Hybrid Real-Time System: Induction Motor Case Study	MATHEMATICS												Automatic Machine Learning (AML) methods are currently considered of great interest for use in the development of cyber-physical systems. However, in practice, they present serious application problems with respect to fitness computation, overfitting, lack of scalability, and the need for an enormous amount of time for the computation of neural network hyperparameters. In this work, we have experimentally investigated the impact of continuous updating and validation of the hyperparameters, on the performance of a cyber-physical model, with four estimators based on feedforward and narx ANNs, all with the gradient descent-based optimization technique. The main objective is to demonstrate that the optimized values of the hyperparameters can be validated by simulation with MATLAB/Simulink following a mixed approach based on interleaving the updates of their values with a classical training of the ANNs without affecting their efficiency and automaticity of the proposed method. For the two relevant variables of an Induction Motor (IM), two sets of estimators have been trained from the input current and voltage data. In contrast, the training data for the speed and output electromagnetic torque of the IM have been established with the help of a new Simulink model developed entirely. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness of ANN estimators obtained with the Deep Learning Toolbox (DLT) that we used to transform the trained ANNs into blocks that can be directly used in cyber-physical models designed with Simulink.

Each particle's aerodynamic diameter is determined by measuring the delay time between two continuous-wave lasers operating at 650 nm. A Nd : YAG laser desorbs and ionizes molecules from the particle, and the time-of-flight mass spectrometer collects a mass spectrum of the generated ions. Then the composition of single particle is obtained. ALTOFMS generates large amount of data during the process period. How to process these data quickly and extract valuable information is one of the key problems for the ALTOFMS. In the present paper, an adaptive resonance theory-based neural network, ART-2a algorithm, was used to classify mixed mass spectra of aerosol particles of NaCl, CaC12, dioctylphthalate (DOP), and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). Compared with the traditional methods, ART-2a can recognize input patterns self-organically, self-adaptively and self-steadily without considering the complexity and the number of the patterns, so it is more favorable for the analysis of the mass spectra data. Experimental results show that when vigilance parameter is 0.40, learning rate is 0.05 and iteration number is 6, ART-2a algorithm can successfully reveal these four particle categories. The weight vectors for these four particle classes were obtained, which can represent the characters of these four particle classes remarkably.																			1000-0593					MAR	2009	29	3					580	584		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2009)03-0580-05	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2009)03-0580-05								19455777					WOS:000263801800002

Repositories of biodiversity data, such as GBIF, iDigBio, Atlas of Living Australia, and SNIB (Mexico's National System of Biodiversity Information), contain a great deal of information that can lead to knowledge discovery about ecosystems. However, there is a lack of tools with which to efficiently extract such knowledge. In this paper, we present SPECIES, an open, web-based platform designed to extract implicit information contained in large scale sets of ecological data. SPECIES is based on a tested methodology, wherein the correlations of variables of arbitrary type and spatial resolution, both biotic and abiotic, discrete and continuous, may be explored from both niche and network perspectives. In distinction to other modeling systems, SPECIES is a full stack exploratory tool that integrates the three basic components: data (which is incrementally growing), a statistical modeling and analysis engine, and an interactive visualization front end. Combined, these components provide a powerful tool that may guide ecologists toward new insights. SPECIES is optimized to support fast hypothesis prototyping and testing, analyzing thousands of biotic and abiotic variables, and presenting descriptive results to the user at different levels of detail. SPECIES is an open-access platform available online (), that is, powerful, flexible, and easy to use. It allows for the exploration and incorporation of ecological data and its subsequent integration into predictive models for both potential ecological niche and geographic distribution. It also provides an ecosystemic, network-based analysis that may guide the researcher in identifying relations between different biota, such as the relation between disease vectors and potential disease hosts.

J	Oni, OE; Longe, OM				Oni, Oluwafemi Emmanuel; Longe, Omowunmi Mary			Analysis of Secondary Controller on MTDC Link with Solar PV Integration for Inter-Area Power Oscillation Damping	ENERGIES												Integration of renewable energy sources is important in limiting the continuous environmental degradation and emissions caused by energy generation from fossil fuels and thus becoming a better alternative for a large-scale power mix. However, an adequate analysis of the interaction with the alternating current (AC) network during network disturbance, especially during inter-area power (IAP) oscillations is needed. Insufficient damping of oscillations can significantly impact the reliability and effective operation of a whole power system. Therefore, this paper focuses on the stability of the modified Kundur two-area four-machine (MKTAFM) system. A robust secondary controller is proposed and implemented on a line commutated converter (LCC)-based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (MTDC) system. The solution consists of a local generator controller and the LCC MTDC (LMTDC) system, voltage-dependent current order limiter, and extinction angle controller. The proposed robust controller is designed for the LMTDC systems to further dampen the inter-area power oscillations. Three operational scenarios were implemented in this study, which are the local generator controller and double circuits AC line, local generator controller with LMTDC controllers, and local generator controller with LMTDC controllers and secondary controller. The simulation result carried out on PSCAD/EMTDC recorded better damping of the inter-area power oscillation with LMTDC. A considerable improvement of 100% damping of the IAP oscillations was observed when a secondary controller was implemented on the LMTDC.

Organizational culture change in US hospitals: a mixed methods longitudinal intervention study	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE												Background: Improving outcomes for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a priority for hospital leadership, clinicians, and policymakers. Evidence suggests links between hospital organizational culture and hospital performance; however, few studies have attempted to shift organizational culture in order to improve performance, fewer have focused on patient outcomes, and none have addressed mortality for patients with AMI. We sought to address this gap through a novel longitudinal intervention study, Leadership Saves Lives (LSL). Methods: This manuscript describes the methodology of LSL, a 2-year intervention study using a concurrent mixed methods design, guided by open systems theory and the Assess, Innovate, Develop, Engage, Devolve (AIDED) model of diffusion, implemented in 10 U. S. hospitals and their peer hospital networks. The intervention has three primary components: 1) annual convenings of the ten intervention hospitals; 2) semiannual workshops with guiding coalitions at each hospital; and 3) continuous remote support across all intervention hospitals through a web-based platform. Primary outcomes include 1) shifts in key dimensions of hospital organizational culture associated with lower mortality rates for patients with AMI; 2) use of targeted evidence-based practices associated with lower mortality rates for patients with AMI; and 3) in-hospital AMI mortality. Quantitative data include annual surveys of guiding coalition members in the intervention hospitals and peer network hospitals. Qualitative data include in-person, in-depth interviews with all guiding coalition members and selective observations of key interactions in care for patients with AMI, collected at three time points. Data integration will identify patterns and major themes in change processes across all intervention hospitals over time. Conclusions: LSL is novel in its use of a longitudinal mixed methods approach in a diverse sample of hospitals, its focus on objective outcome measures of mortality, and its examination of changes not only in the intervention hospitals but also in their peer hospital networks over time. This paper adds to the methodological literature for the study of complex interventions to promote hospital organizational culture change.					curry, leslie/AAA-6100-2022; Curry, Leslie A/ABA-1890-2021; , Harlan/AAI-2875-2020	curry, leslie/0000-0002-3419-4654; Linnander, Erika/0000-0002-3417-1049													1748-5908					MAR 7	2015	10								29	10.1186/s13012-015-0218-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13012-015-0218-0								25889753					WOS:000350724300001

In order to alleviate such accumulation and blockages on the vibrating screen surface, the guide chute rotation angle of the improved variable amplitude screening mechanism was selected as the target variable, and EDEM-RecurDyn was employed to simulate the anti-blocking process of the variable amplitude under a changing feeding quantity (0.5 kg/s abnormal, 0.2 kg/s normal) of materials (rice grain and stem mixture). A BP (an error back propagation algorithm) neural network was designed and the prediction model of the material distribution was subsequently constructed on the variable screening surface under different chute angles during abnormal feeding. The results revealed a continuous decrease in the quality and time of the material blockage at the front end of the screen surface with the increasing guide chute angle. At the guide chute angle of 20 degrees-45 degrees and adjustment time of 3-6 s, the blocked and accumulated materials at the front-end screen surface was be moved back to Grid 6 for screening. However, overtime, the screen surface materials continued to move back under the chute angle of 40 degrees-45 degrees, which had a great impact on the screening performance. At the guide chute angle of 30 degrees-35 degrees and adjustment time of 4 s, the materials on the screen surface were evenly distributed in Grid 1-6. This was able to alleviate the accumulation and blockage of the screen surface materials. The R of the material distribution prediction model (BP neural network) on the screen surface was determined as 0.97, indicating the high reliability and accuracy of the material distribution model on the screen surface based on the BP neural network. This work provides an important reference for the variable amplitude intelligent control of screen surface material anti-blocking.																			1934-6344	1934-6352				JUL	2023	16	4					190	199		10.25165/j.ijabe.20231604.7178	http://dx.doi.org/10.25165/j.ijabe.20231604.7178													WOS:001089009000001

This study aims to develop a novel multi-hazard risk assessment model by applying a Hybrid Bayesian Network for agricultural water supply and distribution systems. This model consists of discrete and continuous nodes and their probable interactions. The structure of this model is designed to assess the risk associated with the agricultural water system's for supply and distribution sections separately considering various factors such as river discharge, the inflow of water distribution system and its fluctuation, and the demand of water. The developed model is applied to the Roodasht Irrigation district located in the center of Iran to demonestrate its capability. This Irrigation district is under the threat of drought, improper performance of the ditch-riders, and operational losses. The results showed that the model in both training and test datasets has proper accuracy and performance with the root mean square error of 0.069 and 0.076, coefficient of determinations equal to 0.717 and 0.690, and the overall index of model performance equal to 0.787 and 0.671, respectively. The results of this research and the proposed model will help stakeholders and decision-makers to be aware of the probable causes and the extent of system failure and its components due to the threatening hazards. Also, it will assist in planning the allocation of irrigation water based on predictable risk associated with various hazards.

Most of the existing coupling models are modeled with static networks and interface structures, in which the closed-loop data flow characteristic is not fully considered. It is difficult for these models to accurately describe spatiotemporal deduction processes, such as microgrid CPS attack identification, risk propagation, safety assessment, defense control, and cascading failure. To address this problem, a modeling method for the coupling relations of microgrid CPS driven by hybrid spatiotemporal events is proposed in the present work. First, according to the topological correlation and coupling logic of the microgrid CPS, the cyclical conversion mechanism of information flow and energy flow is analyzed, and a microgrid CPS architecture with multi-agents as the core is constructed. Next, the spatiotemporal evolution characteristic of the CPS is described by hybrid automata, and the task coordination mechanism of the multi-agent CPS terminal is designed. On this basis, a discrete-continuous correlation and terminal structure characteristic representation method of the CPS based on heterogeneous multi-groups are then proposed. Finally, four spatiotemporal events, namely state perception, network communication, intelligent decision-making, and action control, are defined. Considering the constraints of the temporal conversion of information flow and energy flow, a microgrid CPS coupling model is established, the effectiveness of which is verified by simulating false data injection attack (FDIA) scenarios.

This article presents a novel method for sleep-stage differentiation based on sonification of sleep-EEG signals using wavelet transform and recurrent neural network (RNN). Methods: Two RNNs were designed and trained separately based on a database of classical guitar pieces and Kurdish tanbur Makams using a long short-term memory model. Moreover, discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packet decomposition were used to determine the association between the EEG signals and musical pitches. Continuous wavelet transform was applied to extract musical beat-based features from the EEG. Then, the pretrained RNN was used to generate music. To test the proposed model, 11 sleep EEGs were mapped onto the guitar and tanbur frequency intervals and presented to the pretrained RNN. Next, the generated music was randomly presented to 2 neurologists. Results: The proposed model classified the sleep stages with an accuracy of >81% for tanbur and more than 93% for guitar musical pieces. The inter-rater reliability measured by Cohen's kappa coefficient (kappa) revealed good reliability for both tanbur (kappa = 0.64, p < 0.001) and guitar musical pieces (kappa = 0.85, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The present EEG sonification method leads to valid sleep staging by clinicians. The method could be used on various EEG databases for classification, differentiation, diagnosis, and treatment purposes. Real-time EEG sonification can be used as a feedback tool for replanning of neurophysiological functions for the management of many neurological and psychiatric disorders in the future.

Many researchers, vehicle manufacturers, and telecommunication industries are working on VANETS to construct the next generation transport system. In VANETS, vehicles, equipped with wireless devices, exchange the traffic-related information with other vehicles and the fixed road side units (RSUs). The information shared between vehicles and RSUs in VANETS must be secure. For secure communications in VANETS, many cryptographic schemes were proposed in different settings, and most of the schemes are using bilinear pairings over elliptic curves. But the computation of a bilinear pairing is very expensive. Also the verification of signatures/messages sent by vehicles increases the computational workload on RSUs. In order to improve computational efficiency and transmission overhead, in this paper, we present an efficient pairing-free certificateless authentication scheme with batch verification for VANETS. We designed the scheme in pairing-free environment which improves the communication and computational efficiency. The proposed scheme supports batch verification, which significantly reduces the computational workload on RSUs in VANETS. The proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model and meets the security requirements, such as authenticity, integrity, traceability, anonymity, and revocation. We compared our scheme with well-known existing schemes, and the efficiency analysis shows that the proposed scheme is more efficient.

Carbon dioxide mixing ratios are continuously monitored at 10, 48, 82, and 115 rn above the ground on a television transmitter tower, and the atmosphere/surface exchange of CO2 is measured by eddy covariance at 82 m. The region surrounding the tower is typical of rural areas of central Europe, with agricultural fields, forest patches, and small villages. We first describe the layout and the operation of the measuring system designed for the continuous, unattended monitoring: of the vertical distribution of CO2 mixing ratio in the lowest 115 m of the atmosphere based on a Li-Cor model 6251 infrared gas analyzer (IRGA). It provides vertical profile data with a temporal resolution of 8 min. Next, we discuss the measuring system for long-term, continuous monitoring of the biosphere/atmosphere exchange of CO2. The eddy correlation system is based on a Li-Cor model 6262 fast-response IRGA and a Gill ultrasonic anemometer running at 4 Hz sampling frequency. Results are to illustrate the performance of the systems. Among others, they show the occasional accumulation of CO2 in the boundary layer in the Carpathian Basin during winter and the diurnal variation of the vertical distribution of CO2 mixing ratio in summer. A simple method based on similarity theory to calculate vertical fluxes from vertical gradients is presented, which can be used to fill the data gaps that inevitably occur during long-term eddy correlation measurements. The present study confirms the feasibility of the long-term tall-tower CO2 flux and mixing ratio measurements.

Continuous/discrete geochemical monitoring of CO<sub>2</sub> Natural Analogues and of Diffuse Degassing Structures (DDS): hints for CO<sub>2</sub> storage sites geochemical monitoring protocol	GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES 9	Energy Procedia				9th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies	NOV 16-20, 2008	Washington, DC					Italy is one of the most promising prone areas to study the CO(2) behavior underground, the caprock integrity to the CO(2) leakage, mostly in presence of pervious/geochemically active faults, due to a wide availability of CO(2) rich reservoirs at a depth between 1 and 10 km, as highlighted by recent literature. These deep CO(2) reservoirs generate at least 200 leakage areas at surface throughout Italy which have been defined "Diffuse Degassing Structures" (DDS) by INGV. These are widely studied by INGV institutionally by a long term convention with the Civil Protection Department (DPC) with the aim to catalog, monitor and assess the Natural Gas Hazard (NGH, namely the probability of an area to become a site of poisonous peri - volcanic gas exhalation from soils). More than 150 researcher of INGV are involved in monitoring areas affected by the CO(2) presence underground and at surface, by continuous monitoring on-line networks (around 40 stations throughout Italy, including the Etna area, Aeolian Islands, Umbria region, Piemonte region, etc.) and discretely (9 groups of research were involved in the last years to localize, define and monitor almost all the DDSs in Italy), by sampling and analyzing chemical and isotopic compounds, useful to discriminate the origin, evolution and natural gas hazards of the examined DDS. In this paper, we will discuss some DDS catalogued and studied by a Rome INGV Research Unit (UR 11) which focused its work in Central Italy, throughout different DDS, also in relation to the diverse seismotectonic settings, to discover buried faults as possible gas leakage pathways, mostly if they are "geochemically" activated. In particular we discuss, among the discrete monitoring techniques exploited by INGV, soil gas surveying, which consists in a collection of gas samples from the soil zone not saturated (dry zone) to measure the geogas gaseous species both in fluxes (CO(2), CH(4), (222)Rn) and in concentration (He, H(2), H(2)S, helium, hydrogen, CO(2), CH4, 222Rn), that permeate the soil pores. The total CO(2) flux budget was calculated as "baseline" degassing rate of these " CO(2) analogues". A good discrete areal monitoring is prerequisite to design sound continuous monitoring network to monitor CO(2) related parameters in liquid/gas phases, to review the protocol of the Annex II of the European Directivity on CCS.

Nevertheless, the elevated Mg : Li ratio and the presence of numerous coexisting ions in salt lake brines give rise to challenges, such as prolonged lithium extraction periods, diminished lithium extraction efficiency, and considerable environmental pollution. In this work, LiFePO4 (LFP) served as the electrode material for electrochemical lithium extraction. The conductive network in the LFP electrode was optimized by adjusting the type of conductive agent. This approach resulted in high lithium extraction efficiency and extended cycle life. When the single conductive agent of acetylene black (AB) or multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was replaced with the mixed conductive agent of AB/MWCNTs, the average diffusion coefficient of Li+ in the electrode increased from 2.35 x 10(-9) or 1.77 x 10(-9) to 4.21 x 10(-9) cm(2)<middle dot>s(-1). At the current density of 20 mA<middle dot>g(-1), the average lithium extraction capacity per gram of LFP electrode increased from 30.36 mg with the single conductive agent (AB) to 35.62 mg with the mixed conductive agent (AB/MWCNTs). When the mixed conductive agent was used, the capacity retention of the electrode after 30 cycles reached 82.9%, which was considerably higher than the capacity retention of 65.8% obtained when the single AB was utilized. Meanwhile, the electrode with mixed conductive agent of AB/MWCNTs provided good cycling performance. When the conductive agent content decreased or the loading capacity increased, the electrode containing the mixed conductive agent continued to show excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, a self-designed, highly efficient, continuous lithium extraction device was constructed. The electrode utilizing the AB/MWCNT mixed conductive agent maintained excellent adsorption capacity and cycling performance in this device. This work provides a new perspective for the electrochemical extraction of lithium using LFP electrodes.																			1674-4799	1869-103X				APR	2024	31	4					678	687		10.1007/s12613-023-2750-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12613-023-2750-2													WOS:001204569700012

An emulsion gel is a gelled matrix filled with emulsion dispersion in which at least one phase, either continuous phase or dispersed phase forms spatial networks leading to the formation of a semisolid texture. Recently, the interest in the application of gels as functional colloids has attracted great attention in the food industry due to their tunable morphology and microstructure, promising physicochemical, mechanical, and functional properties, and superior stability, as well as controlled release, features for the encapsulated bioactive compounds. This article covers recent research progress on functional colloids (emulsion gels), including their fabrication, classification (protein-, polysaccharide-, and mixed emulsion gels), and properties specifically those related to the gel-body interactions (texture perception, digestion, and absorption), and industrial applications. The emerging applications, including encapsulation and controlled release, texture design and modification, fat replacement, and probiotics delivery are summarized. A summary of future perspectives to promote emulsion gels' use as functional colloids and delivery systems for scouting potential new applications in the food industry is also proposed. Emulsion gels are promising colloids being used to tailor breakdown behavior and sensory perception of food, as well as for the processing, transportation, and targeted release of food additives, functional ingredients, and bioactive substances with flexibility in designing structural and functional parameters.

To address this issue, we proposed a transactive retail market mechanism to attract the active participation of profit-driven DER retailers in a deregulated way. Considering the limited competitive property of the retail market, a bi-level DSO-dominated framework is constructed to simulate the virtual game between distribution system operator (DSO) and DER retailers. Specifically, the flexible interval pricing of retailers is modeled as a series of binary revenue constraints to influence the DSO's centralized economic dispatch decisions, where the time-varying distribution locational marginal price is adopted to settle energy activities at different locations over the time horizon. Due to the uncertain power flow path during the coordinated decision-making process, we proposed a general undirected second-order cone-based AC radial power flow model and provided sufficient conditions to ensure its exactness. Also, we applied a series of approximation and relaxation techniques to transform the bi-level mixed-integer quadratic framework with highly discrete induced domains into a solvable mixed-integer semidefinite programming problem. It is demonstrated in the case study that the proposed mechanism not only improves market efficiency but also eliminates market power and the resulting market failures.

The first and best-known part of the visual system is the retina, which is not a mere photoreceptor or static camera but a sophisticated feature preprocessor with continuous input and several parallel output channels. These interacting channels represent the visual scene. Never before has it been known in neuroscience how these channels build up a "visual language". Our mammalian retina model can generate the elements of this visual language. In the present paper the design steps of the implementation of the multilayer CNN retinal model is shown. It is rare that an analogic CNN algorithm has such a sophisticated series of different complex dynamics, meanwhile it is feasible on a recently fabricated complex cell CNN-UM chip. The mammalian retina model is decomposed into a full-custom mixed-signal chip that embeds digitally programmable analog parallel processing and distributed image memory on a common silicon substrate. The chip was designed and manufactured in a standard 0.5 mum CMOS technology and contains approximately 500,000 transistors. It consists of 1024 processing units arranged into a 32 x 32 grid. The functional features of the chip are in accordance with the second-order complex cell CNN-UM architecture: two CNN layers with programmable inter- and intra-layer connections between cells as well as programmable layer time constants. The uniqueness of this approach, among others, lies in the reprogrammability, i.e. the openness to any new discovery, even after a possible retinal implementation.

The inclusion of coupled processes in simulation models is challenged by the high aspect ratio of the fractures, the complex geometry of fracture networks, and the crucial impact of processes that completely change characteristics on the fracture-rock interface. This paper provides a general discussion of design principles for introducing fractures in simulators, and defines a framework for integrated modeling, discretization, and computer implementation. The framework is implemented in the open-source simulation software PorePy, which can serve as a flexible prototyping tool for multiphysics problems in fractured rocks. Based on a representation of the fractures and their intersections as lower-dimensional objects, we discuss data structures for mixed-dimensional grids, formulation of multiphysics problems, and discretizations that utilize existing software. We further present aPythonimplementation of these concepts in the PorePy open-source software tool, which is aimed at coupled simulation of flow and transport in three-dimensional fractured reservoirs as well as deformation of fractures and the reservoir in general. We present validation by benchmarks for flow, poroelasticity, and fracture deformation in porous media. The flexibility of the framework is then illustrated by simulations of non-linearly coupled flow and transport and of injection-driven deformation of fractures. All results can be reproduced by openly available simulation scripts.

Aiming at reducing control costs, a switching-memory-based event-trigger (SMBET) scheme, which allows a switching between the sleeping interval and the memory-based event-trigger (MBET) interval, is first presented. In consideration of the characteristics of SMBET, a piecewise-defined but continuous looped-functional is newly constructed, under which the requirement of positive definiteness and symmetry on some Lyapunov matrices is dropped within the sleeping interval. Then, a hybrid Lyapunov method (HLM), which bridges the gap between the continuous-time Lyapunov theory (CTLT) and the discrete-time Lyapunov theory (DTLT), is used to make the local stability analysis of the closed-loop system. Meanwhile, using a combination of inequality estimation techniques and the generalized sector condition, two sufficient local synchronization criteria and a codesign algorithm for the controller gain and triggering matrix are developed. Furthermore, two optimization strategies are, respectively, put forward to enlarge the estimated domain of attraction (DoA) and the allowable upper bound of sleeping intervals on the premise of ensuring local synchronization. Finally, a three-neuron neural network and the classical Chua's circuit are used to carry out some comparison analyses and to display the advantages of the designed SMBET strategy and the constructed HLM, respectively. Also, an application to image encryption is provided to substantiate the feasibility of the obtained local synchronization results.					zhang, lu/KGL-6144-2024; chen, jiayi/KHV-5520-2024; zhen, wang/KBA-3844-2024; Zhao, ZiHao/KHT-4413-2024; Shen, Hao/S-3348-2019; chen, huan/KEC-2019-2024; lin, lin/KFB-9548-2024; Wang, Zhen/AAF-8133-2019	Shen, Hao/0000-0001-7024-6573; Wang, Zhen/0000-0001-7188-5828													2162-237X	2162-2388				2023 MAY 22	2023										10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3273917	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3273917		MAY 2023						37216238					WOS:001005722100001
J	Shrestha, S; Fu, X; Hong, MY				Shrestha, Sagar; Fu, Xiao; Hong, Mingyi			Optimal Solutions for Joint Beamforming and Antenna Selection: From Branch and Bound to Graph Neural Imitation Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING												This work revisits the joint beamforming (BF) and antenna selection (AS) problem, as well as its robust beamforming (RBF) version under imperfect channel state information (CSI). Such problems arise due to various reasons, e.g., the costly nature of the radio frequency (RF) chains and energy/resource-saving considerations. The joint (R)BF&AS problem is a mixed integer and nonlinear program, and thus finding optimal solutions is often costly. The vast majority of the prior works tackled these problems using techniques such as continuous approximations, greedy methods, and supervised machine learning-yet these approaches do not ensure optimality or even feasibility of the solutions. The main contribution of this work is threefold. First, an effective branch and bound (B&B) framework is proposed for the considered problem that guarantees global optimality by leveraging existing BF and RBF solvers. Second, to expedite the potentially costly B&B algorithm, a machine learning (ML)-based scheme is pro-posed to help skip intermediate states of the B&B search tree. The learning model features a graph neural network (GNN)-based design that is resilient to a commonly encountered challenge in wireless communications, namely, the change of problem size (e.g., the number of users) across the training and test stages. Third, comprehensive performance characterizations are presented, showing that the GNN-based method retains the global optimality of B&B with provably reduced complexity, under reasonable conditions. Numerical simulations also show that the ML-based acceleration can often achieve an order-of-magnitude speedup relative to B&B.

This shortcoming motivates an assessment of the utility of Argo-type floats, the challenges of deploying such floats due to the presence of sea ice, and the implications of extended times of no surfacing on hydrographic inferences. Within the framework of an Arctic coupled ocean-sea ice state estimate that is constrained to available satellite and in situ observations, we establish metrics for quantifying the usefulness of such floats. The likelihood of float surfacing strongly correlates with the annual sea ice minimum cover. Within the float lifetime of 4-5 years, surfacing frequency ranges from 10-100 days in seasonally sea ice- covered regions to 1-3 years in multiyear sea ice-covered regions. The longer the float drifts under ice without surfacing, the larger the uncertainty in its position, which translates into larger uncertainties in hydrographic measurements. Below the mixed layer, especially in the western Arctic, normalized errors remain below 1, suggesting that measurements along a path whose only known positions are the beginning and end points can help constrain numerical models and reduce hydrographic uncertainties. The error assessment presented is a first step in the development of quantitative methods for guiding the design of observing networks. These results can and should be used to inform a float network design with suggested locations of float deployment and associated expected hydrographic uncertainties.

Toward Water-Based Recycling Techniques: Methodologies for Homogeneous Catalyst Recycling in Liquid/Liquid Multiphase Media and Their Implementation in Continuous Processes	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												Biphasic water-based solvent systems offer the opportunity of efficient recycling of homogeneous catalysts. Water separates well from most organic solvents; therefore, water-soluble catalysts can be immobilized in this phase. Furthermore, water can substitute hazardous and environmentally unfriendly organic solvents in these systems. Within industry only the Ruhrchemie/Rhosne-Poulenc process uses plain water to immobilize the homogeneous catalyst for the hydroformylation of propene. Yet for more hydrophobic substrates, no water-based system has been commercialized. This review will summarize recent developments in the field of water-based recycling strategies. Topics in this field are the intensification of the mixing process, the use of thermomorphic solvent systems, and the employment of several additives, like alcohols and surfactants. Continuously operated processes for these recycling strategies will be presented and discussed.

The design of Zhang dynamics (ZD) is based on the elimination of an indefinite error-function, instead of the elimination of a square-based positive or at least lower-bounded energy-function usually associated with gradient dynamics (GD) and/or Hopfield-type neural networks. In this paper, we generalize, develop, investigate and compare the continuous-time ZD (CTZD) and GD models for online solution of time-varying and static square roots. In addition, a simplified continuous-time ZD (S-CTZD) and discrete-time ZD (DTZD) models are generated for static scalar-valued square roots finding. In terms of such scalar square roots finding problem, the Newton iteration (also termed, Newton-Raphson iteration) is found to be a special case of the DTZD models (by focusing on the static-problem solving, utilizing the linear activation function and fixing the step-size to be 1). Computer-simulation results via a power-sigmoid activation function further demonstrate the efficacy of the ZD solvers for online scalar (time-varying and static) square roots finding, in addition to the DTZD's link and new explanation to Newton-Raphson iteration.

Thermodynamic and morphological analysis indicated that co-continuous NR/ENR blend favored the formation of CCB network, providing the composites with superior electromagnetic properties. Electrical conductivity, dielectric loss and reflection loss over C-band (8-12 GHz) of CCB/NE/ENR composite were found to be a function of NR/ENR ratio, and reached the optimum value of 0.34 S/m, 0.31 and -23.58 dB when NR/ENR was 70/30 (wt./wt.), respectively.

However, CSP has the typical structure that allows application of the Benders decomposition, which is known to suffer from oscillation and slow convergence, compounded with the fact that the master problem is combinatorial. To overcome this drawback, we present a stabilized Benders decomposition whose master is restricted to a neighborhood of successful candidates by local-branching constraints, which are dynamically adjusted, and even dropped, during the iterations. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world instances with up to 24,000 binary variables, 181 million (M) continuous variables, and 367M constraints show that our approach is competitive with both the current state-of-the-art code for CSP and the Benders implementation in CPLEX 12.7. In some instances, stabilized Benders provided a very good solution in less than 1 minute, whereas the other approaches found no feasible solution in 1 hour.

Synthetic mixed-signal computation in living cells	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Living cells implement complex computations on the continuous environmental signals that they encounter. These computations involve both analogue- and digital-like processing of signals to give rise to complex developmental programs, context-dependent behaviours and homeostatic activities. In contrast to natural biological systems, synthetic biological systems have largely focused on either digital or analogue computation separately. Here we integrate analogue and digital computation to implement complex hybrid synthetic genetic programs in living cells. We present a framework for building comparator gene circuits to digitize analogue inputs based on different thresholds. We then demonstrate that comparators can be predictably composed together to build band-pass filters, ternary logic systems and multi-level analogue-to-digital converters. In addition, we interface these analogue-to-digital circuits with other digital gene circuits to enable concentration-dependent logic. We expect that this hybrid computational paradigm will enable new industrial, diagnostic and therapeutic applications with engineered cells.

Numerical Investigation of the Influence of Microchannel Geometry on the Droplet Generation Process	JOURNAL OF APPLIED FLUID MECHANICS												Two immiscible fluids flowing in microchannels are essential for microdevices to achieve efficient transfer of fluid reactions and heat, droplet mixing, extraction, and emulsification. In this study, a numerical investigation of the flow regime of droplet generation and the droplet breakup behavior of immiscible fluids (water and oil) in various microchannel structures was undertaken. To predict the influence of the microchannel structure on droplet generation and the breakup process, a two-phase level set method was implemented. The generated droplets were validated with experimental results of the T-shape microchannel structure. The obtained numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, the validated model was used to investigate the effect of various types of microchannel structures on droplet generation and breakup behavior. Also, the effects of different viscosities, wetted wall contact angles, surface tension, the size of continuous and dispersed channel widths, and the continuous flow rate for droplet generation and breakup in the microchannel were studied. This work contributes to better understanding of effective microchannel design.

A random variable which is subject to a Markov chain is introduced to govern the jumping uncertainties. Considering the unreliable channels between the system and filters, a discrete-time fading model is introduced to describe this channel fading phenomenon with the discrete probability distribution of each channel coefficients known a priori. On the basis of a fixed network topology, by establishing the periodic Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions on the existence of distributed filter are proposed to ensure the stability and dissipativity of the filtering error system.

We formulate a non-linear mixed integer program, minimizing the long-term cumulative cost of such a federated learning system while guaranteeing the desired convergence of the machine learning models being trained. We then design a set of novel polynomial-time online algorithms to make adaptive decisions by solving continuous solutions and converting them to integers to control the system on the fly, based only on the predicted inputs about the dynamic and uncertain cloud-edge environments via online learning. We rigorously prove the competitive ratio, capturing the multiplicative gap between our approach using predicted inputs and the offline optimum using actual inputs. Extensive evaluations with real-world training datasets and system parameters confirm the empirical superiority of our approach over multiple state-of-the-art algorithms.

This study concentrates on the material design and performance improvement of conductive asphalt concrete, which exploits the intrinsic conductive behavior of carbon fiber (CF) as a smart structural material in addition to iron tailings aggregates (TA). TA is introduced as a partial substitute of natural aggregates (NA), to provide continuous conductive structural contacts throughout the mixture for improvement in electrical and mechanical performance. To achieve this goal, first TA and NA were analyzed for chemical and phase compositions. The characterization manifested that TA exhibits a complex composition consisting of different species of iron. Secondly, a materially optimized conductive mix composition was developed in terms of the balance between electrical and mechanical properties. The results indicated that the addition of 0.2%-0.4% CF by weight to the mixture concludes optimum conductive mixtures for critical performance evaluation. Moreover, it was revealed that the addition of CF with TA significantly improves the electrical and mechanical properties of mixtures. Thirdly, electromechanical testing was conducted to explore the resistance change response of optimum conductive mixtures against changes in composition (deformation) induced as a result of mechanical loading. The results indicated that resistance change response to mechanical loading depends on the mix composition, type of loading and geometry of the test specimen. The reversible and smooth variation in resistance shows a mix with good structural integrity and its ability to heal deformation during unloading. By contrast, the irreversible and discontinuous variation in resistance is referred to as the damaging of the conductive network and eventually the structural failure. The mix incorporating 0.4% CF and TA as a partial substitute of NA serves as a smart composition since it retains satisfactory mechanical strength and responds to minor and reversible effects during mechanical loading.

The applications' visuality, through photography and design interface, can be related to an emphasis on the extra-musical dimension and the moment of the user. The continuous supply of music, and its effect on human behavior, allow us to speak about the concept of energy in relation to these services. Lastly, connectivity, through social networking features included in the applications themselves, adds to these services a social dimesion, encompassing group dynamics and the use of data for market predictions. This paper describes how these three ways define how the user will receive the music that he/she listens, and therefore, make of these applications an example of interpassivity, which in turn contributes to a standardization of taste and of the horizon of possibilities for the user.

In order to overcome the numerical difficulties associated with the resulting large-scale stochastic mixed-integer-linear-programming (MILP) problem, an approximation strategy comprising two steps, and based on the resolution of a set of deterministic and two-stage stochastic models is presented. The performance of the proposed strategy regarding computation time and optimality gap is studied through comparison with other traditional approaches that address optimization under uncertainty. Results indicate that the proposed strategy provides better solutions than stand-alone two-stage stochastic programming and two-stage shrinking-horizon algorithms for similar computational efforts and incurs much lower computation times than the rigorous multistage stochastic model.

J	Tukamuhabwa, B; Stevenson, M; Busby, J				Tukamuhabwa, Benjamin; Stevenson, Mark; Busby, Jerry			Supply chain resilience in a developing country context: a case study on the interconnectedness of threats, strategies and outcomes	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Purpose - In few prior empirical studies on supply chain resilience (SCRES), the focus has been on the developed world. Yet, organisations in developing countries constitute a significant part of global supply chains and have also experienced the disastrous effects of supply chain failures. The purpose of this paper is therefore to empirically investigate SCRES in a developing country context and to show that this also provides theoretical insights into the nature of what is meant by resilience. Design/methodology/approach - Using a case study approach, a supply network of 20 manufacturing firms in Uganda is analysed based on a total of 45 interviews. Findings - The perceived threats to SCRES in this context are mainly small-scale, chronic disruptive events rather than discrete, large-scale catastrophic events typically emphasised in the literature. The data reveal how threats of disruption, resilience strategies and outcomes are interrelated in complex, coupled and non-linear ways. These interrelationships are explained by the political, cultural and territorial embeddedness of the supply network in a developing country. Further, this embeddedness contributes to the phenomenon of supply chain risk migration, whereby an attempt to mitigate one threat produces another threat and/or shifts the threat to another point in the supply network. Practical implications - Managers should be aware, for example, of potential risk migration from one threat to another when crafting strategies to build SCRES. Equally, the potential for risk migration across the supply network means managers should look at the supply chain holistically because actors along the chain are so interconnected. Originality/value - The paper goes beyond the extant literature by highlighting how SCRES is not only about responding to specific, isolated threats but about the continuous management of risk migration. It demonstrates that resilience requires both an understanding of the interconnectedness of threats, strategies and outcomes and an understanding of the embeddedness of the supply network. Finally, this study's focus on the context of a developing country reveals that resilience should be equally concerned both with smaller in scale, chronic disruptions and with occasional, large-scale catastrophic events.

A scale-free collaborative nonlinear and linear dynamic protocols design methodology is developed for discrete-time multi-agent systems with both full and partial-state couplings. The scale-free nonlinear dynamic protocol is developed via design based on scheduling for discrete-time linear general dynamics. Meanwhile, the scale-free linear observer-based protocol design is proposed for a class of neutrally stable discrete-time agent models. Our protocol design methodology does not need any knowledge of the directed network topology and the spectrum of the associated Laplacian matrix. Moreover, the proposed protocol is scalable and achieves synchronization for any arbitrary number of agents.

J	Kosai, S; Unesaki, H				Kosai, Shoki; Unesaki, Hironobu			Short-term vs long-term reliance: Development of a novel approach for diversity of fuels for electricity in energy security	APPLIED ENERGY												Diversity in fuels for electricity is widely considered as a factor in the long-term energy security and the degree of reliance is based upon accounting for energy generation by power source. However, it is essential to also consider short-term risk such as sudden supply interruptions in the evaluation of diversity. As there is a significant interaction between long- and short-term energy security, the reliance on energy sources for a continuous energy supply shall be analyzed from both long- and short-term perspective for well-understanding of diversity in fuels for electricity. In this study, the concept of long-term and short-term diversity in fuels for electricity is discussed and defined as the first step. Then, a methodology is developed to assess the dynamic vulnerability of a simplified single energy source-driven electricity system to the disruption of continuous power supply, where the disruption is arising from a sudden disturbance to the system. Through the quantitative analysis, the different degree of reliance and the inverse trend by each power source between short- and long-term vulnerability in the distributed and centralized networks were identified. The notable difference in the degree of diversity in fuels for electricity between the conventionally applied long-term notion and the newly developed short-term notion was also identified. For example, in some cases in a simplified distributed network, we discovered that the long-term vulnerability of solar PV was 2.7 times higher than that of battery, whilst for the short-term vulnerability this trend is reversed and the vulnerability of battery was 1.2 times higher than that of solar PV. Based on these findings, we conclude that the design policy of the electricity supply system should be reconsidered in terms of evaluating diversity in fuels for electricity.

A Randomized Model for Communicating Embedded Systems	2008 MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AUTOMATION, VOLS 1-4	Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation				16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation	JUN 25-27, 2008	Ajaccio, FRANCE	IEEE				Nowadays, there is an intense research activity in designing systems that operate in real life, physical environments. This research is spanned by various areas in computer science and engineering: embedded systems, reactive systems, wireless communications, hybrid systems, stochastic processes, etc. A severe limitation in the development of these systems is due to the mathematical foundation and complexity of the physical environment. Often, the physical environment is continuous and uncertain, and modelled in terms of continuous stochastic processes. These mathematics are quite different from the underlying mathematics of discrete controllers based on logic and algebra. In this paper, we make further developments of Hilbertean formal methods, an integrated specification framework based with a rich algebraic semantics. This framework axiomatises and abstracts away advanced structures from functional and stochastic analysis. We integrate a probabilistic version of Pi-calculus to provide a rigorous framework for embedded systems with mobile and adaptive communication structure. The integration mechanism is based on partial ordered sets. The resulting framework has the modelling power of connectionist models like neural networks. Moreover, we construct an energy integral to every specification. The power of formal specification and stochastic analysis are combined in a rigorous mathematical framework for the software development of embedded systems. In this way, we achieve a new foundation for the multidimensional codesign.																			2325-369X		978-1-4244-2504-4				2008							1772	+																WOS:000261534400296

Considering both facets is especially important for wireless sensor networks, distributed control applications, and many other systems of growing importance. An important traditional design and verification goal for such systems is to ensure that unsafe states can never be reached. In the stochastic setting, this translates to the question whether the probability to reach unsafe states remains tolerable. In this paper, we consider stochastic hybrid systems where the continuous-time behaviour is given by differential equations, as for usual hybrid systems, but the targets of discrete jumps are chosen by probability distributions. These distributions may be general measures on state sets. Also non-determinism is supported, and the latter is exploited in an abstraction and evaluation method that establishes safe upper bounds on reachability probabilities. To arrive there requires us to solve semantic intricacies as well as practical problems. In particular, we show that measurability of a complete system follows from the measurability of its constituent parts. On the practical side, we enhance tool support to work effectively on such general models. Experimental evidence is provided demonstrating the applicability of our approach on three case studies, tackled using a prototypical implementation.

Modelling and Control of DC-DC Switching Converters: A Tutorial Perspective	REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE AUTOMATICA E INFORMATICA INDUSTRIAL												Basic concepts of modelling and control of DC-to-DC switching converters are presented in a tutorial approach. After defining Power Electronics and its application domain, DC-DC switching conversion is presented as the basic core of the domain, and power converters are classified as variable structure systems. The notion of switching regulator is subsequently introduced and the operation of a pulse width modulator is described to eventually derive a continuous-time model from the averaged converter dynamics. Using the converter continuous-time model, a dynamic model of the switching regulator is obtained and both one-loop and cascaded linear controllers are described. Non-linear control of switching converters is studied through the induction of sliding regimes in power converters. Equivalences between sliding systems and those employing a pulse width modulator are established and some applications are described. Finally, a compilation of techniques for the non-linear dynamics analysis in switching converters is introduced by means of a generalized description based on a discrete-time model that predicts the resulting bifurcations and allows controlling the chaos.

There is a need to understand the dynamics of cellular proliferation to get deeper insights into the prevalence of cancer. Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is implicated as the central regulator of the metabolic pathway involved in growth whereas its two distinct complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 perform particular functions in cellular propagation. To date, mTORC1 is a well defined therapeutic target to inhibit uncontrolled cell division, while the role of mTORC2 is not well characterized. Therefore, the current study is designed to understand the signaling dynamics of mTOR and its partner proteins such as PI3K, PTEN, mTORC2, PKB (Akt), mTORC1, and FOXO. For this purpose, a qualitative model of mTOR-associated Biological Regulatory Network (BRN) is constructed to predict its regulatory behaviors which may not be predictable otherwise. The depleted expression of PTEN and FOXO along with the overexpression of PI3K, mTORC2, mTORC1 and Akt is predicted as a stable steady state which is in accordance with their observed expression levels in the progression of various cancers. The qualitative model also predicts the homeostasis of all the entities in the form of qualitative cycles. The significant qualitative (discrete) cycle is identified by analyzing betweenness centralities of the qualitative (discrete) states. This cycle is further refined as a linear hybrid automaton model with the production (activation) and degradation (inhibition) time delays in order to analyze the real-time constraints for its existence. The analysis of the hybrid model provides a formal proof that during homeostasis the inhibition time delay of Akt is less than the inhibition time delay of mTORC2. In conclusion, our observations characterize that in homeostasis Akt is degraded with a faster rate than mTORC2 which suggests that the inhibition of Akt along with the activation of mTORC2 may be a better therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer.

Design and simulation of optoelectronic neuron-equivalentors as hardware accelerators of self-learning equivalent-convolutional neural structures (SLECNS)	NEURO-INSPIRED PHOTONIC COMPUTING	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Neuro-Inspired Photonic Computing	APR 23, 2018	Strasbourg, FRANCE	SPIE, Strasbourg Europtimist, CNRS, Investissements Avenvir, iCube, Univ Strasbourg				In the paper, we consider the urgent need to create highly efficient hardware accelerators for machine learning algorithms, including convolutional and deep neural networks (CNN and DNNS), for associative memory models, clustering, and pattern recognition. These algorithms usually include a large number of multiply-accumulate (and the like) operations. We show a brief overview of our related works the advantages of the equivalent models (EM) for describing and designing neural networks and recognizing bio-inspired systems. The capacity of NN on the basis of EM and of its modifications, including auto-and hetero-associative memories for 2D images, is in several times quantity of neurons. Such neuroparadigms are very perspective for processing, clustering. recognition, storing large size and strongly correlated and highly noised images. They are also very promising for solving the problem of creating machine uncontrolled learning. And since the basic operational functional nodes of EM are such vector-matrix or matrix-tensor procedures with continuous-logical operations as: normalized vector operations "equivalence", "nonequivalence", "auto equivalence". "auto-nonequivalence", we consider in this paper new conceptual approaches to the design of full-scale arrays of such neuron-equivalentors (NEs) with extended functionality, including different activation functions. Our approach is based on the use of analog and mixed (with special coding) methods for implementing the required operations, building NEs (with number of synapsis from 8 up to 128 and more) and their base cells, nodes based on photosensitive elements and CMOS current mirrors. We show the results of modeling the proposed new modular scalable implementations of NEs, we estimates and compare them. Simulation results show that processing time in such circuits does not exceed units of micro seconds, and for some variants 50-100 nanoseconds. Circuits are simple, have low supply voltage (1.5 - 3.3 V), low power consumption (milliwatts), low levels of input signals (microwatts), integrated construction, satisfy the problem of interconnections and cascading. Signals at the output of such neurons can be both digital and analog, or hybrid, and also with two complement outputs. They realize principle of dualism which gives a number of advantages of such complement dual NEs.

J	Cano, A; Luna, JM; Gibaja, EL; Ventura, S				Cano, Alberto; Maria Luna, Jose; Gibaja, Eva L.; Ventura, Sebastian			LAIM discretization for multi-label data	INFORMATION SCIENCES												Multi-label learning is a challenging task in data mining which has attracted growing attention in recent years. Despite the fact that many multi-label datasets have continuous features, general algorithms developed specially to transform multi-label datasets with continuous attributes' values into a finite number of intervals have not been proposed to date. Many classification algorithms require discrete values as the input and studies have shown that supervised discretization may improve classification performance. This paper presents a Label-Attribute Interdependence Maximization (LAIM) discretization method for multi-label data. LAIM is inspired in the discretization heuristic of CAIM for single-label classification. The maximization of the label-attribute interdependence is expected to improve labels prediction in data separated through disjoint intervals. The main aim of this paper is to present a discretization method specifically designed to deal with multi-label data and to analyze whether this can improve the performance of multi-label learning methods. To this end, the experimental analysis evaluates the performance of 12 multi-label learning algorithms (transformation, adaptation, and ensemble-based) on a series of 16 multi-label datasets with and without supervised and unsupervised discretization, showing that LAIM discretization improves the performance for many algorithms and measures.

C	Mikhnev, V; Vainikainen, P		Nguyen, C		Mikhnev, V; Vainikainen, P			Practical method for the frequency domain reconstruction of stratified dielectric media	SUBSURFACE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS II	Proceedings of SPIE				2nd International Conference on Subsurface Sensing Technologies and Applications	JUL 31-AUG 03, 2000	SAN DIEGO, CA	SPIE				During the last decade, popularity of the stepped frequency continuous wave (SFCW) subsurface radar had considerably grown compared to pulse radar, which was commonly used for ground penetration. This can be attributed to decreasing cost of RF technologies, more flexibility of SFCW systems from a viewpoint of antenna design, applicability of calibration and better signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. Typically, signal processing in frequency domain radar is based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) followed by some imaging method utilizing spatial distributions of collected data such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This paper addresses the problem of deriving as much as possible information from the measurement at a single antenna position, or spatial point. To this end, an inverse scattering approach retrieving the dielectric permittivity profile as a function of depth from the frequency domain data is presented. The method is capable to locate subsurface objects and distinguish between them depending on their permittivity value compared to the background. The validity and high robustness of the method are demonstrated with the use of synthetic data obtained for layered dielectric media. Experimental verification has been performed in the frequency band of 1 to 4 GHz using vector network analyzer (VNA). The influence of operational frequency band on the radar characteristics is discussed.

The new DNDP can determine both capacity improvement grades of reconstruction roads and locations and capacity grades of newly added roads, and thus complies with the practical projects where road capacity can only be some discrete levels corresponding to the number of lanes of roads. This paper designed a solution algorithm combining branch-and-bound with Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, where feasible integer solutions are recorded in searching the process of Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, lending itself to determine the upper bound of the upper-level problem.

C	Desai, S; Hohil, ME; Bass, H; Chambers, J		Gardner, PJ		Desai, S; Hohil, ME; Bass, H; Chambers, J			Reliable classification of high explosive and chemical/biological artillery using acoustic sensors	Chemical and Biological Sensing VI	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)				Conference on Chemical and Biological Sensing VI	MAR 28-29, 2005	Orlando, FL	SPIE				Feature extraction methods based on the discrete wavelet transform and multiresolution analysis are used to develop a robust classification algorithm that reliably discriminates between conventional and simulated chemical/biological artillery rounds via acoustic signals produced during detonation utilizing a generic acoustic sensor. Based on the transient properties of the signature blast distinct characteristics arise within the different acoustic si-natures because high explosive warheads emphasize concussive and shrapnel effects, while chemical/biological warheads are designed to disperse their contents over large areas, therefore employing a slower burning, less intense explosive to mix and spread their contents. The ensuing blast waves are readily characterized by variations in the corresponding peak pressure and rise time of the blast, differences in the ratio of positive pressure amplitude to the negative amplitude, and variations in the overall duration of the resulting waveform. Unique attributes can also be identified that depend upon the properties of the gun tube, projectile speed at the muzzle, and the explosive burn rates of the warhead. The algorithm enables robust classification of various airburst signatures using acoustics. It is capable of being integrated within an existing chemical/biological sensor, a stand-alone generic sensor, or a part of a disparate sensor suite. When emplaced in high-threat areas, this added capability would further provide field personal with advanced battlefield knowledge without the aide of so-called "sniffer" sensors that rely upon air particle information based on direct contact with possible contaminated air. In this work, the discrete wavelet transform is used to extract the predominant components of these characteristics from air burst si-natures at ranges exceeding 2km while maintaining temporal sequence of the data to keep relevance to the transient differences of the airburst si-natures. Highly reliable discrimination is achieved with a feedforward neural network classifier trained on a feature space derived from the distribution of wavelet coefficients and higher frequency details found within different levels of the multiresolution decomposition the neural network then is capable of classifying new airburst signatures as Chemical/Biological or High Explosive.																			0277-786X		0-8194-5780-9				2005	5795						142	152		10.1117/12.603688	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.603688													WOS:000231049800017

Further studies and simulations of the stress shadow effects are necessary to understand the controlling mechanism and evaluate the fracturing effect.Design/methodology/approachIn the process of stress-dependent unstable dynamic propagation of fractures, there are both continuous stress fields and discontinuous fractures; therefore, in order to study the stress-dependent unstable dynamic propagation of multistage fracture networks, a series of continuum-discontinuum numerical methods and models are reviewed, including the well-developed extended finite element method, displacement discontinuity method, boundary element method and finite element-discrete element method.FindingsThe superposition of the surrounding stress field during fracture propagation causes different degrees of stress shadow effects between fractures and the main controlling factors of stress shadow effects are fracture initiation sequence, perforation cluster spacing and well spacing. The perforation cluster spacing varies with the initiation sequence, resulting in different stress shadow effects between fractures; for example, the smaller the perforation cluster spacing and well spacing are, the stronger the stress shadow effects are and the more seriously the fracture propagation inhibition arises. Moreover, as the spacing of perforation clusters and well spacing increases, the stress shadow effects decrease and the fracture propagation follows an almost straight pattern. In addition, the computed results of the dynamic distribution of stress-dependent unstable dynamic propagation of fractures under different stress fields are summarised.Originality/valueA state-of-art review of stress shadow effects and continuum-discontinuum methods for stress-dependent unstable dynamic propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures are well summarized and analysed. This paper can provide a reference for those engaged in the research of unstable dynamic propagation of multiple hydraulic structures and have a comprehensive grasp of the research in this field.

Exponential stabilization of nonlinear switched systems with distributed time-delay: An average dwell time approach	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												In this paper, the exponential stabilization problem is discussed for nonlinear switched systems subject to the distributed time-delay. Attention is focused on the design of a state feedback controller such that, the closed-loop system is exponentially stable with a guaranteed weighted L-2 gain. By resorting to the average dwell time method and the piecewise Lyapunov functional approach, sufficient conditions are derived for the solvability of the addressed problem in terms of the feasibility of certain Hamilton Jacobi inequalities (HJIs). The explicit expression of the desired controller is formulated via solving the presented set of HJIs. Furthermore, within the proposed framework, the exponential stabilization problems are investigated, respectively, for nonlinear switched systems with mixed time-delays and linear switched systems with the distributed time-delay.

This task requires the coupling of a state estimation routine and an optimisation algorithm. As for the former, a sequential filtering approach to estimate the satellite state distribution conditional on received indirect measurements has been employed. To generate candidates, i.e. observation campaigns, a Structured-Chromosome Genetic Algorithm optimiser has been developed, which is able to address the issue of handling mixed-discrete global optimisation problems with variable-size design space. The search algorithm bases its strategy on revised genetic operators that have been reformulated for handling hierarchical search spaces. The presented approach aims at supporting the space sector by tracking both operational satellites and non-collaborative space debris in response to the challenge of a constantly increasing population size in the near Earth environment. The potential of the presented methodology is shown by solving the optimisation of a tracking window schedule for a very low Earth satellite operating in a highly perturbed dynamical environment.

In a dynamic MEC system, the fine-grained cooperative and dynamic offloading solution is necessary for the scenario of reusing tasks among devices. Considering the transmission cooperation, shared wireless bandwidth, and changing task queues on devices and edge servers, we formulate a joint offloading optimization problem to minimize the long-term average task execution cost. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a popular method for the dynamic problem, existing DRL algorithms are not suitable for our problem because of the hybrid discrete-continuous action spaces and constraints among action dimensions. Therefore, we propose a hybrid average reward proximal policy optimization (hybrid-ARPPO) algorithm to jointly optimize the offloading decisions, cooperative transmission ratios, and edge server assignments. First, we decompose our offloading problem into two subproblems. One is a tractable linear programming problem for continuous transmission ratios, and the other is a Markov decision process (MDP) only with discrete actions for offloading decisions and server assignments. Second, we take the expected average reward as the performance measure and deprecate the discount factor, which can reduce the work of tuning algorithms. Third, we design an action mask layer in the policy network of hybrid-ARPPO to filter invalid actions. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our hybrid-ARPPO in different system scales and task arrival patterns.

J	Yamé, JJ				Yame, Joseph J.			SOME REMARKS ON THE CONTROLLABILITY OF SAMPLED-DATA SYSTEMS	SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION												This paper raises the question of controllability (or more precisely, reachability) of sampled-data systems, i.e., systems composed of a continuous-time plant controlled by a digital controller. The question is formulated from the continuous-time perspective, and the study is carried out in a functional analytic framework. The novelty of the study lies in the infinite-dimensionality of the underlying physical state signals which comes from the fact that the plant actually evolves over a temporal continuum. Different concepts of controllability related directly to the continuous-time behavior of sampled-data systems are introduced, namely exact, approximate, and null controllability. It is shown that the two former notions never occur in sampled-data systems, while the latter notion is a generic property for these systems. Some facts regarding the fundamental input/output structure of sampled-data systems from the control viewpoint are drawn from these results. The spectrum distribution of sampled-data feedback systems is also characterized, and its connection to the controllability properties is pointed out. By way of contrast, the system-theoretic viewpoint adopted in this paper departs from the finite-dimensional state-space system approach which has been taken at the outset in the lifting framework, and in which the pure discrete-time state of the "stroboscopic" model is chosen as the state of the hybrid sampled-data systems. Such a choice for a minimal finite-dimensional state space is justified by the external (input/output) treatment of sampled-data systems. We stress the fact that this paper is situated entirely at the internal level and takes a closer look into the internal continuous-time dynamics of sampled-data systems.

With the continuous improvement of the PMSM performance requirements, its heat dissipation has also attracted increasing attention. This paper proposes a cooling system to realize the heat dissipation of the motor through internal oil circulation and external water circulation. Meanwhile, to obtain the best cooling system parameters, an optimization framework is developed for heat dissipation optimization of the motor. First, the most suitable Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method is selected for sampling through the Coordinates exchange algorithm. Second, we separately study the modeling accuracy of thirteen surrogate models and finally select the back propagation (BP) neural network model. Then, we use six multi-objective optimization algorithms (MOOAs) to optimize the model, and select the optimal solution via the utopian point method. Finally, the motor heat dissipation situation is effectively improved, and the effectiveness and reliability of the optimization framework are proved, which provides an alternative mean for the heat dissipation design optimization of the motor and has prominent practical significance.

To estimate revenue, the company needs to anticipate customer behaviors. Due to the co-existence of competition and congestion, customer behaviors are explained as a two-stage process. In the first stage, customers make "channel"choices, i.e., they decide whether to seek services from the company. Such a choice reflects the market competition and is predicted by a discrete choice model. Subsequently, customers who select the company will choose one facility to patronize. Owing to congestion, the facility choice will induce "user equilibrium", which in return affects the outcome of market competition. To facilitate the company's decision-making in this complex business environment, we develop a generic modeling framework. Unfortunately, the proposed model is nonconvex. To solve it, we first design an approximate mixed-integer linear programming approach subject to adjustable approximation errors. We then propose a surrogate optimization framework for large-scale instances, which explores the hidden bilevel structure of the model and leverages a "learning-to-optimize"problem and a customer behavior estimation subroutine. Using extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis and draw practical implications.					su, hang/KEH-2976-2024; yang, yunfeng/KHT-9566-2024; zhao, yan/JNT-6961-2023; Wang, Xuechun/JRX-6509-2023; zheng, yan/JKJ-3632-2023; Yu, Xiaohan/KCK-5462-2024; Liu, Shao/JFK-0166-2023; song, yu/KCZ-2003-2024	Lin, Yun Hui/0000-0002-0691-5266; Liu, Shaojun/0000-0002-9528-926X													0305-0548	1873-765X				MAY	2023	153								106175	10.1016/j.cor.2023.106175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2023.106175		FEB 2023											WOS:000946945100001

This heterogeneous mixture presents the characteristics of tensegrity, providing the body with structurally integrity, stability and flexibility. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a novel soft robotic gripper based on tensegrity structures. Firstly, the design and working principle of the tensegrity-based robotic gripper is introduced, which is composed of a series of discrete rigid segments connected with tensegrity joints by means of tensional cables. Then, the kinematics of the robotic gripper is analyzed using force density method to obtain the relationship between the pose of the gripper and the tension of cables. Finally experiments on the developed prototype demonstrates that the robotic gripper is able to grasp various objects of different sizes, shapes, and materials. Additional desirable properties are derived from using tensegrity structures in the robotic gripper: light weight, high compliance, inherent safety, low cost, and waterproof and dustproof performance. It is suggested that tensegrity structures have great potential to be an effective alternative to the development of soft robotic grippers.																			2153-0858		978-1-6654-1714-3				2021							7398	7403		10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9635929	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9635929													WOS:000755125505127

Determining how to model the probability characteristics of such systems with high calculation accuracy using limited scenarios is a major difficulty of uncertainty description. This study proposes the use of an optimum quantile method based on the Wasserstein distance metric to generate a typical scenario set in an integrated energy system considering energy correlations based on weather conditions. The use of discrete variables, as opposed to continuous variables based on sampling techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, sets this study apart from other studies. The uncertainties of a typical network containing power, heat, and gas are analysed, and the results show that the proposed method can produce a typical scenario set with good precision.

Theequivalent continuous medium model and the discrete fracture network (DFN) model were, respectively, applied to calculate the seepage field of the study domain. Calculations were based on the integrity and permeability of rocks, the extent of fracture development, and the combination of geological and hydrogeological conditions in theHuizhou pump-storage hydropower station. The station generates electricity from the upper reservoir and stores power by pumping water from the lower to the upper reservoir. In this paper, the external water pressure around the cavern and variations in pressure with only one operational and one venting powerhouse were analyzed to build a predictive model. The results showed that the external water pressure was small with the current anti-seepage and drainage system that normal operation of the reservoir can be guaranteed. The results of external water pressure around the tunnels provided sound scientific evidence for the future design of antiseepage systems.					; Hou, Michael Zhengmeng/L-1676-2015; Wang, Daobing/L-2975-2017; LI, QI/F-5257-2011	Zhou, Ding/0000-0003-1556-2092; Hou, Michael Zhengmeng/0000-0002-8544-7172; Wang, Daobing/0000-0003-3579-7227; LI, QI/0000-0003-0679-4385													1468-8115	1468-8123					2017							1	11		10.1155/2017/8618613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/8618613													WOS:000399197100001

In this sense, the paper discusses what types of surrogate models are suitable for different practical problems as well as introduces the appropriate techniques for building and using these models. A number of examples of digital twin applications from both continuous processes and discrete manufacturing are presented to underline the potentials of utilising surrogate models.

J	Jayadi, R; Lai, YC; Chen, LC				Jayadi, Riyanto; Lai, Yuan-Cheng; Chen, Liang-Chun			An Interleaved-Sleeping-Listening scheduler for power saving in mobile stations	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING												In mobile networks, the power consumption of a mobile station (MS) can be reduced by entering sleep mode. However, when many connections coexist, the power-saving efficiency is barely satisfactory because the sleep windows of these connections do not overlap and the MS cannot enter sleep mode. Many previous studies tried to shift the sleep windows of some connections where the sleep window is a series of continuous frames. This paper proposes an Interleaved-Sleeping-Listening (ISL) scheduler, which overlaps discrete sleep frames, rather than sleep windows, of multiple connections to obtain a higher number of overlapped sleep frames. The simulation results show that ISL outperforms the previous work, Maximum Unavailability Interval (MUI). When two connections exist and the sleep ratio, the ratio of the sleep frames in a sleep cycle, for each connection is 0.5, ISL improves MUI by 37% on the ratio of unavailability and 15% on the power consumption.

It has received extensive attention from scholars due to its powerful computing power and brain-like information transmission mode. Its application potential is huge, but in the field of pattern recognition it has not been completely solved.

Two-Dimensional Polymers and Polymerizations	CHEMICAL REVIEWS												Synthetic chemists have developed robust methods to synthesize discrete molecules, linear and branched polymers, and disordered cross-linked networks. However, two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) prepared from designed monomers have been long missing from these capabilities, both as objects of chemical synthesis and in nature. Recently, new polymerization strategies and characterization methods have enabled the unambiguous realization of covalently linked macromolecular sheets. Here we review 2DPs and 2D polymerization methods. Three predominant 2D polymerization strategies have emerged to date, which produce 2DPs either as monolayers or multilayer assemblies. We discuss the fundamental understanding and scope of each of these approaches, including: the bond-forming reactions used, the synthetic diversity of 2DPs prepared, their multilayer stacking behaviors, nanoscale and mesoscale structures, and macroscale morphologies. Additionally, we describe the analytical tools currently available to characterize 2DPs in their various isolated forms. Finally, we review emergent 2DP properties and the potential applications of planar macromolecules. Throughout, we highlight achievements in 2D polymerization and identify opportunities for continued study.

J	Nugroho, SA; Taha, AF				Nugroho, Sebastian A.; Taha, Ahmad F.			Towards understanding sensor and control nodes selection in nonlinear dynamic systems: Lyapunov theory meets branch-and-bound	AUTOMATICA												Sensor and actuator selection problems (SASPs) are some of the core problems in dynamic systems design and control. These problems correspond to determining the optimal selection of sensors (measurements) or actuators (control nodes) such that certain estimation/control objectives can be achieved. While the literature on SASPs are indeed inveterate, the vast majority of the work focuses on linear(ized) representation of the network dynamics, resulting in the placements of sensors or actuators (SAs) that are valid for confined operating regions. As an alternative, herein we propose a new general framework for addressing SASPs in nonlinear dynamic systems (NDSs), assuming that the inputs and outputs are linearly coupled with the nonlinear dynamics. This is investigated through (i) classifying and parameterizing the NDSs into various nonlinear function sets, (ii) utilizing rich Lyapunov theoretic formulations, and (iii) designing a new customized branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm that exploits problem structure of the SASPs. The newly designed BnB routines are computationally more attractive than the standard one and also directly applicable to solve SASPs for linear systems. In contrast with contemporary approaches from the literature, our approach is suitable for finding the optimal SAs combination for stable/unstable NDSs that ensures stabilization of estimation error and closed-loop dynamics through a simple linear feedback control policy.

To overcome the bottleneck of the limited number of radio links in hybrid beamforming, we utilize the neural networks (NNs) to capture the inherent connection between the uplink and downlink channel data sets and extrapolate the downlink channels from a subset of the uplink channel state information. We study the antenna subset selection problem in order to achieve the best channel extrapolation and decrease the data size of NNs. The probabilistic sampling theory is utilized to approximate the discrete antenna selection as a continuous and differentiable function, which makes the back propagation of the deep learning feasible. Then, we design the proper off-line training strategy to optimize both the antenna selection pattern and the extrapolation NNs. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of our proposed massive MIMO channel extrapolation algorithm.					zhang, shun/O-9255-2019; Dobre, Octavia/B-1435-2008	Dobre, Octavia/0000-0001-8528-0512													2325-3746		978-1-7281-7236-1				2020							182	187																WOS:000649741500032

Preferential sampling arises when the process that determines the data locations and the process being modelled are stochastically dependent. Conventional geostatistical methods assume, if only implicitly, that sampling is non-preferential. However, these methods are often used in situations where sampling is likely to be preferential. For example, in mineral exploration, samples may be concentrated in areas that are thought likely to yield high grade ore. We give a general expression for the likelihood function of preferentially sampled geostatistical data and describe how this can be evaluated approximately by using Monte Carlo methods. We present a model for preferential sampling and demonstrate through simulated examples that ignoring preferential sampling can lead to misleading inferences. We describe an application of the model to a set of biomonitoring data from Galicia, northern Spain, in which making allowance for preferential sampling materially changes the results of the analysis.

In this paper, the consensus of a hybrid multi-agent system, that contains discrete-time and continuous-time second-order agents, in the presence of actuator faults is considered. To estimate the faults, an online fault observer is obtained and based on the estimations, graph theory is used to design the proper control law that provides the consensus of the agents. It is worth mentioning that various agent faults types with different inception times are considered in this study to showcase the superiority of the proposed fault observer. The simulation results are provided in the results and discussion section of this paper to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the actuator bias fault can disrupt the consensus of agents but, using the proposed compensator, we can solve this problem and re-establish the consensus after occurring the faults.

To estimate the external disturbance, a nonlinear discrete-time disturbance observer (DTDO) is designed. Furthermore, the system uncertainties are approximated by employing neural network (NN). Then, a discrete-time neural tracking control scheme is proposed based on the designed DTDO, the discrete-time tracking differentiator and the backstepping technique. Under the discrete-time Lyapunov analysis, the boundness of all the closed-loop system signals are proven.

Noisy Neuromorphic Neurons with RPG On-chip Noise Source	2017 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)				International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	MAY 14-19, 2017	Anchorage, AK	Int Neurol Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Intel, BMI, Budapest Semester Cognit Sci				Noise can play beneficial roles in neural network systems from biology to neuromorphic computing through stochastic resonance, averaging signals, and other mechanisms. To achieve the benefits of noise in neuromorphic circuits, we propose a random pulse generator(RPG) as a source of noise and describe its implementation in neuromorphic circuits. The RPG includes three components: an LED, a wave guide, and a single-photon avalanche diode(SPAD). The LED will generate photons in Poisson-distributed time intervals with Gaussian-distributed amplitude. Through a wave guide, the SPAD senses the photons and generate uV wavelength random pulses. The noise can be implemented in a discrete manner by connecting to an amplifier and in a continuous manner by connecting to a current mirror. The design was simulated using CMOS 180nm SPICE models. The generated variable signals are used in different parts of a BioRC neuromorphic neuron to implement a noisy neuron following different neurological findings. The noisy neuron's random postsynaptic potential(PSP), along with mechanisms to support stochastic resonance, noise inhibition and noise-forced spiking were demonstrated.																			2161-4393		978-1-5090-6182-2				2017							1225	1229																WOS:000426968701066

We show that process models can be generated from a given set of building and connecting elements, while the building elements are associated with local programs, declared in the prototype elements. The executable multiscale process architectures are described in a logical programming language. The case specific knowledge is contained in the expert and user programs that can be defined and modified via the expert and user interfaces. These dynamic partitions can be executed by the same, invariant kernel. The simulation based identification or optimization problems can be solved by the evaluation feedback(s) between the configurable, robust simulator and a multi-objective, discrete / continuous genetic algorithm. The executable architecture can be used for simulation, identification, process design and control, flux and sensitivity analysis, as well as for qualitative and quantitative tracing and tracking. The application is illustrated by two, extremely different models, prepared for a significant part of the p53 related signaling pathways, and for an agrifood process network interoperability system.

The properties and limitations of the most important artificial tracers are discussed, and the available methods of tracer injection, sampling, online monitoring and laboratory analysis are presented. Fully quantitative tracer experiments result in continuous or discrete concentration-time data series, i. e. breakthrough curves, and concomitant discharge data, which make it possible to obtain detailed information about groundwater flow and contaminant transport. Within the frame of speleological investigations, tracer tests can help to resolve the active and often inaccessible part of cave and conduit networks and to obtain indications about the geometry and volume of the conduits. For hydrogeological studies, caves can in turn be used as natural experimental and monitoring sites inside the unsaturated or saturated zone of karst aquifer systems.

Discrete choice experiment (DCE) to quantify the influence of trial features on the decision to participate in cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical trials	BMJ OPEN												Introduction Engaging people with cystic fibrosis (CF) in clinical trials is critical to improving outcomes for this fatal disease. Following extensive exploration of engagement in CF trials we believe six key concepts require a quantitative understanding of their influence in the current CF trials landscape including how controversial issues like placebos, washouts, stipend provision and location of trial visits are viewed by the CF community and how these might be modified depending on the type of medicine being investigated and the mechanism of access to the drug on trial completion. Methods and analysis We have designed and will administer an online discrete choice experiment to elicit and quantify preferences of people with CF for these trials' attributes and estimate the relative importance of an attribute when choosing to participate in a trial. The cross-sectional data generated will be explored using conditional multinomial logit model. Mixed logit models such as the random-parameters logit and a latent class models will be used to explore preference heterogeneity. To determine the relative importance of an attribute, the difference between the attribute level with the highest preference weight and the level with the lowest preference weight will be calculated. Ethics and dissemination Imperial College London Joint Research Compliance Office has granted ethical approval for this study. Patient consent will be sought following full explanation. No identifying information will be collected. Dissemination will be via international conferences, peer-review publication and patient accessible forums. Major CF trials networks have agreed to incorporate our findings into their review process, meaning our results can realistically influence and optimise CF trial delivery.

In this article we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to maximize the revenue of a utility-scale highway portable energy storage system (PESS) for on-demand electric vehicle charging. We consider a PESS that consists of an electric truck, battery, and charging stations on highways. Actions include the selection of stations and routes, the selection of charging and discharging, and the corresponding charging/discharging power selection. The first two are discrete, while the last is continuous. To deal with the hybrid action space and time-varying state space of PESS, we design an action space, observation space, and reward function according to its characteristics; in addition, we develop a state-of-the-art DRL model for online decision-making considering the uncertainty in the real-time market price of electricity. Through numerical simulations with real-world electricity price data in California, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm with contiguous frequency-domain resource allocation (FDRA) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that jointly selects users and allocates resource blocks (RBs). The scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov decision process, and a DRL agent determines which user and how many consecutive RBs for that user should be scheduled at each RB allocation step. The state space, action space, and reward function are delicately designed to train the DRL network. More specifically, the original quasi-continuous action space, which is inherent to contiguous FDRA, is refined into a finite and discrete action space to obtain a trade-off between the inference latency and system performance. Simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based scheduling algorithm outperforms other representative baseline schemes while having lower online computational complexity.																			2367-3370	2367-3389	978-3-030-80126-7; 978-3-030-80125-0				2021	284						648	660		10.1007/978-3-030-80126-7_46	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80126-7_46													WOS:000839363100046

In-plane mechanics of soft architectured fibre-reinforced silicone rubber membranes	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS												Silicone rubber membranes reinforced with architectured fibre networks were processed with a dedicated apparatus, allowing a control of the fibre content and orientation. The membranes were subjected to tensile loadings combined with continuous and discrete kinematical field measurements (DIC and particle tracking). These tests show that the mechanical behaviour of the membranes is hyperelastic at the first order. They highlight the influence of the fibre content and orientation on both the membrane in-plane deformation and stress levels. They also prove that for the considered fibrous architectures and mechanical loadings, the motion and deformation of fibres is an affine function of the macroscale transformation. These trends are fairly well described by the micromechanical model proposed recently in Bailly et al. (JMBBM, 2012). This result proves that these materials are very good candidates for new biomimetic membranes, e.g. to improve aortic analogues used for in vitro experiments, or existing textiles used for vascular (endo)prostheses.

For that purpose, it is necessary to describe the system dynamics either by continuous -time or discrete-time state equations in which uncertainty of parameters and initial conditions as well as the influence of noise are represented by bounded domains. The same holds for the system's output equation, where measurement noise is again assumed to be bounded with measurement time instants that are typically assumed to be perfectly known. This latter assumption is removed in this paper to make the bounded-error state estimation approach applicable to a wide range of systems where measurement time instants are only imprecisely known. This is typically the case for distributed control systems in which sensor and actuator signals are transmitted via a communication network. As such, the wide classes of robotic multi-agent systems as well as distributed energy systems belong to this kind of models.																			2835-2815		979-8-3503-1107-5				2023							157	162		10.1109/MMAR58394.2023.10242597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MMAR58394.2023.10242597													WOS:001074500100027

Devising NREN Design Goals from Commercial Network Design Guidelines	2016 IST-AFRICA WEEK CONFERENCE					IST-Africa Week Conference	MAY 11-13, 2016	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA					To design a network as big as SANReN network design goals need to be determined. The network design process is an iterative one that follows a top-down approach. The network design lifecycle is a continuous process that seeks improvement of the network design so that it better addresses business needs and goals. This paper provides an overview of the network design goals model that provides a process for determining network design goals for an NREN. The model is instantiated in the SANReN environment. The network design goals may be slightly different to a commercial service provider but the process for determining network design goals for a commercial service provider can be adapted for SANReN.																					978-1-9058-2455-7				2016																								WOS:000392264700113

It is assumed that each agent only interacts with its neighbors at discrete sampling instants rather than the complete continuous process. It is further assumed that the phenomenon of random link failures on the communication links is characterized by a Bernoulli stochastic variable. By supposing that each agent has a unique scale, a distributed control protocol that uses the sampled position information of the neighbors is designed. With the assistance of hybrid tools including graph theory and matrix theory, a sufficient condition based on the structures of topologies, the time-varying sampling periods, and the gain parameter, is established to ensure the asymptotic convergence of the agents under the action of sampled distributed protocol. Finally, some simulation instances are provided to verify our theoretical finding. (c) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper develops a novel and simple gradient-based meta learning method suitable for improving learning efficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods. Rather than designing complex network or adding excessive fine tuning parameters, the proposed method is simple and does not introduce any learned parameters for meta learning. Specifically, according to the characteristic of different trajectories, this paper proposes to weight every trajectory in model-agnostic meta-learning for meta updating gradient effectively. The key idea underlying this method is to take advantage of the relationship between different trajectories and the direction of parameter update. Additionally, an end-to-end training approach is also introduced so that the proposed model can attain good results with a small amount of training data on new tasks. The statistical results of the experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm delivers state-of-the-art performance on both discrete and continuous control tasks.

One of the main among the concerns have been lack of well-integrated, reliable and efficient public transport systems. This is particularly so in urban centres, due to rapid growth of the urban population coincided with the end of colonialism, giving rise to large scale economic, spatial and structural transformation of urban landscapes. The consciousness of the need for well-functioning innovative public transport systems by all spheres of governments and the private sector institutions has prompted precipitate action in the past decades to invest in innovative transport systems. Conversely, just like any other rapid growing metropolitan municipalities in developing and emerging economies, the city of Johannesburg has not been released with regards continuous public transport challenges. In the past decade, the City of Johannesburg has actively participated in the development of the first fast train system; the Gautrain in conjunction with two other metropolitan cities within the province. To support the innovative train system, the city also invested in and developed the Rea Vaya; a rapid bus system. However, the state of connectedness of the rail and road route networks within the city have not been well documented. Therefore, this study aims to delineate the extent routes network integration among Gautrain and Rea Vaya within the Johannesburg urban public transport system and how working relationships could be improved. The study adopted a phenomelogical case study survey design that applied mixed-method approaches to gather spatial, qualitative and quantitative data. The exploratory approach was used to formulate the research problem for precise investigation whilst the descriptive approach was used to gather complete and accurate information. Research techniques such as crowdsourcing, interviews, social media was used to collected data. Whilst data analysis and interpretations were conducted with techniques such as main content analysis, Geographic Information Technologies and Echo-Echo. Research findings; indicate that there are limited areas where the route networks between the public transport systems are connected. The large sections of the networks are disintegrated. The work recommends conscious efforts in planning and developing both rail and road route networks that are integrated to promote efficiency of public transport systems.																			2521-392X	2521-3938	978-3-9504173-4-0; 978-3-9504173-5-7				2018							225	234																WOS:000529386000021

Strategic Optimization of the Flushing Operations in Lubricant Manufacturing and Packaging Facilities	ACS OMEGA												Commercial lubricant industries use a complex pipeline network for the sequential processing of thousands of unique products annually. Flushing is conducted between changeovers to ensure the integrity of each production batch. An upcoming product is used for cleaning the residues of the previous batch, resulting in the formation of a commingled/mixed oil that does not match the specifications of either of the two batches. The existing operations are based on the operator's experience and trial and error. After a selected flush time, the samples are tested for their viscosity to determine the success of a flush. The approach results in long downtime, the generation of large commingled oil volumes, and huge economic losses. Hence, to overcome the drawback, our work introduces a solution strategy for systematically optimizing flushing operations and making more informed decisions to improve the resource-management footprint of these industries. We use the American Petroleum Institute-Technical Data Book (API-TDB) blending correlations for calculating the mixture viscosities in real-time. The blending correlations are combined with our first-principles models and validated against well-designed experimental data from the partnered lubricant facility. Next, we formulate an optimal control problem for predicting the optimum flushing times. We solve the problem using two solution techniques viz. Pontryagin's maximum principle and discrete-time nonlinear programming. The results from both approaches are compared with well-designed experimental data, and the economic and environmental significance are discussed. The results illustrate that with the application of a discrete-time nonlinear programming solution approach, the flushing can be conducted at a customized flow rate, and the necessary flushing volume can be reduced to over 30% as compared to the trial-and-error mode of operation.																			2470-1343					OCT 7	2023	8	41					38288	38300		10.1021/acsomega.3c04668	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c04668		OCT 2023						37867651					WOS:001082614500001

J	Pishvaei, SM; Tazehkand, BM				Pishvaei, Seyed Mahmoud; Tazehkand, Behzad Mozaffari			Discrete FBMC-based orthogonal time frequency space in wireless communications considering different prototype filters	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												Designing a proper multicarrier signaling technique for the next generation of mobile network communications is one of the challenging fields of study. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) as the standard multicarrier technique in 5G suffers from the out-of-band (OOB) leakage where using the filter-based multicarrier techniques like Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC) could reduce the OOB emission. Also, due to the requirement of serving under high mobility conditions such as vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and high-speed train communications, employing a functional multicarrier technique like Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is quite desirable. Besides, to gain good frequency localization, it is required to have a long symbol duration where the more longer symbol duration provides the less robustness of the waveform to mobility. Hence, the combination of OTFS and FBMC could be interesting to fit in at the same time and frequency localization, and support the mobility. As a phenomenal property, OTFS could be understood as a pre- and post-processing steps for the OFDM-based techniques which enables OTFS to cooperate with them. Therefore, to achieve a better performance, we extended the FBMC by applying the OTFS and implemented the FBMCbased OTFS technique which benefits from both OTFS and FBMC qualities. Besides, to reduce the computational complexity of the continuous form and contributing more analytical results, the discrete FBMC-based OTFS formulation is provided. Our accomplished analyses and simulated results certificate the FBMC-based OTFS superiority over different schemes in Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and error probability terms.(c) 2022 The Franklin Institute.

J	Chang, CT; Chang, CC				Chang, CT; Chang, CC			A linearization method for mixed 0-1 polynomial programs	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												This paper proposes a concise method for solving mixed 0-1 polynomial programming problems to obtain a global optimal solution. Given a mixed 0-1 polynomial term z = c(1)x(1)x(2)....x(n)y, where x(1), x(2),..., x(n) are 0-1 integer variables, y is a continuous variable, and c(t) is either a positive or a negative coefficient; we can transform z into a set of auxiliary constraints. Based on this transformation, the original mixed 0-1 polynomial program can then be solved directly by the branch-and-bound method. In addition, the proposed model for solving a mixed 0-1 polynomial problem is expressed in a much more compact way, and also uses fewer additional 0-1 variables and auxiliary constraints than the previous methods, such as those proposed by Glover, Oral-Kettani, and Li. The analytical superiority of this concise method in terms of the number of iterations and execution times can be seen, through a computational experiment conduced on a set of generated mixed 0-1 polynomial problems. Scope and purpose Decision-making problems, such as facility layout,job assignment, or Communication network designs are most often formulated as mixed integer problems. To solve this form of problem, Glover transformed a binary quadratic problem with n of 0-1 variables into linear inequalities by adding 4n auxiliary constraints and n continuous variables. Oral and Kettani later proposed another linearization procedure for binary quadratic and cubic problems, which substantially improved the technique of Glover by reducing the number of auxiliary constraints. Recently, Li presented a more general linearization approach for solving mixed 0-1 polynomial problems. Compared with previous model, Li's model is more promising for use in solving practical problems. This paper shows that it is possible to further modify Li's model by reducing the number of extra variables and auxiliary constraints in the linearization process. Some test examples with various sizes of variables demonstrate that this model uses less CPU time and has fewer iterations than Li's model, while reaching the same optimal solution.

J	Bandaru, S; Ng, AHC; Deb, K				Bandaru, Sunith; Ng, Amos H. C.; Deb, Kalyanmoy			Data mining methods for knowledge discovery in multi-objective optimization: Part A - Survey	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												Real-world optimization problems typically involve multiple objectives to be optimized simultaneously under multiple constraints and with respect to several variables. While multi-objective optimization itself can be a challenging task, equally difficult is the ability to make sense of the obtained solutions. In this two-part paper, we deal with data mining methods that can be applied to extract knowledge about multi-objective optimization problems from the solutions generated during optimization. This knowledge is expected to provide deeper insights about the problem to the decision maker, in addition to assisting the optimization process in future design iterations through an expert system. The current paper surveys several existing data mining methods and classifies them by methodology and type of knowledge discovered. Most of these methods come from the domain of exploratory data analysis and can be applied to any multivariate data. We specifically look at methods that can generate explicit knowledge in a machine-usable form. A framework for knowledge-driven optimization is proposed, which involves both online and offline elements of knowledge discovery. One of the conclusions of this survey is that while there are a number of data mining methods that can deal with data involving continuous variables, only a few ad hoc methods exist that can provide explicit knowledge when the variables involved are of a discrete nature. Part B of this paper proposes new techniques that can be used with such datasets and applies them to discrete variable multi-objective problems related to production systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-period Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) models were developed for this purpose and account for the dynamics in the profile of heat supply and demand using discrete time intervals/periods. The resulting models are applied to an industrial case study of a dairy plant for the two distinct integration alternatives of targeting one and multiple (two) cold stream utility requirements. The design and optimization of the integrated system is implemented and solved in GAMS. The results show good prospect for solar thermal utilization in industries with low temperature applications. Sensitivity analysis shows linear increase in the average attainable heat load up to certain collector area (on case-by-case basis), after which a break point is obtained where it is observed that additional increase in collector area does not result to much increase in the obtained heat load. For the selected case study of a dairy plant, average solar output of about 75 W/m(2) of collector is obtained. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Given the popularity of distributed-drive in battery electric vehicles (BEVs), this study selects a dual-motor four-speed electric bus to investigate the proposed soft actor-critic (SAC)-based EMS. Two im-provements are made to the traditional SAC algorithm to meet the special requirements of EMS in a distributed-drive electric bus in this study. Firstly, the introduced combination of Gumbel-SoftMax and actor-network allows the SAC agents to explore the hybrid action space (discrete operating modes and continuous torque distribution coefficients). Secondly, a heuristic rule-interposing action controller (HRIAC) is involved to reduce illogical exploration of SAC agents in searching for optimal power distributing ratio. Simulation results demonstrate that Gumbel-SoftMax facilitates agents' exploration and narrows the energy consumption gap between the proposed EMS and the global optimal EMS, meanwhile, HRIAC accelerates the convergence of agent training. The comparative results of proposed EMS performance in unknown driving cycles show that the proposed EMS outperforms other deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based EMSs in adaptability, which is taken as a solid foundation for energy efficiency improvement of dual-motor electric bus in practice.

Two-Dimensional Localized Flow Control Using Distributed, Biomimetic Feather Structures: A Comparative Study	BIOINSPIRATION, BIOMIMETICS, AND BIOREPLICATION	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Bioinspiration, Biomimetics, and Bioreplication	MAR 07-09, 2011	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Amer Soc Mech Engineers				This paper presents the development of a bioinspired flight control system and a characterization of its performance when operating in turbulent and gusting airflow conditions. This design consists of a skeletal structure with a network of feather-like panels installed on the upper and lower surfaces, extending beyond the trailing edge. Each feather is able to deform into and out of the boundary layer, thus permitting local airflow manipulation. The gust load sensing is predominately performed near the leading edge of the airfoil, and the reaction forces are generated by the feathers located at the trailing edge. For this study, the focus presents a benchmark case of the NACA 4412 airfoil with the standard 20% trailing edge flap design operating in a gusting, turbulent airflow. COMSOL Multiphysics is used to model the flow field and the fluid-structure interactions using Direct Numerical Simulation. The dynamics of the gusting model are developed using MATLAB and LiveLink connected to COMSOL to enable unsteady, turbulent simulations to be performed. Discrete and continuous gusts are simulated at various airfoil angles of attack. Additionally, the airfoils' aerodynamic performance is comparatively analyzed between time-varying and steady-state turbulence models. This paper discusses how these two-dimensional, time-varying turbulent and gusting airflow simulation results can be developed and integrated into a LQR closed-loop feed back flight control system.																			0277-786X		978-0-81948-537-3				2011	7975								79750L	10.1117/12.882310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.882310													WOS:000294773800015
J	PAULES, GE; FLOUDAS, CA				PAULES, GE; FLOUDAS, CA			STOCHASTIC-PROGRAMMING IN PROCESS SYNTHESIS - A 2-STAGE MODEL WITH MINLP RECOURSE FOR MULTIPERIOD HEAT-INTEGRATED DISTILLATION SEQUENCES	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This paper presents a two-stage stochastic programming approach with MINLP recourse for the synthesis problem of heat integrated distillation sequences that can handle prespecified changes in the composition and/or flowrate of the multicomponent feed to the separation system for a finite number of periods of operation. A new synthesis strategy is proposed that combines the aspects of a superstructure approach with a partitioning of the design variables into two classes: structural and periodic. Structural design variables comprise the fixed elements of a design that are common to all operating conditions, while the periodic design variables are adjustable quantities that can be changed for optimal operation in each period. The synthesis strategy identifies the optimal separation sequence and selection of heat exchanger units that can accommodate the different periods of operation. In addition, for each selected unit, the approach provides simultaneous optimization of the column pressure, reflux ratio, number of trays, diameter and heat integration/exchange matches. The column pressure, reflux, number of trays and diameter are treated explicitly as continuous variables in the model. The mathematical formulation that results is a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The structure of the problem can be exploited by viewing the multiperiod design problem as a two-stage stochastic programming problem with the feed composition and flowrate as the uncertain parameters. The different periods of operation provide the discretization of the uncertainty and the multiple scenarios of operation have (MINLP) recourse. A nested solution procedure is detailed that combines the Generalized Benders Decomposition and the Outer Approximation/Equality Relaxation algorithms. Emphasis is given to the application of this type of approach to the general synthesis problem and its potential for extension to design problems under uncertainty and/or flexibility requirements. Application of the approach is illustrated through an example problem.																			0098-1354	1873-4375				MAR	1992	16	3					189	210		10.1016/0098-1354(92)85006-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0098-1354(92)85006-T													WOS:A1992HM52900006
J	Li, KP; Huang, HF; Schonfeld, P				Li, Keping; Huang, Hangfei; Schonfeld, Paul			Metro Timetabling for Time-Varying Passenger Demand and Congestion at Stations	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION												For the train timetabling problem (TTP) in a metro system, the operator-oriented and passenger-oriented objectives are both important but partly conflicting. This paper aims to minimize both objectives by considering frequency (in the line planning stage) and train cost (in the vehicle scheduling stage). Time-varying passenger demand and train capacity are considered in a nonsmooth, nonconvex programming model, which is transformed into a mixed integer programming model with a discrete time-space graph (DTSG). A novel dwell time determining process considering congestion at stations is proposed, which turns the dwell times into dependent variables. In the solution approach, we decompose the TTP into a subproblem for optimizing segment travel times (OST) and a subproblem for optimizing departure headways from the shunting yard (OH). Branch-and-bound and frequency determining algorithms are designed to solve OST. A novel rolling optimization algorithm is designed to solve OH. The numerical experiments include case studies on a short metro line and Beijing Metro Line 4, as well as sensitivity analyses. The results demonstrate the predictive ability of the model, verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, and provide practical insights for different scenarios, which can be used for decision-making support in daily operations.

Recently, many researchers have utilized machine learning techniques to improve the fingerprint recognition rate. The random forest (RF) is found to be one of the extensively utilized machine learning techniques for fingerprint recognition. Although it provides good recognition results at significant computational speed, still there is room for improvement. RF is not so-effective for high-dimensional features and also when features contain both discrete and continuous values at the same time. Therefore, in this paper, a novel similarity measure-based random forest (NRF) is proposed. The proposed technique, initially, computes both mutual information and conditional entropy. Thereafter, it uses three designed if-then rules to obtain final information measure. Additionally, to obtain feature set for fingerprint dataset, dual-tree complex wavelet transform is used to evaluate complex detail coefficients. Thereafter, ring project is considered to compute significant moments from these complex detail coefficients. Finally, information gain-based feature selection technique is used to select potential features. To prevent over-fitting, 20-fold cross validation is also used. Extensive experiments are considered to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The comparative analyses reveal that the proposed technique outperforms the existing techniques in terms of accuracy, f-measure, sensitivity, specificity, kappa statistics and computational speed.

However, for cutout animations where continuous motion is combined with discrete artwork replacements, supporting a performance-driven workflow has some unique requirements. To trigger the appropriate artwork replacements, the system must reliably detect a wide range of customized facial expressions that are challenging for existing recognition methods, which focus on a few canonical expressions (e.g., angry, disgusted, scared, happy, sad and surprised). Also, real usage scenarios require the system to work in real-time with minimal training. In this paper, we propose a novel customized expression recognition technique that meets all of these requirements. We first use a set of handcrafted features combining geometric features derived from facial landmarks and patch-based appearance features through group sparsity based facial component learning. To improve discrimination and generalization, these handcrafted features are integrated into a custom-designed Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure trained from publicly available facial expression datasets. The combined features are fed to an online ensemble of SVMs designed for the few training sample problem and performs in realtime. To improve temporal coherence, we also apply a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to smooth the recognition results. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on canonical expression datasets and promising results on our collected dataset of customized expressions.

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimally selecting a subset of nodes from potentially a large number of candidates to form a virtual multi-antenna system, while at the same time designing their joint linear transmission strategies. We focus on two specific application scenarios: 1) multiple single antenna transmitters cooperatively transmit to a receiver; 2) a single transmitter transmits to a receiver with the help of a number of cooperative relays. We formulate the joint node selection and beamforming problems as cardinality constrained optimization problems with both discrete variables (used for selecting cooperative nodes) and continuous variables (used for designing beamformers). For each application scenario, we first characterize the computational complexity of the joint optimization problem, and then propose novel semi-definite relaxation (SDR) techniques to obtain approximate solutions. We show that the new SDR algorithms have a guaranteed approximation performance in terms of the gap to global optimality, regardless of channel realizations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated via numerical experiments.

These systems present significant challenges for monitoring and diagnosis. Many existing model-based approaches focus on diagnostic reasoning assuming appropriate fault signatures have been generated. However, an important missing piece is the integration of model-based techniques with the acquisition and processing of sensor signals and the modeling of faults to support diagnostic reasoning. This paper addresses key modeling and computational problems at the interface between model-based diagnosis techniques and signature analysis to enable the efficient detection and isolation of incipient and abrupt faults in hybrid systems. A hybrid automata model that parameterizes abrupt and incipient faults is introduced. Based on this model, an approach for diagnoser design is presented. The paper also develops a novel mode estimation algorithm that uses model-based prediction to focus distributed processing signal algorithms. Finally, the paper describes a diagnostic system architecture that integrates the modeling, prediction, and diagnosis components. The implemented architecture is applied to fault diagnosis of a complex electro-mechanical machine, the Xerox DC265 printer, and the experimental results presented validate the approach. A number of design trade-offs that were made to support implementation of the algorithms for online applications are also described.																			1083-4419	1941-0492				DEC	2005	35	6					1225	1240		10.1109/TSMCB.2005.850178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2005.850178								16366248					WOS:000233441800013
J	Zhu, YH; Zhao, DB; Li, XJ				Zhu, Yuanheng; Zhao, Dongbin; Li, Xiangjun			Iterative Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Solving Unknown Nonlinear Zero-Sum Game Based on Online Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												H-infinity control is a powerful method to solve the disturbance attenuation problems that occur in some control systems. The design of such controllers relies on solving the zero-sum game (ZSG). But in practical applications, the exact dynamics is mostly unknown. Identification of dynamics also produces errors that are detrimental to the control performance. To overcome this problem, an iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve the continuous-time, unknown nonlinear ZSG with only online data. A model-free approach to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation is developed based on the policy iteration method. Control and disturbance policies and value are approximated by neural networks (NNs) under the critic-actor-disturber structure. The NN weights are solved by the least-squares method. According to the theoretical analysis, our algorithm is equivalent to a Gauss-Newton method solving an optimization problem, and it converges uniformly to the optimal solution. The online data can also be used repeatedly, which is highly efficient. Simulation results demonstrate its feasibility to solve the unknown nonlinear ZSG. When compared with other algorithms, it saves a significant amount of online measurement time.

The same Harris Hawks Optimizer methodology was issued for converging towards optimum solutions in a multipleobjective criterion search space. For obtained well-distributed Pareto optimal front and their solution has better coverage. However, a non-dominated ranking with the crowding distance strategy is applied to HHO.

J	Alsharaiah, MA; Samarasinghe, S; Kulasiri, D				Alsharaiah, Mohammad Abdallah; Samarasinghe, Sandhya; Kulasiri, Don			Proteins as fuzzy controllers: Auto tuning a biological fuzzy inference system to predict protein dynamics in complex biological networks	BIOSYSTEMS												Biological systems such as mammalian cell cycle are complex systems consisting of a large number of molecular species interacting in ways that produce complex nonlinear systems dynamics. Discrete models such as Boolean models and continuous models such as Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been widely used to study these systems. Boolean models are simple and can capture qualitative systems behaviour, but they cannot capture the continuous trends of protein concentrations, while ODE models capture continuous trends but require kinetics parameters that are limited. Further, as systems get larger, complexity of these models becomes an issue for parameterization, analysis and interpretation. Also, molecular systems operate under the conditions of uncertainty and noise and our understanding of molecular processes in general is more at a qualitative level characterised by vagueness, imprecision and ambiguity. Hence, as more data are generated, there is a greater need for simpler data driven methods that can approximate continuous system behaviour while representing vagueness and ambiguity without requiring kinetic parameters. Fuzzy inferencing is one such promising method with the ability to work with qualitative vague/imprecise biological knowledge. In this study, we propose a fuzzy inference system for representing continuous behaviour of proteins and apply to some key proteins in the mammalian cell cycle system. The methods we introduced here is novel to protein interaction systems and cell cycle proteins. Our study proposes a three-stage approach to develop fuzzy protein controllers. In stage one, protein system is studied for interactions. We studied some significant core controllers of mammalian cell cycle and their producers and degraders as presented in a published ODE model. Based on the observations from a dataset generated from it, we developed Fuzzy inference systems (FIS) in the second stage, that involved deriving fuzzy IF-THEN rules and their processing, and manually tuned the FIS to predict the dynamics of individual proteins. In stage three, we employed Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) for optimising the FIS to further enhance prediction accuracy. Systems dynamics simulation results of the optimised FIS models were in close agreement with the benchmark ODE model results. The results show that the FIS models provide a close approximation to the comprehensive benchmark model in robustly representing continuous protein dynamics while representing the control of protein behavior in an intuitive and transparent format without requiring kinetic parameters. Therefore, FIS models can be an alternative to ODEs in network modelling. Further, FIS models can be assembled to develop large complex systems without losing information or accuracy.					samarasinghe, sandhya/O-9809-2018	samarasinghe, sandhya/0000-0003-2943-4331													0303-2647	1872-8324				FEB	2023	224								104826	10.1016/j.biosystems.2023.104826	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2023.104826		JAN 2023						36610587					WOS:000922542300001

In most studies, independent variables have been studied as qualitative dichotomous variables, and results of using discrete and continuous quantitative, ordinal, or multinomial categorical predictive variables in these models are not well understood in comparison to conventional models. Objectives: This study was designed and conducted to examine the application of these models in order to determine the survival of gastric cancer patients, in comparison to the Cox proportional hazards model. Patients and Methods: We studied the postoperative survival of 330 gastric cancer patients who suffered surgery at a surgical unit of the Iran Cancer Institute over a five-year period. Covariates of age, gender, history of substance abuse, cancer site, type of pathology, presence of metastasis, stage, and number of complementary treatments were entered in the models, and survival probabilities were calculated at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months using the Cox proportional hazards and neural network models. We estimated coefficients of the Cox model and the weights in the neural network (with 3, 5, and 7 nodes in the hidden layer) in the training group, and used them to derive predictions in the study group. Predictions with these two methods were compared with those of the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator as the gold standard. Comparisons were performed with the Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Survival probabilities at different times were determined using the Cox proportional hazards and a neural network with three nodes in the hidden layer; the ratios of standard errors with these two methods to the Kaplan-Meier method were 1.1593 and 1.0071, respectively, revealed a significant difference between Cox and Kaplan-Meier (P < 0.05) and no significant difference between Cox and the neural network, and the neural network and the standard (Kaplan-Meier), as well as better accuracy for the neural network (with 3 nodes in the hidden layer). Probabilities of survival were calculated using three neural network models with 3, 5, and 7 nodes in the hidden layer, and it has been observed that none of the predictions was significantly different from results with the Kaplan-Meier method and they appeared more comparable towards the last months (fifth year). However, we observed better accuracy using the neural network with 5 nodes in the hidden layer. Using the Cox proportional hazards and a neural network with 3 nodes in the hidden layer, we found enhanced accuracy with the neural network model. Conclusions: Neural networks can provide more accurate predictions for survival probabilities compared to the Cox proportional hazards mode, especially now that advances in computer sciences have eliminated limitations associated with complex computations. It is not recommended in order to adding too many hidden layer nodes because sample size related effects can reduce the accuracy. We recommend increasing the number of nodes to a point that increased accuracy continues (decrease in mean standard error), however increasing nodes should cease when a change in this trend is observed.

Closed-loop neurostimulation for the treatment of psychiatric disorders	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY												Despite increasing prevalence and huge personal and societal burden, psychiatric diseases still lack treatments which can control symptoms for a large fraction of patients. Increasing insight into the neurobiology underlying these diseases has demonstrated wide-ranging aberrant activity and functioning in multiple brain circuits and networks. Together with varied presentation and symptoms, this makes one-size-fits-all treatment a challenge. There has been a resurgence of interest in the use of neurostimulation as a treatment for psychiatric diseases. Initial studies using continuous open-loop stimulation, in which clinicians adjusted stimulation parameters during patient visits, showed promise but also mixed results. Given the periodic nature and fluctuations of symptoms often observed in psychiatric illnesses, the use of device-driven closed-loop stimulation may provide more effective therapy. The use of a biomarker, which is correlated with specific symptoms, to deliver stimulation only during symptomatic periods allows for the personalized therapy needed for such heterogeneous disorders. Here, we provide the reader with background motivating the use of closed-loop neurostimulation for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. We review foundational studies of open- and closed-loop neurostimulation for neuropsychiatric indications, focusing on deep brain stimulation, and discuss key considerations when designing and implementing closed-loop neurostimulation.

To develop energy efficient reactors, microheater is chosen as the heating source for microreactor which consume less power than the conventional heating elements. Using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) the effects of the biodiesel process variables was analyzed: catalyst concentration (0.5-2.5 wt.%), reaction temperature (35-55 degrees C), flow rate (5-25 mL/min), oil to methanol molar ratio (1:6-1:18), and power supplied to the microheater (15-35 W). To observe more than set limit, Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and VIKOR were used to evaluate the optimum conditions. Under the optimum conditions of 20 mL/min flow rate, 45 degrees C reaction temperature, 1.5 wt.% catalyst concentration, 1:9 oil to methanol molar ratio, and 20 W power supplied, the maximum biodiesel yield for microreactor with microheater is 91.1 %. Using ultrasonic mixing additionally for microreactor with microheater had maximum yield of 94.4 % under the optimum conditions.

Virtual Cell Clustering with Optimal Resource Allocation to Maximize Cellular System Capacity	2019 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)	IEEE Global Communications Conference				IEEE Global Communications Conference (IEEE GLOBECOM)	DEC 09-13, 2019	Waikoloa, HI	IEEE, Huawei, Intel, ZTE, Google, Qualcomm, Natl Instruments, IEEE Commun Soc				This work presents a new optimization framework for cellular networks using neighborhood-based optimization. Under this optimization framework, resources are allocated within virtual cells encompassing several base-stations and the users within their coverage areas. We form the virtual cells using hierarchical clustering with a minimax linkage criterion given a particular number of such cells. Once the virtual cells are formed, we consider a single-user detection interference coordination model in which base-stations in a virtual cell jointly allocate the channels and power to users within the virtual cell. We propose two new schemes for solving this mixed integer NP-hard resource allocation problem. The first scheme transforms the problem into a continuous variables problem; the second scheme proposes a new channel allocation method and then alternately solves the channel allocation problem using this new method, and the power allocation problem. We evaluate the average system sum rate of these schemes for a variable number of virtual cells. These results quantify the sum-rate along a continuum of fully-centralized versus fully-distributed optimization for different clustering and resource allocation strategies. These results indicate that the penalty of fully-distributed optimization versus fully-centralized (cloud RAN) can be as high as 50%. However, if designed properly, a few base stations within a virtual cell using neighborhood-based optimization have almost the same performance as fully-centralized optimization.																			2334-0983	2576-6813	978-1-7281-0962-6				2019										10.1109/globecom38437.2019.9014051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/globecom38437.2019.9014051													WOS:000552238604159

Specifically, a super network topology is presented to signify the modal interactions. Then, the generalized cost formulas of each type of links in the super network are defined. And based on the above formulas a bi-objective programming model is proposed to minimize the network operation cost and construction cost with traffic flow equilibrium constraints, investment constraints and expansion constraints. Moreover, a hybrid heuristic algorithm that combines the minimum cost flow algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm is presented to solve the proposed model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is evaluated through two numerical tests: a simple test network and an actual multimodal transport network.

Dynamic penalty function as a strategy in solving water resources combinatorial optimization problems with honey-bee mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												Because of the complexity of some optimization problems, evolutionary and meta-heuristic algorithms are sometimes more applicable than the traditional optimization methods. Some difficulties in solving design-operation problems in the field of engineering are due to the multimodality of the solution region of these problems. Since the design variables usually are specified as discrete variables and other continuous decision variables have to be set according to the range of the discrete ones, the possibility of trapping the final solution into some local optimum increases. In such cases, the capability of both traditional and evolutionary algorithms decreases. Thus, the development of a strategy to overcome this problem is the subject of this paper. For water utilities, one of the greatest potential areas for energy cost-savings is the scheduling of daily pump operations. Optimum design operation of pumping stations is a potential problem in this area that performs a wide background of solutions to this problem with different methods. Computation in all methods is driven by an objective function that includes operating and capital costs subject to various performances and hydraulic constraints. This paper achieves the optimal control and operation of an irrigation pumping station system by one of the latest tools used in optimization problems, which is the honey-bees mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm and is tested with a practical design. The HBMO algorithm with dynamic penalty function is presented and compared with two other well-known optimization tools which are the Lagrange multipliers (LM) method and genetic algorithms (GA) as well as with the previous results of the HBMO algorithm with constant penalty function for the same problem. The LM, GA and HBMO approaches simultaneously determine the least total annual cost of the pumping station and its operation. The solution includes the selection of pump type, capacity and the number of units, as well as scheduling the operation of irrigation pumps that results in minimum design and operating cost for a set of water demand curves. In this paper, the HBMO algorithm is applied and the dynamic penalty function is tested to demonstrate the efficiency of this combination simultaneously. The results are very promising and prove the ability of combining the dynamic penalty function with the HBMO algorithm for solving combinatorial design-operation optimization problems. Application of all these models to a real-world project shows not only considerable savings in cost and energy but also highlights the efficiency and capability of the dynamic penalty function in the HBMO algorithm for solving complex problems of this type.

Simultaneous measurement of reactions in microdroplets filled by concentration gradients	LAB ON A CHIP												This work describes a technology for performing and monitoring simultaneously several reactions confined in strings of microdroplets having identical volumes but different composition, and travelling with the same speed in parallel channels of a microfluidic device. This technology, called parallel microdroplets technology (P mu D), uses an inverted optical microscope and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to collect images and analyze them so as to report on the reactions occurring in these microdroplets. A concentration gradient of one reactant is created in the microfluidic device. In each channel, a different concentration of this reactant is mixed with a fixed amount of a second reactant. Using planar flow-focusing methodology, these mixtures are confined in microdroplets of pL size which travel in oil as continuous medium, avoiding laminar dispersion. By analyzing the images of parallel strings of microdroplets, the time courses of several reactions with different reagent compositions are investigated simultaneously. In order to design the microfluidic device that consists in a complex network of channels having well-defined geometries and restricted positions, the theoretical concept of equivalent channels (i.e. channels having identical hydraulic resistance) is exploited and developed. As a demonstration of the P mu D technology, an enzyme activity assay was carried out and the steady-state kinetic constants were determined.

An Adaptive Fuzzy Logic Control Strategy for Performance Enhancement of a Grid-Connected PMSG-Based Wind Turbine	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS												Wind power installations are rapidly increasing worldwide, leading to a huge level of permeation into electricity supply networks. Enormous efforts are spent to improve the performance of the wind turbine generator systems. This paper proposes a novel adaptive fuzzy logic control strategy for performance improvement of a grid-tied wind generator system. The variable-speed wind turbine driven permanent-magnet synchronous generator is tied to the electricity network by a full-capacity power converter. A cascaded adaptive fuzzy logic control strategy is proposed as the control methodology for the generator- and the grid-side converter/inverter. The adaptive technique depends on a continuous mixed p-norm algorithm, which on-line updates the scaling factors of the fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) at a high convergence speed. For the sake of preciseness, real wind speed data measured in the Za-afarana wind farm, Egypt, are considered in the analyses. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive FLC is compared to that achieved using particle swarm optimization algorithm based an optimal proportional-integral controller, considering severe grid disturbances. Extensive simulation analyses, which are done using MATLAB/Simulink software, are presented to validate the efficiency of the adaptive fuzzy logic control strategy.

To address the problem, a flexible energy transfer strategy for integrated electric-hydrogen systems with hydrogen vessels (HVs) is proposed in this paper. First, the continuous adjustability of working time (i.e., transiting and berthing time) of HVs is reasonably modelled without relying on fixed scheduling step. Meanwhile, both the controllability of the transmission line components and the role of overlying ice in enhancing the line thermal stability are analyzed. Additionally, a value assessment model for flexible energy transfer is developed which considers time-related fees (e.g., HV berthing fees) and frequency-related fees (e.g., HV tying/untying fees) of hydrogen transportation, the melting ice value of line power heating, power reserve costs and generation costs. On this basis, an energy scheduling strategy is designed for integrated electric-hydrogen systems to minimize daily operating costs. This scheduling model is first linearized as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and then solved efficiently using decomposition method. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE-RTS79 power system and river network in Jiangsu Province verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.																			0306-2619	1872-9118				AUG 1	2024	367								123401	10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.123401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.123401													WOS:001242224400001
J	Ko, KC; Egbelu, PJ				Ko, KC; Egbelu, PJ			Unidirectional AGV guidepath network design: a heuristic algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH												In an AGV system, the design of the guidepath network is one of the most important factors that determine the system effectiveness. Many alternative guidepath design schema have been introduced in the literature. However, the methods generally address the static production environment where the product mix or machine routings are assumed to be stable over time. In today's dynamic production systems with small lot sizes and short product cycles, the assumption of an unchanging product mix over an extended period is unrealistic in some situations. Considerable system inefficiency can be introduced when a network designed under the assumption of a stable product mix is used when indeed the product mix has changed. To avoid this kind of hidden source of inefficiency, what is needed is a tool that can recognize when a previously designed network is inappropriate for a new product mix and then uses the new product routing information to reconfigure a new network appropriate for the new production condition. A heuristic algorithm for the design of AGV guidepath in an environment with changing product mix is proposed here. The algorithm not only makes it possible to adapt the system network as the product mix changes, but also produces new designs at reasonably short computational time.																			0020-7543					JUL	2003	41	10					2325	2343		10.1080/0020754031000087201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0020754031000087201													WOS:000183540300011

Several methods have been discussed to avoid adverse impacts of EVs on power distribution grids. This paper presents a novel idea of charging EVs from surplus capacity available at AC rail traction substations. These feeders are normally designed for much higher capacity than is required to ensure continuous trains operation even in the event of a substation power outage. Separate single-phase and three-phase EV charging grids are proposed in which single-phase chargers are fed by single-phase transformers directly connected to traction supply, while three-phase chargers are fed by a power electronic converter involving a back to back connection of a single-phase and a three-phase voltage source converter (VSC). This results in reduced capital and running costs. A backup battery is also used to supply the chargers when traction supply does not have capacity to fully feed the EVs' charging demand. Therefore, an energy management system is required to ensure that the converter feeds the single-phase chargers while maintaining the power quality on the three-phase grid. The system is modelled in MATLAB/Simulink and simulation results are presented to confirm the method effectiveness.

Both problems were represented by means of a mathematical model known as the Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model, and the objective function was the minimization of the total annual operating costs. The latter included the costs associated with energy losses, investment in conductors per network segment, and phase reconfiguration at each node in the system. To solve the problem addressed in this study, a master-slave methodology was implemented. The master stage employs a discrete version of the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) to determine the set of conductors to be installed in each line, as well as the set of connections per phase at each of the nodes that compose the system. Afterward, the slave stage uses the three-phase version of the backward/forward sweep power flow method to determine the value of the fitness function of each individual provided by the master stage. Compared to those of the Hurricane-based Optimization Algorithm (HOA) and the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), the numerical results obtained by the proposed solution methodology in the IEEE 8- and 25-node test systems demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness. All the numerical validations were performed in MATLAB.

Cyber-Physical System Demonstration of an Automated Shuttle-Conveyor-Belt Operation for Inventory Control of Multiple Stockpiles: A Proof of Concept	IEEE ACCESS												Smart manufacturing in the so-called Industry 4.0 age pushes the research and development of laboratory-scale proof of concepts before its deployment in pilots and real-size equipment. As such, we present a cyber-physical system (CPS) demonstration in the mining industry field engineered to autonomously manage the handling of solids flowing in a conveyor-belt that drops materials in containers, forming multiple stockpiles per belt. The CPS operates to control multiple stockpiles' inventories using mixed-integer optimization that minimizes the square deviation of the measured inventory to their targets (heights). Within the sensing-optimizing-actuating (SOA) cycle, the CPS demonstration is performed as follows. First, the sensing (data measurement, data processing, and system evaluation) uses a deep neural network in real-time to assess the level of materials stored in transparent containers. Second, the optimizing (mathematical programming, optimization techniques, and decision-making capabilities) is performed using a flowsheet network formulation called unit-operation-port-state superstructure (UOPSS) that permits a fast solution for the position-idle-time-varying discrete manipulated variables as operational schedules. Third, the actuating (cyber-physical integration) implements a physical actuation solution through an integrated CPS environment. According to the findings of our experimentation, stockpiling process control in a smart manufacturing context has enormous potentials to control multiple stockpiles' inventory autonomously.

Given its discrete nature and the large number of devices involved, a continuous approximation based on the Gram-Charlier series expansion of a truncated Gaussian kernel is proposed. We use this approximation to derive an analytic closed-form expression for the outage probability, corresponding to the event of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio being below a detection threshold. This metric is useful since it can be used for evaluating the performance of mMTC systems. We analyze, as an illustrative application of the previous approximation, a scenario with several multi-antenna collector nodes, each equipped with a set of predefined spatial beams. We consider two setups, namely single- and multiple-resource, in reference to the number of resources that are allocated to each beam. A graph-based approach that minimizes the average outage probability, and that is based on the statistics approximation, is used as allocation strategy. Finally, we describe an access protocol where the resource identifiers are broadcast (distributed) through the beams. Numerical simulations prove the accuracy of the approximations and the benefits of the allocation strategy.

Power Factor Improvement by Pulse Width Modulated Switched Single Capacitor	INDIA INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON POWER ELECTRONIC S					3rd India International Conference on Power Electronics	DEC 19-21, 2006	Chennai, INDIA	Numer Power Syst, IEEE PELS Soc, Assoc UPS Manufacturers, IEEE Madras Sect				Reactive power is recognized as an essential factor in the design and good operation of power system. Real and reactive power on a transmission line in an integrated network is governed by the line impedance, voltage magnitudes, the angle of differences at the line ends, and the role the line plays in maintaining network stability under dynamic contingencies. Reactive power compensation or control is essential part in a power system to minimize power transmission loss, to maximize power transmission capability, and to maintain the system voltage within desired level. In this paper a new method is proposed which improves the power factor automatically of varying lagging loads to unity, using one single large shunt capacitor instead of using a bank of switching capacitors. Basically, this control scheme is a static power factor correction method by continuous voltage or current control of a capacitor. In this work the voltage across the capacitor is being changed by a bi-directional switch to control the magnitude of compensating capacitor current and thereby attaining unity power factor. This system incorporates high-speed insulated gate bipolar transistor switching technology. The gate signal of the switching devices is generated by using a compact and commercially available IC chip SG1524B. The scheme is simple in this sense that it uses only one static bi-directional switch controlled by an electronic control circuit that uses only analog ICs and some discrete digital components.																					978-1-4244-3450-3				2006							212	+																WOS:000264583500040
J	Dhingra, S; Kumar, D				Dhingra, Sakshi; Kumar, Dharminder			Hyperspectral image classification using meta-heuristics and artificial neural network	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES												Hyperspectral images usually comprise several continuous spectral bands that represent the category of similar objects or material within the captured scene. These high-dimensional data structures have a high level of correlation and possess unique information that can be used for precise image classification. The precise selection of useful features from these high dimensional band information is very important to reduce the challenge of hyper spectral image classification approaches. Nowadays, metaheuristic algorithms are immensely utilized as a promising tool for hyperspectral image classification. In the present research work, hyperspectral images are classified with the various combinations of meta-heuristic approaches and the neural network including the mostly used Cuckoo Search (CS) optimization algorithm to resolve the global optimization search problems considering the improvement needed in image classification. Further, the strength of CS is improved using the integration of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) fitness function within the CS. The feature selection is performed by the hybrid CS and GA algorithm and the optimized features are then fed to ANN for training and classification. The paper has shown a comparative analysis of various meta heuristics techniques with ANN on parameters like kappa coefficient, Class accuracy and overall Accuracy and the designed algorithms are tested on the Indian Pines dataset. The proposed CS and GA with ANN outperformed the two already existing works with an overall average accuracy of 97.30% and a kappa coefficient of 0.9760.																			0252-2667	2169-0103				NOV 17	2022	43	8					2167	2179		10.1080/02522667.2022.2133222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02522667.2022.2133222													WOS:000900147900023

We consider a busy farming season divided into several time periods in which the problem is to determine where to locate temporary maintenance stations (TMSs) as well as identifying how many capacitated service-providing facilities to allocate to each TMS to satisfy maintenance demands. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer program (MIP) that seeks to minimize the total service mileage between TMSs and demand points. Additionally, considering that the service flow from a TMS to a demand point in this type of work takes place between potential district locations rather than discrete vertices, we use regional contiguity constraints to enforce agricultural production areas served by a TMS as geographically connected. To solve our MIP problem, an exact algorithm based on Benders decomposition is then developed along with several refinements. Lastly, our model and methodology are illustrated in the handling of a real-world problem in China. Computational results are presented that analyze the optimized facility location-allocation plan, examine the impact of selected parameters, demonstrate the advantage of implementing the contiguity constraints and discuss the performance of solution algorithm.

Complex 1 possesses a discrete dinuclear metallamacrocyclic structure. Complex 2 is a 1D homochiral helical coordination polymer that is built from achiral components, whereas 3 displays a 1 D helical chain structure. 4 is an unusual 2D double-layered structure generated by pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions of two 2D networks. The structural differences of these complexes are mainly due to the differences of the size of the rigid aromatic chelate ligands and d(10) metal ions. It appears that the chelate ligands and metal ions of the larger size favor the formation of high-dimensional structures, whereas those of the smaller size favor the formation of low-dimensional structures in the present system.

J	Langroodi, AK; Nahvi, A				Langroodi, Armin Kassemi; Nahvi, Ali			Design and Implementation of a Hybrid Fuzzy-Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Driver Drowsiness Detection Using a Driving Simulator	SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLES												Driver drowsiness is the cause of many fatal accidents all over the world. Many research works have been conducted on detecting driver drowsiness for more than half a century, but statistical data show that such accidents have not decreased significantly. Most researchers have focused on using certain sensors and extracting their relevant features. However, there has been no research work on developing an algorithm to detect driver drowsiness independently from the input type. In this paper, a hybrid fuzzy-reinforcement learning drowsiness detection algorithm is presented. This algorithm is flexible to work with any number and any kind of data related to driver alertness. It estimates the level of alertness based on an arbitrary number of inputs. The algorithm extracts driving patterns specific to each driver and determines driver's level of drowsiness using a continuous numerical variable rather than a discrete variable. To evaluate the algorithm, only six features related to only steering wheel angle and velocity are used. The accuracy of the user-specific data is 81.1% validated with the Observer Rating of Drowsiness criterion. This hybrid fuzzy-reinforcement learning algorithm has 46.4% improvement over the artificial neural network user-specific dataset method, and 49.2% over the artificial neural network general dataset method. The results can be improved even further if we use more features related to the driver and the vehicle.																			1946-391X	1946-3928				MAR	2018	11	1					57	64		10.4271/02-11-01-0005	http://dx.doi.org/10.4271/02-11-01-0005													WOS:000453013800005
J	Liang, S; Yin, MH; Sun, G; Li, JH				Liang, Shuang; Yin, Minghao; Sun, Geng; Li, Jiahui			Multiobjective Optimization Approach for Reducing Hovering and Motion Energy Consumptions in UAV-Assisted Collaborative Beamforming	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL												Communications and networks of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are of paramount importance, owing to their flexible mobility and fast deployment. However, how to enhance the communication efficiency under the restricted on-board energy and transmit power is still one of the most critical problems. In this article, we consider a UAV-assisted communication scenario, in which a virtual antenna array (VAA) performed by a swarm of UAVs utilize collaborative beamforming (CB) to communicate with several faraway base stations (BSs). For achieving a superior transmission performance, we formulate a hovering and motion energy consumption multiobjective optimization problem (HMECMOP) of UAV-assisted CB to simultaneously minimize the total hovering and motion energy consumptions of UAVs by jointly optimizing the positions, excitation current weights of UAVs, and the order of communicating with different BSs. Moreover, the formulated HMECMOP is analyzed and proven as an NP-hard and classical hybrid multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) with a complex solution vector that contains continuous and discrete variables. Thus, we propose an improved multiobjective multiverse optimizer (IMOMVO), which uses the vertical and horizontal renewal strategy and nearest neighbor procedure (NNP) to solve the complex HMECMOP. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption of UAVs communicating with multiple remote BSs so that improving the communication performance.

J	Sefer, E; Kingsford, C				Sefer, Emre; Kingsford, Carl			Diffusion archeology for diffusion progression history reconstruction	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS												Diffusion through graphs can be used to model many real-world processes, such as the spread of diseases, social network memes, computer viruses, or water contaminants. Often, a real-world diffusion cannot be directly observed, while it is occurring-perhaps it is not noticed until some time has passed, continuous monitoring is too costly, or privacy concerns limit data access. This leads to the need to reconstruct how the present state of the diffusion came to be from partial diffusion data. Here, we tackle the problem of reconstructing a diffusion history from one or more snapshots of the diffusion state. This ability can be invaluable to learn when certain computer nodes are infected or which people are the initial disease spreaders to control future diffusions. We formulate this problem over discrete-time SEIRS-type diffusion models in terms of maximum likelihood. We design methods that are based on submodularity and a novel Prize Collecting Dominating Set Vertex cover relaxation that can identify likely diffusion steps with some provable performance guarantees. Our methods are the first to be able to reconstruct complete diffusion histories accurately in real and simulated situations. As a special case, they can also identify the initial spreaders better than the existing methods for that problem. Our results for both meme and contaminant diffusion show that the partial diffusion data problem can be overcome with proper modeling and methods, and that hidden temporal characteristics of diffusion can be predicted from limited data.					sefer, emre/AAY-2245-2020	sefer, emre/0000-0002-9186-0270													0219-1377	0219-3116				NOV	2016	49	2					403	427		10.1007/s10115-015-0904-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10115-015-0904-x								27821901					WOS:000385190100001

However, the increasing availability of big data is a challenge for transforming a city into a smart one. Conventional statistics and econometric methods may not work well with big data. One promising direction is to leverage advanced machine learning tools in analyzing big data about cities. In this paper, the authors propose a model to learn region embedding. The learned embedding can be used for more accurate prediction by representing discrete variables as continuous vectors that encode the meaning of a region. Design/methodology/approach The authors use the random walk and skip-gram methods to learn embedding and update the preliminary embedding generated by graph convolutional network (GCN). The authors apply this model to a real-world dataset from Manhattan, New York, and use the learned embedding for crime event prediction. Findings This study's results show that the proposed model can learn multi-dimensional city data more accurately. Thus, it facilitates cities to transform themselves into smarter ones that are more sustainable and efficient. Originality/value The authors propose an embedding model that can learn multi-dimensional city data for improving predictive analytics and urban operations. This model can learn more dimensions of city data, reduce the amount of computation and leverage distributed computing for smart city development and transformation.

In this problem, each session connects via a single path a source and a destination, and its goal is to maximize its assigned transmission rate (i.e., its throughput). Since the links of the network have limited bandwidths, some criterion has to be defined to fairly distribute their capacity among the sessions. A popular criterion is max-min fairness that, in short, guarantees that each session i gets a rate lambda(i) such that no session s can increase lambda(s) without causing another session s' to end up with a rate lambda(s') < lambda(s). Many max-min fair algorithms have been proposed, both centralized and distributed. However, to our knowledge, all proposed distributed algorithms require control data being continuously transmitted to recompute the max-min fair rates when needed (because none of them has mechanisms to detect convergence to the max-min fair rates). In this paper we propose B-Neck, a distributed max-min fair algorithm that is also quiescent. This means that, in absence of changes (i. e., session arrivals or departures), once the max-min rates have been computed, B-Neck stops generating network traffic. Quiescence is a key design concept of B-Neck, because B-Neck routers are capable of detecting and notifying changes in the convergence conditions of max-min fair rates. As far as we know, B-Neck is the first distributed max-min fair algorithm that does not require a continuous injection of control traffic to compute the rates.

J	Hu, XM; Huang, L; Zeng, J; Wang, KP; Wang, Y				Hu, Xuemei; Huang, Lan; Zeng, Jia; Wang, Kangping; Wang, Yan			EGFA-NAS: a neural architecture search method based on explosion gravitation field algorithm	COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS												Neural architecture search (NAS) is an extremely complex optimization task. Recently, population-based optimization algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithm, have been adopted as search strategies for designing neural networks automatically. Various population-based NAS methods are promising in searching for high-performance neural architectures. The explosion gravitation field algorithm (EGFA) inspired by the formation process of planets is a novel population-based optimization algorithm with excellent global optimization capability and remarkable efficiency, compared with the classical population-based algorithms, such as GA and PSO. Thus, this paper attempts to develop a more efficient NAS method, called EGFA-NAS, by utilizing the work mechanisms of EGFA, which relaxes the search discrete space to a continuous one and then utilizes EGFA and gradient descent to optimize the weights of the candidate architectures in conjunction. To reduce the computational cost, a training strategy by utilizing the population mechanism of EGFA-NAS is proposed. In addition, a weight inheritance strategy for the new generated dust individuals is proposed during the explosion operation to improve performance and efficiency. The performance of EGFA-NAS is investigated in two typical micro search spaces: NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS, and compared with various kinds of state-of-the-art NAS competitors. The experimental results demonstrate that EGFA-NAS is able to match or outperform the state-of-the-art NAS methods on image classification tasks with remarkable efficiency improvement.

Remote sensing technology has provided an effective way to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of inundation. Remotely sensed images with high temporal resolutions are widely used in mapping inundation. However, mixed pixels do exist due to their relatively low spatial resolutions. One of the most popular approaches to resolve this issue is sub-pixel mapping. In this paper, a novel discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) based sub-pixel flood inundation mapping (DPSO-SFIM) method is proposed to achieve an improved accuracy in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale. The evaluation criterion for sub-pixel inundation mapping is formulated. The DPSO-SFIM algorithm is developed, including particle discrete encoding, fitness function designing and swarm search strategy. The accuracy of DPSO-SFIM in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale was evaluated using Landsat ETM + images from study areas in Australia and China. The results show that DPSO-SFIM consistently outperformed the four traditional SEIM methods in these study areas. A sensitivity analysis of DPSO-SFIM was also carried out to evaluate its performances. It is hoped that the results of this study will enhance the application of medium-low spatial resolution images in inundation detection and mapping, and thereby support the ecological and environmental studies of river basins.

The ORM tracking problem is of significant interest in practice since, with a linear ORM, the closed-loop control system is indirectly feedback linearized and value iteration (VI) offers the means to achieve ORM tracking without using process dynamics. Ranging from linear to nonlinear parameterizations, a successful approximate VI implementation for continuous state-action spaces depends on several key parameters such as: problem dimension, exploration of the state-action space, the state-transitions dataset size, and suitable selection of the function approximators. We show that using the same transitions dataset and under a general linear parameterization of the Q-function, high performance ORM tracking can be achieved with an approximate VI scheme, on the same performance level as that of a neural-network (NN)-based implementation that is more complex and takes significantly more time to learn. However, the latter proves to be more robust to hyperparameters selection, dataset size, and to exploration strategies, recommending it as the de facto practical implementation. The case study is aimed at ORM tracking of a real-world nonlinear two inputs-two outputs aerodynamic process with ten internal states, as a representative high order system.

The aim of this study was to propose this kind of solution. It enables the accurate assessment of vocal nodules in children while measuring glottal insufficiency. The input data includes voice and electroglottographic recordings of patients' voices as well as diagnoses made by practitioners. The recordings were parameterized and used to develop a classifier to assess glottal insufficiency of vocal nodules. The classifier was designed with the help of a genetic algorithm. The diagnoses established thanks to the classifier show a 92% agreement with those reached through medical examination. Such effective performance renders the classifier a useful noninvasive screening tool. We compared our method with Deep Neural Network classifier and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) evolutionary algorithm. The solution that we propose offers a more accurate continuous diagnosis in comparison with the discrete diagnosis of a deep neural network as well as greater accuracy in relation to the CMA-ES algorithm. Another advantage of the proposed solution is the ease with which it can be implemented by healthcare professionals. A Visual Basic for the Applications (VBA) code for Libre Office macro for the classifier is attached at the end of this paper.

J	Chen, HL; Doty, D; Reeves, W; Soloveichik, D				Chen, Ho-Lin; Doty, David; Reeves, Wyatt; Soloveichik, David			Rate-independent Computation in Continuous Chemical Reaction Networks	JOURNAL OF THE ACM												Understanding the algorithmic behaviors that are in principle realizable in a chemical system is necessary for a rigorous understanding of the design principles of biological regulatory networks. Further, advances in synthetic biology herald the time when we will be able to rationally engineer complex chemical systems and when idealized formal models will become blueprints for engineering. Coupled chemical interactions in a well-mixed solution are commonly formalized as chemical reaction networks (CRNs). However, despite the widespread use of CRNs in the natural sciences, the range of computational behaviors exhibited by CRNs is not well understood. Here, we study the following problem: What functions f : R-k -> R can be computed by a CRN, in which the CRN eventually produces the correct amount of the "output" molecule, no matter the rate at which reactions proceed? This captures a previously unexplored but very natural class of computations: For example, the reaction X-1 + X-2 -> Y can be thought to compute the function y = min(x(1), x(2)). Such a CRN is robust in the sense that it is correct whether its evolution is governed by the standard model of mass-action kinetics, alternatives such as Hill-function or Michaelis-Menten kinetics, or other arbitrary models of chemistry that respect the (fundamentally digital) stoichiometric constraints (what are the reactants and products?). We develop a reachability relation based on a broad notion of "what could happen" if reaction rates can vary arbitrarily over time. Using reachability, we define stable computation analogously to probability 1 computation in distributed computing and connect it with a seemingly stronger notion of rate-independent computation based on convergence in the limit t -> 8 under a wide class of generalized rate laws. Besides the direct mapping of a concentration to a nonnegative analog value, we also consider the "dual-rail representation" that can represent negative values as the difference of two concentrations and allows the composition of CRN modules. We prove that a function is rate-independently computable if and only if it is piecewise linear (with rational coefficients) and continuous (dual-rail representation), or non-negative with discontinuities occurring only when some inputs switch fromzero to positive (direct representation). Themany contexts where continuous piecewise linear functions are powerful targets for implementation, combined with the systematic construction we develop for computing these functions, demonstrate the potential of rate-independent chemical computation.					; Doty, David/B-3203-2017	HO-LIN, CHEN/0000-0002-6171-9962; Doty, David/0000-0002-3922-172X; Reeves, Wyatt/0009-0008-9871-3020; Soloveichik, David/0000-0002-2585-4120													0004-5411	1557-735X				JUN	2023	70	3							22	10.1145/3590776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3590776													WOS:001006213100005

Random numbers are used in many cryptographic protocols, key management, identity authentication, image encryption, and so on. True random numbers (TRNs) have better randomness and unpredictability in encryption and key than pseudorandom numbers (PRNs). Chaos has good features of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, randomness, periodicity, and reproduction. These demands coincide with the rise of TRNs generating approaches in chaos Zeld. This survey paper intends to provide a systematic review of true random number generators (TRNGs) based on chaos. Firstly, the two kinds of popular chaotic systems for generating TRNs based on chaos, including continuous time chaotic system and discrete time chaotic system are introduced. The main approaches and challenges are exposed to help researchers decide which are the ones that best suit their needs and goals. Then, existing methods are reviewed, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the Zeld. We also devote a part of the paper to review TRNGs based on current-mode chaos for this problem. Finally, quantitative results are given for the described methods in which they were evaluated, following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the art of TRNGs based on chaos.

An Integrated Modeling Framework for Infrastructure System-of-systems Simulation	2013 7TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (SYSCON 2013)	Annual IEEE Systems Conference				7th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)	APR 15-18, 2013	Orlando, FL	IEEE				Design of future hard infrastructure must consider emergent behaviors from cross-system interdependencies. Understanding these interdependencies is challenging due to high levels of integration in high-performance systems and their operation as a collaborative system-of-systems managed by multiple organizations. Existing modeling frameworks have limitations for strategic planning either because important spatial structure attributes have been abstracted out or behavioral models are oriented to shorter-term analysis with a static network structure. This paper presents a formal modeling framework as a first step to integrating infrastructure system models in a system-of-systems simulation addressing these concerns. First, a graph-theoretic structural framework captures the spatial dimension of physical infrastructure. An element's simulation state includes location, parent, resource contents, and operational state properties. Second, a functional behavioral framework captures the temporal dimension of infrastructure operations at a level suitable for strategic analysis. Resource behaviors determine the flow of resources into or out of nodes and element behaviors modify other state including the network structure. Two application use cases illustrate the usefulness of the modeling framework in varying contexts. The first case applies the framework to future space exploration infrastructure with an emphasis on mobile system elements and discrete resource flows. The second case applies the framework to infrastructure investment in Saudi Arabia with an emphasis on immobile system elements aggregated at the city level and continuous resource flows. Finally, conclusions present future work planned for implementing the framework in a simulation software tool.

For instance, successful reconstructions of transient and turbulent flames will assist in understanding the complex combustion mechanisms during combustion and advanced burner design. The most common method for volumetric flame combustion diagnosis is the tomographic reconstruction technique. Originating from computed tomography for medical diagnosis purposes, computed tomography of chemiluminescence (CTC) is a volumetric flame diagnostic method that utilizes two-dimensional projections of flame under limited viewing angles to reconstruct three-dimensional information of the combustion field. Typical flame reconstructions use discrete volumetric voxels to represent the flame luminosities at different spatial locations. However, this approach increases the computation costs in both weight matrix calculations and tomographic iterations. This investigation proposes a neural volume reconstruction technique (NVRT) that uses a neural network to represent the continuous flame luminosity implicitly. Besides, this investigation adopts the differentiable volume rendering (DVR) technique to train the network based on two-dimensional flame projections and does not require 3D supervision. We use both simulated flames and experimental flames to verify the capability of the proposed NVRT method against the traditional algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). Results show that the NVRT method is superior to the ART method in reconstruction fidelity, resistance to noise, and computational cost (especially RAM usage) for flame reconstructions.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, evidence-based recommendations on which type of exercise is most suitable for each individual are still lacking. Therefore, we conduct a network meta-analysis to assess the relative efficacy of aerobic and mind-body exercise on motor function and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and to determine which of these therapies are the most suitable. Design: A network meta-analysis and dose-response analysis. Setting and Participants: Medline, Embase (all via Ovid), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were comprehensively searched for related trials through April 2021. Measurements: Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The effect sizes of continuous outcomes were calculated using mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs). A network meta-analysis with a frequentist approach was conducted to estimate the efficacy and probability rankings of the therapies. The dose-response relationship was determined based on metaregression and SUCRA. Results: Fifty-two trials with 1971 patients evaluating six different therapies were identified. For the UPDRS-motor score and TUG score, yoga all ranked highest (SUCRA = 92.8%, 92.6%, respectively). The SUCRA indicated that walking may best improve the BBS score (SUCRA = 90.2%). Depression, cognitive and activities of daily living scores were significantly improved by yoga (SUCRA: 86.3, 95.1, and 79.5%, respectively). In the dose-response analysis, 60-min sessions, two times a week might be the most suitable dose of yoga for reducing the UPDRS-motor score of PD patients. Conclusion: Yoga and walking are important options for increasing functional mobility and balance function, and yoga might be particularly effective for decreasing depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment and improving activities of daily living in PD. The potential optimal dose of yoga for enhancing motor ability in PD patients is 60-min sessions, two times a week. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42021224823.

Measuring the biophysical properties, such as leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll (Cab) content, is the key to properly following the growth cycle of crops. In this perspective, we propose an innovative approach for monitoring landscape-scale biophysical properties of wheat and barley field crops using Sentinel-2 time-series imagery based on accurate 3-D direct and inverse radiative transfer modeling. It relies on an original 3-D radiative transfer models (RTM) emulator architecture based on a residual artificial neural network (ResNet). We employed the well-known discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate Sentinel-2 images and generate a database that serves to train and validate the ResNet emulator. To do it, two realistic mockups, both composed of soil and 3-D wheat plants, are set up. The first mockup mimics the wheat and barley from their start of growth to their full growth, and the second reproduces the features of the wheat and barley plant when they turn yellowish and mature for harvesting. Besides, we extract the bare soil spectra signature from Sentinel-2 images acquired before sowing. Results of the proposed emulator show its similarity to DART simulation while it is much faster. These emulator features make it possible to adapt an inversion technique based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), specifically, as a novelty, a continuous MCMC. The latter exploits the emulator to perform the iterative sampling processing on all continuous values in allowed intervals according to each sought biophysical property until converging to its respective posterior distribution. The proposed scheme of RTM emulator inversion based on continuous MCMC and using Sentinel-2 imagery is called "REMI." It ensures high retrieval performances, which reach an RMSE equal to 0.06 and 0.1 for LAI and Cab, respectively.

The controllers are designed for two reasons: 1) it is very difficult and almost impossible to only measure the in situ feedback information for the controllers and 2) the controllers may not always exist at any time.

J	Cetin, KS; Manuel, L; Novoselac, A				Cetin, Kristen S.; Manuel, Lance; Novoselac, Atila			Effect of technology-enabled time-of-use energy pricing on thermal comfort and energy use in mechanically-conditioned residential buildings in cooling dominated climates	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT												The effects of automatic indoor set point temperature setbacks using smart thermostats in response to time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates structures on occupant thermal comfort are evaluated for representative single family residential buildings located in 3 climate zones with dominant cooling loads. Building energy models (BEM) of single family homes are evaluated using a full factorial experimental design to create a response surface which provides a continuous function to evaluate the impact of four design variables on long-term thermal comfort indices, including Average Percent of People Dissatisfied (Average PPD), and Percentage Outside Thermal Comfort Zone (POS). These design variables include indoor set point temperature, degrees of setback temperature in cooling mode, building thermal mass, and air exchange rate for each climate zone. These are compared to the relative energy savings resulting from TOU thermostat setbacks while considering other design variables. A second-order response surface is found to provide a reasonable fit to BEM simulation in- and out-of-sample data. The set point temperature is the most influential of the variables studied in decreasing long-term thermal comfort, while reducing HVAC electricity use. The thermostat setback has the strongest influence on thermal comfort in a hot-dry climate, while the most HVAC energy savings is able to be achieved in the mixed-humid climate zone. The results are tabulated for weighing the costs and benefits of TOU electricity rates for homes with different characteristics, in climate zones with air conditioning-dominate energy consumption.

Discrete networked dynamic systems with mode separation: state and output synchronization	JOURNAL OF DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS AND APPLICATIONS												This paper examines the impact of coupling in a class of linear discrete-time systems with mode separation over networks. We provide a complete analysis and design treatment allowing at extending the stabilization control design to the corresponding synchronization problem. We deploy a time-scale separation of the whole network dynamics to synthesize the controls that synchronize both the slow and fast states. We show that the design implementation is cast as feedback simultaneous stabilization framework and cast as feasibility problem over finite number of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As demonstrated by simulation studies, the ensuing results provide designers with a network-centric technique guarantee stability and enhance the performance of considered coupled systems.																			1023-6198	1563-5120				JUL 3	2021	27	7					986	1005		10.1080/10236198.2021.1954627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236198.2021.1954627		JUL 2021											WOS:000679911800001

Recently, learning-based methods have achieved promising performance by designing various convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most existing CNNs are based on a single feature branch and cannot fully utilize the low-frequency and high-frequency features of haze, which inevitably affects the quality of the restored image. To this end, we develop an effective Frequency-guidance Collaborative Triple-branch Network (FCT-Net) for image dehazing. It casts dehazing as a dual-frequency component restoration task and deals with pertinent features based on a triple-branch-like architecture. Specifically, our FCT-Net can be decomposed into four components: low-frequency branch (LFB), high-frequency branch (HFB), progressive fusion branch (PFB), and image reconstruction tail (IRT). The LFB aims to mine more contextual information with dual-path feature modulation block (DFMB), while the HFB aims to recover the missing structural detail via mixed attention residual block (MARB). PFB is a fusion branch built between LFB and HFB, where different feature streams (low-and high-frequency information) can be integrated together through continuous selective progressive fusion (SPF) modules. Finally, our IRT exploits all these derived features to generate the clear haze-free image. Furthermore, we utilize a multi-strategy loss to optimize our FCT-Net from the perspectives of pixel domain and feature domain, which can achieve better image recovery quality. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that our FCT-Net is able to get comparable results with other state-of-the-art methods.																			0141-9382	1872-7387				DEC	2023	80								102577	10.1016/j.displa.2023.102577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.displa.2023.102577		NOV 2023											WOS:001149827900001

Generalized delta rule (GDR) algorithm with generalized predictive control (GPC) for optimum temperature tracking of batch polymerization	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												The generalized delta rule (GDR) algorithm with generalized predictive control (GPC) control was implemented experimentally to track the temperature on a set point in a batch, jacketed polymerization reactor. An equation for optimal temperature was obtained by using co-state Hamiltonian and model equations. To track the calculated optimal temperature profiles, controller used should act smoothly and precisely as much as possible. Experimental application was achieved to obtain the desired comparison. In the design of this control system, the reactor filled with styrene-toluene mixture is considered as a heat exchanger. When the reactor is heated by means of an immersed heater, cooling water is passed through the reactor-cooling jacket. So the cooling water absorbs the heat given out by the heater. If this is taken into consideration, this reactor can be considered to be continuous in terms of energy. When such a mixing chamber was used as a polymer reactor with defined values of heat input and cooling flow rate, system can reach the steady-state condition. The heat released during the reaction was accepted as a disturbance for the heat exchanger. Heat input from the immersed heater is chosen as a manipulated variable. The neural network model based on the relation between the reactor temperature and heat input to the reactor is used. The performance results of GDR with GPC were compared with the results obtained by using nonlinear GPC with NARMAX model. The reactor temperature closely follows the optimal trajectory. And then molecular weight, experimental conversion and chain lengths are obtained for GDR with GPC. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two algorithms are proposed to design observers, able to recognise the state and the input of the system in finite time, without any requirement on the structure of the Boolean control network. It is shown that such procedures can be used, in a wholly probabilistic framework, to estimate the state and the input, even when random noise is superimposed to the available measures. The interest in these methods relies on biological applications, as, for instance, regulatory networks, where the state and the input of the system need to be estimated from scarce and noisy data.

The current study achieves the objective by modelling subjective discomfort for repetitive wrist flexion using controlled posture, pace and force. A three-level fractional factorial experiment was conducted involving repetitive wrist flexion (2 s/motion, 6 s/motion, 10 s/motion) from a neutral posture to a given angle (10 degrees, 28 degrees, 45 degrees) against a controlled resistance (5 N, 25 N, 50 N) using a Box Behnken design. Ten subjects participated. Discomfort was reported on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Results of response surface regression analysis revealed that main effects of force, wrist flexion angle, and repetition were all significant (p<0.05) and that no second-order effects were observed. Linear regression analysis on these factors established a discomfort model on which the filter characteristics were based. The pure error test model revealed no significant lack of fit (p > 0.05). The continuous model was compared and agreed with discrete psychophysical data from other published studies. The model was used for generating parameters for a force and frequency weighted digital filter that weighs continuous wrist postural signals with corresponding force in proportion to the equal discomfort function as a function of frequency of repetition. These filters will enable integration of large quantities of biomechanical data in field studies.

A sequence of stochastic variables obeying Bernoulli distribution is applied in the system model to describe the randomly occurring communication delays. The discrete-time system considered is also subject to parameter uncertainties and state-dependent stochastic disturbances. A novel discrete switching function is proposed to facilitate the sliding mode controller design. The sufficient conditions are derived by means of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. It is shown that the system dynamics in the specified sliding surface is robustly exponentially stable in the mean square if two LMIs with an equality constraint are feasible. A discrete-time SMC controller is designed that is capable of guaranteeing the discrete-time sliding-mode reaching condition of the specified sliding surface. Finally, a simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

First, a periodic event-triggered communication scheme and a networked filter error system model for networked H filtering are presented. In this scheme and model: (i) the sensor is time-triggered; (ii) the transmitter is event-triggered in a periodic manner; and (iii) the closed-loop system is modelled as a time-delay dependent filter error system. Second, under consideration of the proposed communication scheme, an H filtering analysis criterion and a stabilisation criterion are derived. Compared with those where the communication scheme and the filter must be individually designed in some existing ones, the communication and filtering parameters can be obtained simultaneously. In particular, a co-design algorithm is provided to obtain the communication and filtering parameters in a unified framework for using less network bandwidth. Finally, two examples are given to show the advantages of the proposed method.					peng, chen/HHS-8720-2022	peng, chen/0000-0003-3652-2233													1751-9675	1751-9683				OCT	2013	7	8					754	765		10.1049/iet-spr.2013.0033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-spr.2013.0033													WOS:000326459900013

The interaction matrix of network information is calculated by using a tensor neural network, and the semantic matching information of word granularity and sentence granularity at different levels is obtained, and the network information is extracted. The template network information is discretized, the similarity between the direction of the discrete gradient and the magnitude of the gradient is compared, and the representative gradient vector in the template is extracted to replace all the discrete points to match, so as to realize the fuzzy matching algorithm design of network information retrieval. The experimental results show that the fuzzy matching algorithm based on discrete mathematics has higher matching accuracy.																			2190-5509	2190-5517				2022 FEB 11	2022										10.1007/s13204-021-02190-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13204-021-02190-y		FEB 2022											WOS:000754146000006
J	de Nooy, W				de Nooy, Wouter			Networks of action and events over time. A multilevel discrete-time event history model for longitudinal network data	SOCIAL NETWORKS												Longitudinal network data recording the moment at which ties appear, change, or disappear are increasingly available. Event history models can be used to analyze the dynamics of time-stamped network data. This paper adapts the discrete-time event history model to social network data. A discrete-time event history model can easily incorporate a multilevel design and time-varying covariates. A multilevel design is needed to account for dependencies among ties and vertices, which should not be ignored in a small longitudinal network. Time-varying covariates are required to analyze network effects, that is, the impact of previous ties. In addition, a discrete-time event history model handles constraints on who can act or who can be acted upon in a straightforward way. The model can be estimated with multilevel logistic regression analysis, which is illustrated by an application to book reviews, so network evolution can be analyzed with a fairly standard statistical tool.

Given that the network communication resources are becoming limited with the ever-increasing network traffic, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism (AETM) is adopted for the systems to mitigate the pressure of network bandwidth. The considered discrete-time networked systems are envisioned to suffer from both Deception attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, thereby a novel hybrid cyber attacks model is firstly constructed to integrate the two kinds of attacks. Then, a filtering error system model is established for the discrete-time networked systems under AETM and hybrid cyber attacks. Based on the constructed model, the sufficient conditions that guaranteeing the asymptotic stability and H-infinity performance of the concerned filtering error system are analyzed based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory. Furthermore, the corresponding parameters of the designed filter are derived by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The effectiveness of the designed filter is finally demonstrated by conducting a numerical example. (C) 2021 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Chronic smoking, but not acute nicotine administration, modulates neural correlates of working memory	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY												Beyond the amelioration of deprivation-induced impairments, and in contrast to effects on attentional processes, the cognitive-enhancing properties of nicotine on working memory (WM) operations remain unclear. In an effort to elucidate potential enhancing effects, we explored the impact of transdermal nicotine on neural functioning in minimally deprived smokers and, in addition, assessed differences between smokers and non-smokers using a mixed block/event-related fMRI design that attempted to isolate specific central executive operations (attentional switch events) within general WM function (task blocks). In task blocks, participants performed a continuous counting paradigm that required the simultaneous maintenance of, and frequent switching of attentional focus between, two running tallies in WM on some trials. Cigarette smokers (n = 30) were scanned twice, once each with a nicotine and placebo patch, while non-smokers (n = 27) were scanned twice with no patch. Across both groups, task blocks were associated with bilateral activation, notably in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior insula, and parietal regions, whereas individual attentional switch trials were associated with activation in a similar, but predominantly left-lateralized network. Within the smoker group, although nicotine increased heart rate, altered performance and mood, and reduced tobacco cravings, no acute drug (state-like) effect on brain activity was detected for either the task or switch effects. However, relative to non-smokers, smokers showed greater tonic activation in medial superior frontal cortex, right anterior insula, and bilateral anterior PFC throughout task blocks (trait-like effect). These data suggest smokers require recruitment of additional WM and supervisory control operations during task performance.

J	AlDuwaile, DA; Islam, MS				AlDuwaile, Dalal A.; Islam, Md Saiful			Using Convolutional Neural Network and a Single Heartbeat for ECG Biometric Recognition	ENTROPY												The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has become a popular biometric modality due to characteristics that make it suitable for developing reliable authentication systems. However, the long segment of signal required for recognition is still one of the limitations of existing ECG biometric recognition methods and affects its acceptability as a biometric modality. This paper investigates how a short segment of an ECG signal can be effectively used for biometric recognition, using deep-learning techniques. A small convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to achieve better generalization capability by entropy enhancement of a short segment of a heartbeat signal. Additionally, it investigates how various blind and feature-dependent segments with different lengths affect the performance of the recognition system. Experiments were carried out on two databases for performance evaluation that included single and multisession records. In addition, a comparison was made between the performance of the proposed classifier and four well-known CNN models: GoogLeNet, ResNet, MobileNet and EfficientNet. Using a time-frequency domain representation of a short segment of an ECG signal around the R-peak, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99.90% for PTB, 98.20% for the ECG-ID mixed-session, and 94.18% for ECG-ID multisession datasets. Using the preprinted ResNet, we obtained 97.28% accuracy for 0.5-second segments around the R-peaks for ECG-ID multisession datasets, outperforming existing methods. It was found that the time-frequency domain representation of a short segment of an ECG signal can be feasible for biometric recognition by achieving better accuracy and acceptability of this modality.

J	Black, H; Fitzgerald, A				Black, Helen; Fitzgerald, Anneke			Organisational Climate for Change And Innovativeness: A Social Capital Perspective	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT												Purpose: Acute health services around the world are increasingly required to respond to accreditation institutes, the changing needs and expectations of patients and societal values that demand continuous improvement in quality and efficiencies. Many change initiatives and innovative attempts have failed or resulted in lower performance than expected. The purpose of this paper is to increase understanding of the organisational contextual factors such as social capital and organisational climate that interact with the change implementation processes and provide a new perspective for change management in the unique environment of acute health care. Methodology: This mixed methods study was executed in three different sized operating theatre suites. A survey and in-depth interviews were used to reveal a current organisational climate for innovativeness through team member perspectives. The strength of each organisational climate was assessed with reference to the level of disparity in the participant responses. In-depth interviews and observations provided understanding of how social capital is developed and maintained, then examined in context with the climate for innovativeness to understand how contextual factors, social capital and climate interact. Findings: It has been demonstrated that social capital in the operating theatre suite has bearing on the organisational climate for change and innovativeness. Size and structure of an organisation influence how social networks develop; policies and management practices influence how different networks interact; and, the combination of contextual factors and social capital influences the organisational climate for innovativeness. Originality/value: Managing social capital can offer a people-focused perspective through which to design and implement change and enhance an organisational climate for innovativeness.

Increased understanding of the gelling behaviour of non-soy legumes can facilitate development of novel plant-based foods based on other legumes, such as faba bean. A mixture design was used in this study to evaluate the effect of different proportions of protein, starch and fibre fractions extracted from faba beans on gelation properties, texture and microstructure of the resulting gels. Large deformation properties, in terms of fracture stress and fracture strain, decreased as fibre and/or starch replaced protein. In contrast, Young's modulus and storage modulus increased with substitution of the protein. Light microscopy revealed that for all gels, protein remained the continuous phase within the region studied (65-100% protein fraction, 0-35% starch fraction, 0-10% fibre fraction in total flour added). Swollen and deformed starch granules were distributed throughout the mixed gels with added starch. Leaked amylose aggregated on starch and fibre surfaces and in small cavities (<1 mu m) throughout the protein network. No clear difference between samples in protein network structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The reduction in large deformation properties was tentatively attributed to inhomogeneities created by the added starch and fibre. The increase in small deformation properties was hypothesised to be affected by water adsorption and moisture stability through the starch and fibre, increasing the effective protein concentration in the surrounding matrix and enhancing the protein network, or potentially by starch granules and fibre particles acting as active fillers reinforcing the gel structure.

J	Stamov, T				Stamov, Trayan			Impulsive Control Discrete Fractional Neural Networks in Product Form Design: Practical Mittag-Leffler Stability Criteria	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												The planning, regulation and effectiveness of the product design process depend on various characteristics. Recently, bio-inspired collective intelligence approaches have been applied in this process in order to create more appealing product forms and optimize the design process. In fact, the use of neural network models in product form design analysis is a complex process, in which the type of network has to be determined, as well as the structure of the network layers and the neurons in them; the connection coefficients, inputs and outputs have to be explored; and the data have to be collected. In this paper, an impulsive discrete fractional neural network modeling approach is introduced for product design analysis. The proposed model extends and complements several existing integer-order neural network models to the generalized impulsive discrete fractional-order setting, which is a more flexible mechanism to study product form design. Since control and stability methods are fundamental in the construction and practical significance of a neural network model, appropriate impulsive controllers are designed, and practical Mittag-Leffler stability criteria are proposed. The Lyapunov function strategy is applied in providing the stability criteria and their efficiency is demonstrated via examples and a discussion. The established examples also illustrate the role of impulsive controllers in stabilizing the behavior of the neuronal states. The proposed modeling approach and the stability results are applicable to numerous industrial design tasks in which multi-agent systems are implemented.																				2076-3417				MAY	2024	14	9							3705	10.3390/app14093705	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app14093705													WOS:001219915700001
J	Liang, M; Delahaye, D; Marechal, P				Liang, Man; Delahaye, Daniel; Marechal, Pierre			Conflict-free arrival and departure trajectory planning for parallel runway with advanced point-merge system	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												In this paper, an efficient trajectory planning system is proposed to solve the integration of arrivals and departures on parallel runways with a novel route network system. Our first effort is made in designing an advanced Point Merge (PM) route network named Multi-Level Point Merge (ML-PM) to meet the requirements of parallel runway operations. Then, more efforts are paid on finding a complete and efficient framework capable of dynamically modelling the integration of arrival and departure trajectories on parallel runways, modelling the conflict detection and resolution in presence of curved trajectory and radius-to-fix merging process. After that, a suitable mathematical optimization formulation is built up. Receding Horizon Control (RHC) and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms are proposed to search the near-optimal solution for the large scale trajectories in routine dense operations. Taking Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) as a study case, the experimental results show that our system shows good performances on the management of arrivals and departures. It can automatically solve all the potential conflicts in presence of dense traffic flows. With its unique ML-PM route network, it can realize a shorter flying time and a near-Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) descent for arrival aircraft, an economical climbing for departure aircraft, an easier runway allocation together with trajectory control solutions.

Course of Subtypes of Late-Life Depression Identified by Bipartite Network Analysis During Psychosocial Interventions	JAMA PSYCHIATRY												IMPORTANCE Approximately half of older adults with depression remain symptomatic at treatment end. Identifying discrete clinical profiles associated with treatment outcomes may guide development of personalized psychosocial interventions. OBJECTIVE To identify clinical subtypes of late-life depression and examine their depression trajectory during psychosocial interventions in older adults with depression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prognostic study included older adults aged 60 years or older who had major depression and participated in 1 of 4 randomized clinical trials of psychosocial interventions for late-life depression. Participants were recruited from the community and outpatient services of Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of California, San Francisco, between March 2002 and April 2013. Data were analyzed from February 2019 to February 2023. INTERVENTIONS Participants received 8 to 14 sessions of (1) personalized intervention for patients with major depression and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (2) problem-solving therapy, (3) supportive therapy, or (4) active comparison conditions (treatment as usual or case management). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomewas the trajectory of depression severity, assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). A data-driven, unsupervised, hierarchical clustering of HAM-D items at baseline was conducted to detect clusters of depressive symptoms. A bipartite network analysis was used to identify clinical subtypes at baseline, accounting for both between- and within-patient variability across domains of psychopathology, social support, cognitive impairment, and disability. The trajectories of depression severity in the identified subtypes were compared using mixed-effects models, and time to remission (HAM-D score <= 10) was compared using survival analysis. RESULTS The bipartite network analysis, which included 535 older adults with major depression (mean [SD] age, 72.7 [8.7] years; 70.7% female), identified 3 clinical subtypes: (1) individuals with severe depression and a large social network; (2) older, educated individuals experiencing strong social support and social interactions; and (3) individuals with disability. There was a significant difference in depression trajectories (F-2,F-2976.9 = 9.4; P < .001) and remission rate (log-rank chi(2)(2) = 18.2; P <.001) across clinical subtypes. Subtype 2 had the steepest depression trajectory and highest likelihood of remission regardless of the intervention, while subtype 1 had the poorest depression trajectory. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this prognostic study, bipartite network clustering identified 3 subtypes of late-life depression. Knowledge of patients' clinical characteristics may inform treatment selection. Identification of discrete subtypes of late-life depression may stimulate the development of novel, streamlined interventions targeting the clinical vulnerabilities of each subtype.

However, patients do not always take the simplest route from admission to discharge, but can experience convoluted movement patterns, particularly when bed availability is low. Few studies have explored the impact of these rarer, atypical trajectories. Using a mixed-method explanatory sequential study design, we firstly used three continuous years of electronic health record data prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, from 55,152 patients admitted to a London hospital network to define the ward specialities by patient type using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. We explored the impact of 'regular transfers' between pairs of wards with shared specialities, 'atypical transfers' between pairs of wards with no shared specialities and 'site transfers' between pairs of wards in different hospital site locations, on length of stay, 30-day readmission and mortality. Secondly, to understand the possible reasons behind atypical transfers we conducted three focus groups and three in-depth interviews with site nurse practitioners and bed managers within the same hospital network. We found that at least one atypical transfer was experienced by 12.9% of patients. Each atypical transfer is associated with a larger increase in length of stay, 2.84 days (95% CI 2.56-3.12), compared to regular transfers, 1.92 days (95% CI 1.82-2.03). No association was found between odds of mortality, or 30-day readmission and atypical transfers after adjusting for confounders. Atypical transfers appear to be driven by complex patient conditions, a lack of hospital capacity, the need to reach specific services and facilities, and more exceptionally, rare events such as major incidents. Our work provides an important first step in identifying unusual patient movement and its impacts on key patient outcomes using a system-wide, data-driven approach. The broader impact of moving patients between hospital wards, and possible downstream effects should be considered in hospital policy and service planning.

This paper investigates a discrete neural network control with an observer for the oxygen excess ratio (OER) control. The control goal is to avoid oxygen starvation and maintain the optimal net power. Specifically, by utilizing coordinate transformation and Euler approximation, the discrete strict-feedback form is obtained, and the backstepping technique can be applied. To estimate the unavailable variable with the measurable system output, a discrete neural network observer is proposed. Besides, the discrete neural network controller is designed to tackle the system uncertainty and achieve an ideal OER tracking. Finally, the system tracking error is proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded by Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed controller.

For different jumping modes, different event-triggered communication schemes are constructed to choose which output signals should be transmitted. Through the analysis of network-induced delay's intervals, the discrete-time system, the event-triggered scheme and network-induced delay are unified into a discrete-time Markov jump filter error system with time-delay. Based on time-delay system analysis method, criteria are derived to guarantee the discrete-time Markov jump error system stochastically stable with an H-infinity norm bound. The correspondent filter and the event-based parameters are also given. A numerical example is given to show that the proposed filter design techniques are effective and event-triggered communication scheme can save limited network resources greatly.

J	Hartleb, J; Schmidt, M				Hartleb, Johann; Schmidt, Marie			Railway timetabling with integrated passenger distribution	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												Timetabling for railway services often aims at optimizing travel times for passengers. At the same time, restricting assumptions on passenger behavior and passenger modeling are made. While research has shown that discrete choice models are suitable to estimate the distribution of passengers on routes, this has not been considered in timetabling yet. We investigate how to integrate a passenger distribution into an optimization framework for timetabling and present two mixed integer linear programs for this problem. Both approaches design timetables and simultaneously find a corresponding passenger distribution on available routes. One model uses a linear distribution model to estimate passenger route choices. The other model uses an integrated simulation framework to approximate a passenger distribution according to the logit model, a commonly used route choice model. We compare both new approaches with three state-of-the-art timetabling methods and a heuristic approach on a set of artificial instances and a partial network of Netherlands Railways (NS). Our experiments provide insights into the impact of considering multiple routes instead of a single route, and of integrated route choice versus predetermined route assignment with respect to the solution quality.

Recently, however, on-demand ridesourcing has become a viable mode alternative, most notably through the growth of major transportation network companies, such as Uber and Lyft. The availability of this new transportation option is expected to have important implications for adaptive disaster response. The goal of this work is to investigate the influence of internal and external contextual factors on preferred ridesourcing applications during small-scale urban evacuations. A case study was conducted in the three most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. Data were collected using an internet-based stated preference survey, and a discrete choice model was estimated to analyze the 185 responses. Determinants of on-demand ridesourcing for evacuation include internal factors, such as interactions between race, gender, and income, and external contextual factors, such as the evacuation notification source, consequence severity, immediacy, evacuation distance, unfamiliarity of surroundings, and traveling with others. Findings are illustrated through three ridesourcing applications based on specific evacuation needs. Policy recommendations are provided for the design of equitable evacuation services, soft policy communication strategies, and public-private partnerships.

J	Peppel, M; Spinler, S				Peppel, Marcel; Spinler, Stefan			The impact of optimal parcel locker locations on costs and the environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT												Purpose Last-mile delivery is associated with a negative environmental impact and high costs. The purpose of this paper is to develop an approach to designing stationary parcel locker (SPL) networks while minimizing both CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions and costs during delivery and pick-up. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a multinomial logit model to evaluate recipients' willingness to use SPLs based on their availability at home and travel distance. To determine optimal SPL locations, this study formulates a mixed-integer linear programming model. Findings The empirical study of different regional clusters reveals that optimal SPL locations can generate cost savings of up to 11.0%. SPLs have a positive impact on total CO(2)e emission savings in urban areas (i.e. up to 2.5%), but give rise to additional emissions (i.e. 4.6%) in less populated areas due to longer travel distances during the pick-up process. Originality/value This paper optimizes SPL locations and the ecological effect of SPLs by minimizing emissions and costs simultaneously. Furthermore, it extends existing discrete choice models by also including recipients' availability at home, increasing the accuracy of recipients' preferences. So far, the effect of SPLs has been studied for metropolitan areas only. A global logistics service provider shared a real dataset which allows us to study seven different regional clusters ranging from rural areas to large cities. Thus, this study contributes to the field of sustainable urban logistics.

The networks are modeled as discrete-time nth-order systems. On the basis of the system state space description, a novel sliding-mode controller with a linear quadratic optimal switching plane is designed. Two control laws are proposed, each derived by minimizing different cost functionals. The first law is obtained when the whole state vector is considered in the optimization procedure, whereas in the latter case, the derivation concentrates on the system output variable with an additional weighting coefficient introduced into the cost functional. Closed-loop system stability is demonstrated, and the conditions for no data loss and full bottleneck link bandwidth utilization in the network are presented and strictly proved. According to the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the first attempt to design a discrete-time sliding-mode flow control algorithm for connection-oriented communication networks.

J	Zhao, ZH; Lee, CKM; Ren, JZ				Zhao, Zhonghao; Lee, Carman K. M.; Ren, Jingzheng			A two-level charging scheduling method for public electric vehicle charging stations considering heterogeneous demand and nonlinear charging profile	APPLIED ENERGY												This paper investigates the electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling problem for public EV charging stations (EVCSs) that can accommodate heterogeneous charging demands, aiming to flatten the aggregate load on the power grid and reduce the peak demand. In contrast to existing works that mainly focus on a single scheduling strategy, a two-level hierarchical charging scheduling method is proposed, which includes an online booking system (OBS) and a pricing-based charging control system (PCCS). Specifically, the implementation of OBS can reduce the service capacity of bookable chargers, whereas PCCS can facilitate the redistribution of charging demand from peak to off-peak time periods. Moreover, the nonlinear charging profile of the battery is incorporated into the model to better reflect the real charging process. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach with a discrete Markov decision process (MDP) formulation is designed to find the optimal scheduling solution, where deep Q-network (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) are combined to handle the hybrid action space with both discrete and continuous actions. A comprehensive set of experiments is carried out to examine the effectiveness of the developed two-level scheduling scheme. The results indicate that the proposed method improves the scheduling effectiveness compared to single-strategy methods by 6.7% to 49.44%.																			0306-2619	1872-9118				FEB 1	2024	355								122278	10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.122278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.122278		NOV 2023											WOS:001122441700001

J	Hsu, YL; Wang, SG; Yu, CC				Hsu, YL; Wang, SG; Yu, CC			A sequential approximation method using neural networks for engineering design optimization problems	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												There are three characteristics in engineering design optimization problems: (1) the design variables are often discrete physical quantities; (2) the constraint functions often cannot be expressed analytically in terms of design variables; (3) in many engineering design applications, critical constraints are often 'pass-fail', '0-1' type binary constraints. This paper presents a sequential approximation method specifically for engineering optimization problems with the three characteristics. In this method a back-propagation neural network is trained to simulate a rough map of the feasible domain formed by the constraints using a few representative training data. A training data point consists of a discrete design point and whether this design point is feasible or infeasible. Function values of the constraints are not required. A search algorithm then searches for the optimal point in the feasible domain simulated by the neural network. This new design point is checked against the true constraints to see whether it is feasible, and is then added to the training set. The neural network is trained again with this added information, in the hope that the network will better simulate the boundary of the feasible domain of the true optimization problem. Then a further search is made for the optimal point in this new approximated feasible domain. This process continues in an iterative manner until the approximate model locates the same optimal point in consecutive iterations. A restart strategy is also employed so that the method may have a better chance to reach a global optimum. Design examples with large discrete design spaces and implicit constraints are solved to demonstrate the practicality of this method.																			0305-215X	1029-0273				OCT	2003	35	5					489	511		10.1080/03052150310001620713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03052150310001620713													WOS:000186294000003

The triple-porosity model is the major approach up to now. However, the triple-continuum assumption in this model is unacceptable for many cases. In the present work, an efficient numerical model has been developed for immiscible two-phase flow in fractured karst reservoirs based on the idea of equivalent continuum representation. First, based on the discrete fracture-vug model and homogenization theory, the effective absolute permeability tensors for each grid blocks are calculated. And then an analytical procedure to obtain a pseudo relative permeability curves for a grid block containing fractures and cavities has been successfully implemented. Next, a full-tensor simulator has been designed based on a hybrid numerical method (combining mixed finite element method and finite volume method). A simple fracture system has been used to demonstrate the validity of our method. At last, we have used the fracture and cavity statistics data from TAHE outcrops in west China, effective permeability values and other parameters from our code, and an equivalent continuum simulator to calculate the water flooding profiles for more realistic systems.

Unfortunately, given a domain-specific dataset, searching effective feature interaction operations and combinations from a huge candidate space requires significant expert experience and computational costs. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has achieved great success in discovering high-quality network architectures automatically. However, due to the diversity of feature interaction operations and combinations, the existing NAS-based work that treats the architecture search as a black-box optimization problem over a discrete search space suffers from low efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to explore a more efficient architecture search method. To achieve this goal, we propose NAS-CTR, a differentiable neural architecture search approach for CTR prediction. First, we design a novel and expressive architecture search space and a continuous relaxation scheme to make the search space differentiable. Second, we formulate the architecture search for CTR prediction as a joint optimization problem with discrete constraints on architectures and leverage proximal iteration to solve the constrained optimization problem. Additionally, a straightforward yet effective method is proposed to eliminate the aggregation of skip connections. Extensive experimental results reveal that NAS-CTR can outperform the SOTA human-crafted architectures and other NAS-based methods in both test accuracy and search efficiency.

A novel neural network model, named standard neural network model (SNNM), is used to provide a general framework for robust stabilising controller synthesis of RNNs. Most of the existing RNNs can be transformed into SNNM to be synthesised in a unified way. Applying the Lyapunov stability theory and the S-procedure technique, state feedback controllers are designed to guarantee the global asymptotical stability of closed-loop dynamic discrete-time systems. The controller gains are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities.

Today, most such systems are divided into event-triggered and continuous monitoring, but they all lack systematic handling of data. Many systems simply store data in files with specific naming conventions and ad hoc formats, making them difficult to retrieve, maintain, disseminate, and analyze. To address these problems, our backend supports data management and dissemination. Unlike previous systems that store data in files or conventional databases before analysis, our modular architecture not only saves data in efficiently searchable ways by indexing as a baseline dataset but also detected events in discrete time manner and other processed data. To facilitate analysis, we design a plug-in structure to allow processing modules to perform inline processing and shorten detection time. For data dissemination, our architecture can compose multiple visualizations including geographical maps to create powerful tools to yield new insight into massive datasets. The backend system enables Internet web service for visualization, data mangement, and remote sensor control for better integration. Our system is applicable to not only water pipelines but also bridges and civil structures in general. Our proposed backend system has been implemented and validated through field deployment. One such system has been running for over 1.5 years and has collected millions of records to date. A Google Map intergrated visualization service has been developed to demostrate lively collected records in real-time. This is expected to be more helpful for better understanding of civil structures' behavior in the long term.																			0277-786X		978-0-8194-9989-9				2014	9063									10.1117/12.2045264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2045264													WOS:000349294800035
J	Meng, Q; Yang, H				Meng, Q; Yang, H			Benefit distribution and equity in road network design	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												In the classical continuous network design problem, the optimal capacity enhancements are determined by minimizing the total system cost under a budget constraint, while taking into account the route choice behavior of network users. Generally the equilibrium origin-destination travel costs for some origin-destination (O-D) pairs may be increased after implementing these optimal capacity enhancements, leading to positive or negative results for network users. Therefore, the equity issue about the benefit gained from the network design problem is raised. In this paper, we examine the benefit distribution among the network users and the resulting equity associated with the continuous network design problem in terms of the change of equilibrium O-D travel costs. Bilevel programming models that incorporate the equity constraint are proposed for the continuous network design problem. A penalty function approach by embodying a simulated annealing method is used to test the models for a network example. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Determination of phase diagrams	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT					Conference on Heat Transfer in Components and Systems for Sustainable Energy Technologies	APR 05-07, 2005	Grenoble, FRANCE					Accurate knowledge of high pressure phase equilibrium is of utmost interest in designing chemical processes and separation units operating at high pressures. Moreover, these data are essential to develop optimized models in order to provide continuous representation of high pressure phase equilibrium. The best models are required to permit process simulators to be the most accurate as possible. There are many experimental ways to obtain information about the phase behaviour of fluid mixtures. They can be classified into two main categories: open and closed circuit methods. Closed circuit methods are composed of two main categories: the synthetic methods where compositions are known a priori and analytic methods where samplers are needed. The laboratory has published several data sets concerning refrigerant systems (binaries and ternaries). The more recent are: binary and ternary systems with 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (R227ea), difluoromethane (R32) (two hydrofluorocarbons) and propane (R290), - binaries of R227ea or R32 with CO2 (R744) and an old refrigerant SO2 (R764), - ternary system composed of dimethyl ether (DME), pentafluoroethane (R125) and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a), - binary systems involving DME with R134a and R32. In this paper we have focused our attention on two types of models: - the first one is a thermodynamic model implying equations of state and several mixing rules, - the second one is a neural network model. It is not a "thermodynamic" model, but it can be used to calculate thermodynamics properties like enthalpy, entropy from density values. It has been used to represent density data of the R134a + R125 + DME ternary system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The system is completely passive and suitable for millimeter-wave applications, including some in defense, where both discrete beam steering and continuous beam steering in two dimensions (elevation and azimuth) are required at a reasonably fast speed. The beam-steering capability is achieved using a pair of distinct low-profile and planar phase transformers (PPTs) placed in the near-field region of a fixed-beam radiating source. The antenna system demonstrates a steering and impedance-matching bandwidth of 28.6%, from 30 to 40 GHz. A prototype of the new antenna system, including a pair of thin PPTs and a completely automated mechanical system to rotate each of the PPTs around the antenna axis, has been fabricated and tested. The pair of rotating PPTs, equivalent to a pair of 3-D dielectric PTs (DPTs), introduces a precalculated phase gradient to the input near field from the fixed-beam antenna and creates an output near field that will radiate toward a selected direction, which can be varied within a large conical region with a maximum apex angle of 108 degrees. The system exhibits the predicted and measured peak gains of 21.5 and 21.7 dBi, respectively, and the measured gain variation over 2-D beam steering is less than 2.2 dB. This beam-steering method obviates the need for expensive phase shifters and distribution networks, which are also lossy at mm-wave frequencies. The measured results validate the predicted wideband matching and steering performance of the system with a close agreement.

J	Weiwei, T; Shaohui, W; Sabzevari, K				Weiwei, Tong; Shaohui, Wang; Sabzevari, Kiomars			What are the key stability challenges in high-bandwidth, non-minimum phase systems with time-varying, and non-smooth delays?	HELIYON												The analysis and control of stability in high-bandwidth systems characterized by non-minimum phase delays represent a formidable challenge within the realm of control theory and engineering. This research aims to address the pivotal question of whether it is feasible to enhance the stability of such intricate systems. These systems inherently possess uncertain and swiftly changing delay characteristics, rendering them exceptionally demanding to control effectively. In the course of this investigation, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of the theoretical underpinnings of the stability of high-bandwidth, non-minimum phase delay systems. This encompassing inquiry encompasses a meticulous consideration of both derivative-delay and piecewise continuous delay components. To underpin our analysis, we judiciously incorporate feedback mechanisms, drawing upon mathematical tools such as the Jensen inequality and Lyapunov-based methodologies to rigorously establish stability conditions. Furthermore, our exploration extends to encompass the concept of input-output stability and complements it with the notion of asymptotic stability, thereby ensuring that the systems in question exhibit uniform stability across diverse temporal domains. The outcomes of our investigation furnish compelling evidence that by harnessing the power of discrete-time Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, it becomes conceivable to circumscribe the maximum delay within predefined thresholds. This achievement holds the promise of enhancing stability in non-minimum phase delay systems characterized by high bandwidth. These findings have far-reaching implications, profoundly influencing the design and control paradigms across a spectrum of engineering applications. Notably, this impact extends to areas such as communication networks, real-time control systems, and robotics, where the mitigation of instability due to non-minimum phase delays has been an enduring challenge.																				2405-8440				MAR 30	2024	10	6							e26949	10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26949		MAR 2024						38509937					WOS:001210739300001
J	Welch, H; McHenry, J				Welch, Heather; McHenry, Jennifer			Planning for dynamic process: An assemblage-level surrogate strategy for species seasonal movement pathways	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Seasonally mobile species are globally prevalent and often provide vital ecosystem functions and services along their seasonal movement pathways. However, owing to the challenges of planning for features that are spatially and temporally variable, mobile species are rarely accounted for in conservation planning. To protect this dynamic process, planners need a temporally explicit surrogate for species seasonal movement pathways. Because reserve networks typically aim to represent the full spectrum of biodiversity, these surrogates also need to capture the assemblage-level organization of species in order to preserve the full range of seasonal movement pathways that occur within a given planning region. 0002">To this end, this study introduces a new assemblage-level surrogate strategy for species seasonal movements that preserves variation in biodiversity across the 12months. Two monthly, assemblage-level attributes were integrated: discrete species assemblages and continuous assemblage suitability, thereby allowing planners to select complementary combinations of sites that achieve comprehensive assemblage coverage in each month. 0003">As a marine case-study, this strategy was applied to the US Mid-Atlantic, and a gap analysis was used to evaluate the ability of the Mid-Atlantic's current spatial management scheme to accommodate species' seasonal movements. 0004">The results indicate that current protected areas in the Mid-Atlantic will be unable to meet even modest quantitative objectives for protecting seasonal movements, and priority conservation areas are identified for designing a reserve network that offers year-round protection. 0005">Planning for processes remains a significant gap in conservation planning, and this study seeks to address this gap by proposing a surrogate strategy that will aid the incorporation of a widespread dynamic process into reserve design. This strategy uses public, predominantly global datasets that have terrestrial and marine counterparts, making it applicable to planning for species seasonal movements both on land and at sea.

Health Monitoring System Based on Intra-Body Communication	4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONIC DEVICES, SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS 2015 (ICEDSA)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				4th International Conference on Electronic Devices, Systems and Applications (ICEDSA)	SEP 14-15, 2015	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Univ Teknologi MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Amer Univ Ras Al Khaimah				This paper presents a model of a Body Area Network (BAN) health monitoring system based on Intra-Body Communication. Intra-body Communication (IBC) is a communication technique that uses the human body as a medium for electrical signal communication. One of the visions in the health care industry is to provide autonomous and continuous self and the remote health monitoring system. This can be achieved via BAN, LAN and WAN integration. The BAN technology itself consists of short range data communication modules, sensors, controller and actuators. The information can be transmitted to the LAN and WAN via the RF technology such as Bluetooth, ZigBee and ANT. Although the implementations of RF communication have been successful, there are still limitations in term of power consumption, battery lifetime, interferences and signal attenuations. One of the solutions for Medical Body Area Network (MBANs) to overcome these issues is by using an IBC technique because it can operate at lower frequencies and power consumption compared to the existing techniques. The first objective is to design the IBC's transmitter and receiver modules using the off the shelf components. The specifications of the modules such as frequency, data rate, modulation and demodulation coding system were defined. The individual module were designed and tested separately. The modules was integrated as an IBC system and tested for functionality then was implemented on PCB. Next objective is to model and implement the digital parts of the transmitter and receiver modules on the Altera's FPGA board. The digital blocks were interfaced with the FPGA's on board modules and the discrete components. The signals that have been received from the transmitter were converted into a proper waveform and it can be viewed via external devices such as oscilloscope and Labview. The signals such as heartbeats or pulses can also be displayed on LCD. In conclusion, the IBC project presents medical health monitoring model that operates at the range of 21 MHz frequency and reduce the power consumption for a longer battery lifetime.

The selected ambient conditions include different nozzle diameters, injection profiles, backpressure and ambient temperature. Transient Eulerian-Lagrangian multiphase solver in open source software, i.e., OpenFOAM, has been used for modeling fuel discrete phase interacting with compressible gaseous continuous phase. In addition, hybrid breakup model of KH-RT and k-epsilon have been applied as the standard model in Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes for liquid fuel core breakup and turbulence modeling, respectively. Numerical results of macroscopic spray characteristics have been validated against the experiment. On the other hand, supervised feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) with back-propagation learning algorithm have been designed to predict the average impinging spray penetration and cone angle under five different injection and ambient conditions. Likewise, 51 different CFD patterns have been used as the input evidence in the selected ANNs. To optimize the learning procedure, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm has been employed. Based on the iterative algorithm, our optimal ANNs have been selected from 260 different architectures. The selected ANNs are able to predict the impinging penetration length with mean square error (MSE) lower than 0.00097 and correlation coefficient higher than 0.98921. Moreover, the selected ANNs for predicting the spray cone angle have maximum MSE of 0.0004 and minimum correlation coefficient of 0.99439. According to weights and bias of the designed ANNs, two set of equations are proposed for predicting the impinging penetration length and cone angle. Moreover, Based on CFD results, longer impinging penetration length and larger cone angle are achieved using higher injection pressure and ambient temperature and lower backpressure.

J	Wang, L; Kong, LK; Ng, SX; Hanzo, L				Wang, Li; Kong, Lingkun; Ng, Soon Xin; Hanzo, Lajos			Code-Rate-Optimized Differentially Modulated Near-Capacity Cooperation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS												It is widely recognized that half-duplex-relay-aided differential decode-and-forward (DDF) cooperative transmission schemes are capable of achieving a cooperative diversity gain, while circumventing the potentially excessive-complexity and yet inaccurate channel estimation, especially in mobile environments. However, when a cooperative wireless communication system is designed to approach the maximum achievable spectral efficiency by taking the cooperation-induced multiplexing loss into account, it is not obvious whether or not the relay-aided system becomes superior to its direct-transmission based counterpart, especially, when advanced channel coding techniques are employed. Furthermore, the optimization of the transmit-interval durations required by the source and relay is an open issue, which has not been well understood in the context of half-duplex relaying schemes. Hence, we first find the optimum transmission duration, which is proportional to the adaptive channel-code rate of the source and relay in the context of Code-Rate-Optimized (CRO) TDMA-based DDF-aided half-duplex systems for the sake of maximizing the achievable network throughput. Then, we investigate the benefits of introducing cooperative mechanisms into wireless networks, which may be approached in the context of the proposed CRO cooperative system both from a pure capacity perspective and from the practical perspective of approaching the Discrete-input Continuous-output Memoryless Channel (DCMC) capacity with the aid of the proposed Irregular Distributed Differential (IrDD) coding aided scheme. In order to achieve a near-capacity performance at a low-complexity, an adaptive-window-duration based Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere Detection (MSDSD) scheme is employed in the iterative detection aided receiver. Specifically, upon using the proposed near-capacity system design, the IrDD coding scheme devised becomes capable of performing within about 1.8 dB from the corresponding single-relay-aided DDF cooperative system's DCMC capacity.

Optimal design of water distribution networks by a discrete state transition algorithm	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												In this study it is demonstrated that, with respect to model formulation, the number of linear and nonlinear equations involved in water distribution networks can be reduced to the number of closed simple loops. Regarding the optimization technique, a discrete state transition algorithm (STA) is introduced to solve several cases of water distribution networks. Firstly, the focus is on a parametric study of the restoration probability and risk probability' in the dynamic STA. To deal effectively with head pressure constraints, the influence is then investigated of the penalty coefficient and search enforcement on the performance of the algorithm. Based on the experience gained from training the Two-Loop network problem, a discrete STA has successfully achieved the best known solutions for the Hanoi, triple Hanoi and New York network problems.

Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were both used to model the methane content (MC, %) in the produced biogas and daily methane yield (DMY, mL CH4/g VS added) from the Co-AD process. The RSM models (R2 = 0.9554, RMSE = 0.813; R2 = 0.9618, RMSE = 4.940) were more accurate than the ANN models (R2 = 0.9163, RMSE = 1.114; R2 = 0.9037, RMSE = 7.847) in predicting MC and DMY, respectively. The optimal conditions for maximum DMY obtained by RSM were a C/N ratio of 22.73 (a mixing ratio of 0.46 g PL to 1.00 g WS on dry matter basis), total solids of 2.27%, and hydraulic retention time of 11.45 days, under which the validation trials showed MC of (58.37 & PLUSMN; 0.25)% and DMY of (184.36 & PLUSMN; 0.51) mL CH4/g VS added with the prediction errors by RSM (1.07% and 1.87%) being relatively lower than that by ANN (4.21% and 4.35%). The models and optimized parameters results could provide support for the operation and prediction of the continuous Co-AD of PL with WS for real bioenergy production applications.

Given the limited resources for communication and computation of robots, a distributed event-triggered method is firstly designed to reduce dependence on resources in multi-robot systems, where the controller's action is determined by whether the norm of the event-trigger function exceeds zero through continuous sampling. And then, to further minimize communications costs, a self-triggered strategy is proposed, which only uses discrete states sampled and sent by neighboring robots at their event instants. Furthermore, for the two proposed control laws, a Lyapunov functional is constructed, which allows sufficient stability conditions to be obtained on the circular formation for multi-robot systems. And at the same time, the controllers are proved to exclude Zeno behavior. At last, numerical simulation of controlling uniform and non-uniform circular formations by two control methods are conducted. Simulation results show that the designed controller can control all mobile robots to form either a uniform circular formation or a non-uniform circular formation while maintaining any desired relative distances between robots and guaranteeing that there is no collision during the whole evolution. One of the essential features of the proposed control methods is that they reduce the update rates of controllers and the communication frequency between robots. And also, the spatial order of robots is also preserved throughout the evaluation of the system without collision.

To study networked control for discrete event systems, network controllability and network observability are introduced in our previous work on networked supervisory control theory. In this paper, we investigate robust supervisory control for networked discrete event systems. We assume that the system to be controlled is not known precisely. We only know that it is one among several possibilities. The goal is to design a robust supervisor that works for all possibilities. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a robust supervisor. The condition must take into account the communication delays and losses in both observation channel and control channel. We show that the existence condition is characterized by network controllability and network observability that are keys to control networked discrete event systems.					王, 飞/IXN-4006-2023; Shu, Shaolong/K-9036-2012														2474-0195		978-1-4799-3409-6				2013							981	988																WOS:000350802400136

Methods: This study is a discrete choice experiment. Attributes and levels were identified through literature reviews, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and expert consultations. Experimental design principles were applied to generate choice sets containing different attribute levels and develop a survey instrument. Convenience sampling was conducted nationwide, and 1,045 participants were investigated. A mixed logit model was used to evaluate the public's preferences. Results: All attributes in our study were found to have a significant influence on the public's preferences for psychological interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The public's preferences for providers and duration were influenced by the public's levels of education and classifications. Furthermore, the most ideal scenario was found to be a one-on-one psychological intervention provided by family and friends through social network platforms, for which the frequency is twice per week, and the duration of each intervention is 0.5-1 h. Conclusions: The public's preferences for psychological interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic are affected by the method, form, frequency, provider, and duration of interventions.

However, most existing theoretical studies were based on continuous mechanics theory, mainly focusing on the impact of the asphalt layer on the macroscale response of the track bed or subgrade, and rarely on the particle-scale mechanical behavior of ballast due to the limitations of the method. Hence, aiming at the improved performance of asphalt track bed and its mesoscale mechanisms, the discrete element method (DEM) model of asphalt track bed is established in this study and then validated with the measurements obtained from on-site tests. Subsequently, the validated model is used to investigate the effect of asphalt layer on the dynamic response and cyclic settlement of ballasted track bed under high-speed train moving loading. Results reveal that the asphalt layer has an ability to reduce vibration of the track bed, which contributes to less active ballast and more stable interparticle structure, thereby decreasing the accumulative settlement of the ballast layer. Besides, the asphalt layer can improve the uniformity of the force chain network inside the ballast layer. The well distributed and less intense force chain network in the ballast results in a slower degradation rate. A series of parameter analyses is performed in the end, concluding that the required thickness of the ballast layer in the asphalt track bed could be reduced by approximately one-third without changing the bearing capacity of the subgrade, and the asphalt track bed structure is a more economical and effective track form for high-speed or heavy-haul railway lines. This study discusses the improvement of ballasted railway track by insertion of asphalt layer and its mesoscale working mechanisms, and the results provide guidance for the design of asphalt track bed in high-speed railways or heavy-haul railways.

The dynamics are decomposed into the altitude subsystem and the velocity subsystem. The altitude subsystem is transformed into the strict-feedback form from which the discrete-time model is derived by the first-order Taylor expansion. The virtual control is designed with nominal feedback and neural network (NN) approximation via back-stepping. Meanwhile, one adaptive NN controller is designed for the velocity subsystem. To avoid the circular construction problem in the practical control, the design of coefficients adopts the upper bound instead of the nominal value. Under the proposed controller, the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness stability is guaranteed. The square and step responses are presented in the simulation studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.

The exact solution of the discrete regulator equations is usually unavailable due to the nonlinearity of the system. This paper considers the problem of approximate solution of the discrete regulator equation using a feedforward neural network. It is shown that the discrete regulator equations can be approximately solved up to on arbitrarily small error by the feedforward neural networks.

The objective is to make an optimal investment decision in order to minimize the total travel cost in the network, while accounting for the route choice behaviors of network users. The discrete network design problem is considered as a two-stage Stackelberg game and is formulated as a combinatorial bi-level programming problem. The traditional lower-level model is user equilibrium based on path flow. The key to solve the lower-level model is to enumerate all the paths between each pair of origin and destination, which is difficult to a large-scale complex network. So in this paper, at first a traditional bi-level programming model for the discrete network design problem is introduced, and then a new bi-level programming model is proposed, in which the lower-level model is based on link flow,. Then a new algorithm for upper-level problem is proposed by using evolutionary game algorithm (EGA), and the lower-level by Frank-Wolfe Algorithm.

Two continuous process parameters, such as pH (4-9) and pulp density (1-10 g/L), and the bioleaching approaches, viz., one-step and two-step, were experimentally optimized for the extraction of targeted metals, i.e., Cu, Ni, and Zn from WPCBs by mixed cultures of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis. Datasets were then used for predictive modelling using AI tools. Results showed that the highest simultaneous bioleaching of Cu, Ni, and Zn, with an extraction efficacy of about 86%, 51%, and 100%, respectively, achieved at an optimal condition of pH 5.7 and pulp density of 3 g/L following the two-step bioleaching approach. Effective metal extraction in the two-step approach could be attributed to the abundant production of organic acids with a content of about 16.3 g/L, 8.4 g/L, and 0.5 g/L of citric acid, oxalic acid, and malic acid, respectively. Further, the predictive modelling revealed that the ANN model was found to predict the fungal bioleaching responses more accurately as compared to the SVM model with R2 values exceeding 0.96 for all targeted metals. This research demonstrates the applicability of the optimization and prediction models for efficient metal extraction from WPCBs using mixed Aspergillus spp. following the two-step approach.

J	Guo, YM				Guo, Yuming			Towards the efficient generation of variant design in product development networks: network nodes importance based product configuration evaluation approach	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING												The variant design node configuration is an effective method to solve a trade-off that exist in mass customization production between the requirements of product diversification and the product's cost and delivery time. However, configuration changes in a product development network may generate an avalanche effect of design change propagation, which can consume substantial design resources. In order to control design change propagations, an evaluation method based on network nodes importance for variant design node schemes is proposed for a product development network. Firstly, the evaluation indexes, including the betweenness, variant deign node set importance, and network clustering coefficient, are integrated to describe the network characteristics of the set of variant design nodes. Then, combining the time and resource constraints for the variant design, a discrete particle swarm algorithm is employed to optimize the configuration of the nodes. The configuration solution for the variant design nodes satisfies the need to control the variant design propagation. Compared with the established greedy algorithm, the discrete particle swarm optimization can achieve better optimization performance in terms of the algorithm's convergence and computation time. It is meaningful to understand the mechanism of product configuration change propagation in depth in order to choose the variant design nodes rationally and efficiently in complex product development networks. Lastly, an example of variant design for a type of cleaning robot product verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The SNNM is composed of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator. Based on the global asymptotic stability analysis of SNNMs, dynamic output feedback controllers are designed for the SNNMs to stabilize the closed-loop systems. The control design equations are shown to be a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMls) which can be easily solved by various convex optimization algorithms to determine the control signals. Most neural-network-based nonlinear systems can be transformed into the SNNMs for controller synthesis in a unified way. Two application examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed design approach, where the SNNMs are employed to synthesize the output feedback stabilizing controllers for discrete-time SISO nonlinear system modeled by the neural network, and chaotic neural network, respectively.																			1492-8760					DEC	2006	13E		6	S			2961	2966																WOS:000248842700081

The sol-gel-derived ambigel nanoarchitectures, with bicontinuous networks of covalently bonded nanoscale solid and through-connected mesopores, exhibit conductometric sensitivity to humidity as established by impedance spectroscopy. The spectra contain a Warburg feature from which the concentration and diffusion length of the protonic charge carriers are determined. Water adsorbs conformally onto the architecture's continuous solid network in equilibrium with atmospheric humidity to create a continuous water sheath that acts as a 3-D proton wire. As a result, monolithic manganese oxide ambigels exhibit an equilibrium conductometric response to humidity that is 14 times greater than that of previous reports for electrolytic manganese oxide. A packed bed of 1-10-mu m ambigel particulates in physical contact with one another, each with the same nanoscale morphology as the monolithic nanoarchitecture, also support long-range proton diffusion; however, the sensitivity to humidity is four times lower than the monolithic form due to restricted proton transport between adjacent particulates. Films composed of 0.3-12-mu m ambigel particulates supported on interdigitated array electrodes with 20-mu m electrode spacing express finite-diffusion behavior due to the short distance between the contact electrodes and have a conductometric sensitivity to humidity comparable to electrolytic MnO2 and 17 times lower than the monolithic ambigel. These results suggest that controlling the nature of the porous and solid phases in a nanoarchitecture provides a mechanism to limit interference from condensed water in conductometric gas-phase sensors. In addition, continuous monolithic architectures should improve electrochemical performance in devices where efficient long-range transport of protons or other ions is critical.

The networks are modelled as discrete time, nth-order systems. On the basis of the system state space description, novel sliding mode controllers with linear quadratic (LQ) optimal and sub-optimal switching planes are designed. The control law derivation focuses on the minimization of the LQ cost functional and solving the resultant matrix Riccati equation. Closed-loop system stability is demonstrated, and conditions for no data loss and full bottleneck link bandwidth utilization in the network are presented and strictly proved.

However, low gas production rate, especially in areas where hydraulic fracturing is notoriously inefficient, is the major obstacle that restricts the commercial development of CBM. Multistage horizontal well cavity completion has been observed to be successful in improving gas production rates in the Zhengzhuang block, Qinshui Basin, China. It has resulted in rates that are 1.5 times higher than the average production level achieved through horizontal well hydraulic fracturing. However, the stimulation mechanisms and major factors determining completion efficiency are still poorly understood. In this paper, we established a numerical model using the finite discrete element method (FDEM) to compute the stress evolution and fracture-network pat-terns. The accuracy of the model has been confirmed by analytical and numerical solutions. Subsequently, a series of parametric studies were performed to quantitatively analyze the mechanisms of multistage cavities influencing the stress evolution and fracture geometries in CBM reservoirs. Finally, we investigated a field case in an actual horizontal well located at the Qinshui Basin, where 17 cavity stages were completed. This case study further shed light upon the well completion strategies and optimization decisions. Implications and suggestions were also provided for field treatments to enhance the completion efficiency. The results demonstrate that FDEM can provide new insights into cavity completion mechanisms by explicitly accounting for fracture and fragmentation process at the field scale. The complex-fracture networks originated from multistage cavities consist of cavity-induced shear fractures, tensile fractures, mixed- mode fractures, and activated multiscale natural fractures, which is the primary reason for enhanced permeability and the essential difference from hydraulic fracturing. Compared with a single cavity, the interactions among multiple cavities can further promote the fracture-network connectivity and thus enlarge the stress- relief area and fracture area substantially. The selections of cavity geometrical parame-ters, including spacing, length, diameter, and number, have significant impacts on stress evolution (both magnitude and stress- relief area) and fracture patterns (such as fracture-network geometry, interconnectivity, propagation direction, and area). Stress evolution and fracture patterns reproduced from a field case in the Qinshui Basin can provide critical learnings for the industry in designing horizontal well cavity completion schemes. The key findings of this study are expected to deliver fundamental and practical guidelines for the horizontal well cavity completion in CBM or other unconventional oil and gas exploitation.					zhongwei, Huang/AAC-8450-2021; LI, Gensheng/HIR-3613-2022	LI, Gensheng/0000-0002-7342-8513													1086-055X	1930-0220				DEC	2023	28	6																						WOS:001147899900003

J	Berman, IE; Routtenberg, T				Berman, Itai E.; Routtenberg, Tirza			Resource Allocation and Dithering of Bayesian Parameter Estimation Using Mixed-Resolution Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING												Quantization of signals is an integral part of modern signal processing applications, such as sensing, communication, and inference. While signal quantization provides many physical advantages, it usually degrades the subsequent estimation performance that is based on quantized data. In an attempt to maintain physical constraints, while, simultaneously, to attain substantial performance gain, we consider systems with mixed-resolution, 1-bit quantized and continuous-valued, data. First, we describe the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimator and its associated mean-squared error (MSE) for the general mixed-resolution model. However, the MSE of the LMMSE requires matrix inversion, where the number of measurements defines the matrix dimensions and thus, may not be a tractable tool for optimization and system design. Therefore, we present the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) measurement model and derive a closed-form analytic expression for the MSE of the LMMSE estimator under this model. We discuss two common special cases of the LGO model: 1) scalar parameter estimation, and 2) channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with mixed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We then solve the resource allocation optimization problem under the LGO model, with the proposed tractable MSE as an objective function and under a power constraint by using a one-dimensional search. Further, we present the concept of dithering for mixed-resolution models and optimize the dithering noise as part of the resource allocation optimization problem. Simulations show that the proposed resource allocation and dithering policies provide significant performance improvement.																			1053-587X	1941-0476					2021	69						6148	6164		10.1109/TSP.2021.3119430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3119430													WOS:000719561100006

Based on the ground displacement power spectral density, an discrete-time exosystem is employed to estimate the random road disturbances. A two degree of freedom discrete-time system is introduced to describe the active suspension under in-vehicle networks. Then, the original vibration control is formulated as the optimal control for a linear discrete-time system affected by external disturbances. The feedforward and feedback optimal vibration rejection law (FFOVRL) is designed by solving the Riccate and Stein equations, in which the feedforward term incorporates the information of the random road disturbances and the feedback loop includes the status of suspension system. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches are validated by an active suspension structure.

The rationality and economy of pipeline-network construction are becoming increasingly important. Generally, the investment required for constructing pipeline networks is more than 30% of the total investment required for the development of an oil-gas field. Therefore, based on the characteristics of pipeline networks, the design of oil-gas pipeline networks needs to be optimized to reduce the investment. In this study, considering the discrete characteristic of facility location in the pipeline network, a comprehensive and optimal mathematical model of the star-tree oil-gas pipeline network was established considering various constraints. From the standpoint of characteristics of the complex model comprising numerous discrete variables, a hierarchical-optimization strategy was presented to decompose the optimization problem into four subproblems. An optimization program was compiled. Furthermore, the developed optimization program was applied to a case study to demonstrate the optimization process of the subproblem well clustering. Finally, the optimization program helped in optimizing the pipeline-network layout of a practical project under the known or unknown station location conditions. The manual and optimal designs were compared. Consequently, the optimization model presented in this paper was proven to be an effective method to solve the optimization problem for the star-tree oil-gas pipeline network in a discrete space.

Based on the approximation approach of neural network, system uncertainties are tackled approximately. To restrain the negative effects of bounded disturbances, a nonlinear DTDO is designed. Then, a backstepping technique-based ANC strategy is proposed by utilizing a constructed auxiliary system and a discrete-time tracking differentiator. The boundness of all signals is proven in the closed-loop system under the discrete-time Lyapunov analysis.

According to the large amount of data collected, the active fault tolerance/active passive capacity of linear discrete NCS under the discrete event-triggered communication mechanism (DETCS) is studied. The problem of cooperative controller design is discussed. Firstly, a linear discrete NCS model integrating DETCS, actuator fault, and network attack is established. Then, based on the idea of integral sliding mode control, an active fault-tolerant/attack active passive intrusion-tolerant cooperative controller is designed, and the actuator attack side network attack and sensor side network attack are extended to the state to obtain a new state vector. Then, an adaptive Kalman filter estimator (AKF) estimates the fault and attack information and then adjusts the initial fault-tolerant/intrusion-tolerant cooperative controller in real time according to the estimated information obtained by the adaptive Kalman filter estimator; finally, the MATLAB simulation example is used to verify the improvement of system performance by the designed control law and the saving of network resources by the introduction of DETCS.

The latter results in the need for simulation tools which support mutable system configurations. The problems encountered when modeling mutable system configurations using conventional discrete-event simulators are discussed. In order to show a possible solution to this problem we introduce configuration events and configuration objects into the theory of discrete-event simulations. We demonstrate how configuration objects can be implemented in a discrete-event simulator using a dynamic map-function, hereby extending a definition of higher order functions. We apply the configuration objects in a Multiple Layer Model for modeling an entire mobile cellular radio network in a discrete-event simulator as an application for the extended theory. In this model we use the configuration objects to change the network's configuration during runtime. We show that this solution-combined with an object-oriented software design and, possibly, a visual programming language-is a powerful tool for the simulation of the dynamic aspects of mobile cellular radio networks. The software technology presented will be applied by the German cellular network operator Mannesmann Mobilfunk to model dynamic features applicable to the radio resource management of mobile radio networks and to access their performance by simulation.																			0929-5585					SEP	1998	3	4					239	253		10.1023/A:1008857509595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008857509595													WOS:000078397200001

Particularly, we consider a more realistic problem formulation in which the link capacities of a general-topology packet network are discrete variables. This Discrete Capacity Assignment (DCA) problem can be classified as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem. A refined TCP/IP traffic modeling technique is also considered in order to estimate performance metrics for networks loaded by realistic traffic patterns. We propose a discrete variable Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) procedure to find solutions for the problem. A simple approach called Bottleneck Link Heuristic (BLH) is also proposed to obtain admissible solutions in a fast way. The PSO performance, compared to that one of an exhaustive search (ES) procedure, suggests that the PSO algorithm provides a quite efficient approach to obtain (near) optimal solutions with small computational effort.

It has broad application prospects in networked multi-agent control system (NMACS) due to its strong robustness, good response speed, and anti-interference ability. Discrete sliding mode variable structure control based on discrete systems has the advantages of SMPC, but due to the influence of discrete reaching law and sampling period of discrete systems, the system control often exhibits chattering. To overcome the chattering problem of SMPC, this paper designs an adaptive discrete sliding mode predictive control (ADSMPC) scheme based on incremental models, and by designing a leader-follower scheme achieved consistency control of multiple agents. The effectiveness of the control scheme is verified through multi-agents trajectory tracking experiments of a networked multi-lighting control system based on a dSPACE controller.

These kinds of short peptides with protonated lysines can complex with anionic heteropoly acids (HPAs) to form a stable gel in water/ethanol mixed solution. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the short peptides adopted a mixed conformation (beta-sheet and random-coil) within the gel matrix. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the heteropoly acids, acting as nanosized cross-linkers, first initiated the self-assembly of the cationic peptides into spherical nanostructures. Then these nanospheres accumulated with each other through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions to form large sheet-like assemblies, which further interconnected with each other forming continuous 3D network structures. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the structural integrity of the HPAs was maintained during the gelation process. The resultant hybrid gels showed reversible photo- and elecrtro-chromic properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the hybrid gels, capable of persistent and reversible changes of their colour, are attributed to the intervalence charge-transfer transition of the HPAs. Reversible information writing and erasing were demonstrated through a repeated photo-lithograph or electric stimuli without significant loss of the gel performance.

Continuous markets are expected to be the most appropriate design option during the early stages of local flexibility markets, where insufficient liquidity can hinder market development. At the same time, increasingly loaded distribution systems require to explicitly consider network constraints in local flexibility market clearing in order to help resolve rather than aggravate local network problems, such as line congestion and voltage issues. This paper defines the essential design considerations, introduces the local flexibility market clearing algorithm, and - aiming to establish a starting point for future research - discusses design options and research challenges that emerge during this procedure which require further investigation.

J	Yu, WJ; Shao, GF				Yu, Wenjing; Shao, Gaofeng			Morphology engineering of defective graphene for microwave absorption	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												Graphene with abundant defects has been considered as the most lightweight electromagnetic functional materials. Although important, the dominant electromagnetic response of defective graphene with diverse morphologies is rarely the focus of existing research. Herein, the defective graphene with two-dimensional planar structure (2D-ps) and three-dimensional continuous network (3D-cn) morphologies were dexterously designed with 2D mixing and 3D filled systems of polymeric matrix. A comparison between the topologies of defective graphene-based nanofillers and the microwave attenuation behav-iors was examined. Defective graphene with 3D-cn morphology can achieve ultralow filling content and broadband absorption, which is attributed to the presence of numerous pore structures that promote impedance matching, induce continuous conduction loss and provide multiple reflection and scattering sites for electromagnetic wave attenuation. Comparatively, by virtue of the increased filling content of 2D-ps, the dielectric losses primarily originate from the dielectric genes, including aggregation -induced-charge transport, abundant defect and dipole polarization, resulting in good microwave absorp-tion at low thickness and low frequency. Therefore, this work provides a pioneering insight into morphol-ogy engineering of defective graphene microwave absorbers, and it will guide future exploration of customizing high-performance microwave absorption materials based on graphene-based low -dimensional building blocks.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Optimizing V2X Communication: Spectrum Resource Allocation and Power Control Strategies for Next-Generation Wireless Technologies	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												The upcoming wireless technology developments in the next generations are expected to substantially transform the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network. The challenge of limited spectrum resources in V2X communication, caused by the need for high data rates, necessitates a thorough analysis of spectrum resource allocation and power control. This complex problem falls under the domain of mixed-integer nonlinear programming; a strategic approach is implemented to overcome these issues, which divides the main challenge into two sub-problems. The issue of resource allocation is addressed by implementing a multiaccess spectrum allocation method, which is deliberately designed to optimize the utilization of the spectrum resources that are currently accessible. Concurrently, the power control issue is resolved by employing a continuous convex approximation technique, which effectively converts non-convex power-allocation issues into convex equivalents. This approach helps to alleviate interference between users. Finally, the simulation results prove that the proposed approaches can improve vehicle performance. The algorithms proposed in this article significantly improve the system throughput and access rate of vehicular user equipment (VUEs) while ensuring the data rate of cellular user equipment (CUEs).					.M.A.Ibrahim, Ali/IYJ-4158-2023	.M.A.Ibrahim, Ali/0000-0001-6363-4738														2076-3417				JAN	2024	14	2							531	10.3390/app14020531	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app14020531													WOS:001149179900001

Based on a non-decomposed constant variation formula, and the theories of semi-flow and metric dynamical systems, the existence of a unique weighted pseudo 0-almost periodic sequence solution is addressed to the discrete space and time stochastic inertial neural networks. Further, a guaranteed cost controller is designed to complete a global exponential stabilization for this discrete networks by establishing a framework of drive, response and error networks.

Longitudinal social network analysis of avian mycobacteriosis incidence in a large population of zoo birds	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE												The goal of this study was to evaluate longitudinal patterns of avian mycobacteriosis spread through a social network. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether the patterns of connectivity over time can predict future infections, and whether this pattern can distinguish between different sources of infection. The study population included 13,409 individuals nested in a larger population of birds that were closely monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014). A retrospective cohort study design and social network connectivity were used to estimate the association between exposure to an infected bird, and development of mycobacteriosis. Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed from histopathology and network connectivity was defined by enclosure histories over discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined whether exposure to infected birds, both directly- and indirectly-connected, was associated with development of mycobacteriosis at the next time step. Our adjusted model showed an increased odds of developing mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 2.15; 95 % CI: 1.48 3.12; p < 0.001) for birds that were directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to another infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was independently associated with an increased risk of mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 1.56; 95 % CI: 1.11 2.19). This association persisted in adjusted models even when the indirect contacts were housed in distinctly different aviaries and never had contact with the subject of interest or its environment. Adjusted, risk-stratified models further characterized the type of exposure that increased the risk of avian mycobacteriosis. Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more likely to develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries and those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of the contact (same species versus different species) were also significant predictors of disease risk. Some findings were sensitive to model variation of time divisions and initiation time. Our study shows avian mycobacteriosis spread through the social network in quantifiable and discernable patterns. We provide empirical evidence that a contagious process drives some of the observed infection, but we also show low transmissibility based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time even when large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be effective at reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while enhancing population sustainability.

However, the high failure rate of WECSs leads to expensive costs for the maintenance of WECSs. Therefore, how to detect and isolate the faults of WECSs with stochastic dynamics is the pressing issue in the literature. This paper proposes a novel comprehensive fault detection and isolation (FDI) method for WECSs. First, a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) controller is studied to construct the closed-loop system of the WECS. This controller is based on the Markov-jump linear model, which could precisely establish the stochastic dynamics of the WECS. Meanwhile, the SMPC controller has satisfied control performance for the WECS. Second, based on the closed-loop system with SMPC, the stochastic hybrid estimator (SHE) is designed to estimate the continuous and discrete states of the WECS. Compared with the existing estimators for WECSs, the proposed estimator is more suitable for WECSs since it considers both the continuous and discrete states of WECSs. In addition, the proposed estimator is robust to the fault input. Finally, with the proposed estimator, the comprehensive FDI method is given to detect and isolate the actuators' faults of the WECS. Both the system status and the actuators' faults can be detected by the FDI method and it can effectively quantify the actuators' fault by the fault residuals. The simulation results suggest that the SHE could effectively estimate the hybrid states of the WECS, and the proposed FDI method gives satisfied fault detection performance for the actuators of the WECS.

For establishing the noise aware design strategy and methodology, a full-system level noise coupling simulation technique is evaluated on the demonstrator representing a multi-chip mixedsignal PCB. In an experimental scenario, an IC chip (Aggressor IC) operates the NS to generate power noise and the OCM measures the voltage fluctuation of the power delivery network (PDN) within the chip. On the other hand, another IC (Victim IC) holds the NS in no operation while uses the OCM to monitor its PDN voltage fluctuation caused by the conducted noise from the aggressor IC. For the verification of simulation accuracy, two chip power models (CPM), package wire models, discrete de-cap models and a single PCB model are combined into a chippackage-system (CPS) integrated model. The simulation was performed in about 2 hours for CPS integrated noise simulation including S-parameter extraction of the PCB. It is demonstrated that the full-system model with the two CPMs successfully simulates chip-to-chip active noise coupling, namely noise propagation from internal circuits of an aggressor chip to those on a victim chip. The chip-to-chip noise coupling simulation exhibited good agreements with measurements in case studies. The simulation methodology enables conductive noise aware design for multi-chip mixed-signal PCB in its design stage.

The ability of L to form coordination polymers was explored with various metal salts under different conditions. Six complexes of L-[Cu-2(L)I-2], 1; [Cu-2(L)I-2], 2; [Cd-3(L)Cl-6 center dot 2DMF], 3; [Cu(L)Cl-2], 4; [Zn(L)I-2 center dot MeOH], 5; and [Cd(L)(NO3)(2)center dot H2O]center dot 2THF, 6 have been synthesized by the reaction of L with the corresponding metal salts at room temperature, either by direct mixing or by a layering technique. Single crystal X-ray analyses revealed that complexes 1 and 2 are isomers of each other and that both contain Cu2I2 building units. The crystal structure of 1 contains a discrete unit that contains a strong Cu(I)center dot center dot center dot arene interaction, whereas, in 2, the Cu2I2 units act as a linear linker and form a one-dimensional zigzag chain. Complex 3 exhibits a two-dimensional layer in which the ID polymeric chains of halide bridged Cd(II) ions are linked by the organic ligand L. The crystal structures of 4 and 5 contain a ID zigzag chain and a discrete hydrogen bonded dimer, respectively. The crystal structure of complex 6 contains nitrate as a counterion and forms an interesting one-dimensional helical chain containing cavities that are occupied by THF molecules. In these crystal structures, the ligand L is found to exhibit four different conformations. The Cambridge Structural Database was used to rationalize the results obtained here and to provide some insight into the metal coordination geometries, the halide bridging of metal centers, as well as metal center dot center dot center dot arene interactions.

On 2-Angular-Coverage in Wireless Visual Sensor Network Deployment for 3D Indoor Monitoring	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOUTHEAST CONFERENCE ACM SE'17					ACM Southeast Regional Conference	APR 13-17, 2017	Kennesaw, GA	Kennesaw State Univ				Extensive efforts have been devoted to achieve k-coverage for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployed in the sensing area by considering omni-directional sensing ranges as seen in scalar temperature sensors, where the larger k is, fault tolerance and monitoring quality is better. However, in wireless visual sensor networks (WVSNs), the sensing range of a visual sensor is often directional and modeled as a convex triangular shape in 2D and a pyramid-shape in 3D, which renders the k-coverage solutions proposed for WSNs incapable of solving the problem in WVSNs. Moreover, a number of WVSN applications consider 3D indoor space monitoring, which makes previous solutions proposed for 2D WVSN coverage less effective. In this paper, we take an initial step to tackle this challenging problem by considering 2-coverage for WVSNs in 3D indoor space monitoring. To maximize the information that can be captured by 2 visual sensors covering a 3D location, we propose to deploy the visual sensors from different directional angles and further extend 2-coverage to "2-angular-coverage" to denote such unique requirements in WVSNs. We demonstrate our simulated WVSN testing platform which emulates a 3D space and highlights our objective to provide efficient 2-angular-coverage in the indoor environment by minimizing the number of visual sensors required to cover the full regions through precision angle view monitoring. We formulate the general problem in a continuous space and then discretize our model via a lattice based approach. In addition, we also create a strategy to determine the degree of coverage for the WVSN, where a given location needs to be covered by at least 2 visual sensors that fulfill the angular-coverage requirement. We design an efficient greedy heuristic and an enhanced-Depth First Search algorithm to solve the discrete version problem, where the latter, if given enough time can return an optimal solution. By extensive simulations, we demonstrate that both our solutions can achieve superior performance on minimizing the number of required visual sensors for 2-angular-coverage in 3D indoor space monitoring.

A filter structure is proposed to construct the residual model for fault detection. For the limited network resources, a novel event-triggered strategy is employed to decrease the amount of data that is transmitted from the sensor to the filter. With the consideration of stochastic model and limited network resources, a novel event-based method is designed to ensure the residual system is stochastically stable and satisfies the desired fault sensitivity level and disturbance attenuation level.

Philip			Adaptive Sensor Fault Detection and Identification Using Particle Filter Algorithms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS												Sensor fault detection and identification (FDI) is a process of detecting and validating sensor's fault status. Because FDI guarantees system reliable performance, it has received much attention recently. In this paper, we address the problem of online sensor fault identification and validation. For a physical sensor validation system, it contains transitions between sensor normal and faulty states, change of system parameters, and a fusion of noisy readings. A common dynamic state-space model with continuous state variables and observations cannot handle this problem. To circumvent this limitation, we adopt a Markov switch dynamic state-space model to simulate the system: we use discrete-state variables to model sensor states and continuous variables to track the change of the system parameters. Problems in Markov switch dynamic state-space model can be well solved by particle filters, which are popularly used in solving problems in digital communications. Among them, mixture Kalman filter (MKF) and stochastic M-algorithm (SMA) have very good performance, both in accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we plan to incorporate these two algorithms into the sensor validation problem, and compare the effectiveness and complexity of MKF and SMA methods under different situations in the simulation with an existing algorithm-interactive multiple models.

While providing many insights into brain functions, the block design adds more manipulation in functional network analysis that may reduce the purity of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal. Recent studies utilized one single long run for task trials of the same condition, the so-called continuous design, to investigate functional connectivity based on task functional magnetic resonance imaging. Continuous brain activities associated with the single-task condition can be directly utilized for task-related functional connectivity assessment, which has been examined for working memory, sensory, motor, and semantic task experiments in previous research. But it remains unclear how the block and continuous design influence the assessment of task-related functional connectivity networks. This study aimed to disentangle the separable effects of block/continuous design and working memory load on task-related functional connectivity networks, by using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Across 50 young healthy adults, behavioral results of accuracy and reaction time showed a significant main effect of design as well as interaction between design and load. Imaging results revealed that the cingulo-opercular, fronto-parietal, and default model networks were associated with not only task activation, but significant main effects of design and load as well as their interaction on intra- and inter-network functional connectivity and global network topology.

J	Liu, MQ				Liu MeQin			Unified stabilizing controller synthesis approach for discrete-time intelligent systems with time delays by dynamic output feedback	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES F-INFORMATION SCIENCES												A novel model, termed the standard neural network model (SNNM), is advanced to describe some delayed (or non-delayed) discrete-time intelligent systems composed of neural networks and Takagi and Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models. The SNNM is composed of a discrete-time linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator. Based on the global asymptotic stability analysis of the SNNMs, linear and nonlinear dynamic output feedback controllers are designed for the SNNMs to stabilize the closed-loop systems, respectively. The control design equations are shown to be a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved by various convex optimization algorithms to determine the control signals. Most neural-network-based (or fuzzy) discrete-time intelligent systems with time delays or without time delays can be transformed into the SNNMs for controller synthesis in a unified way. Three application examples show that the SNNMs not only make controller synthesis of neural-network-based (or fuzzy) discrete-time intelligent systems much easier, but also provide a new approach to the synthesis of the controllers for the other type of nonlinear systems.																			1009-2757					AUG	2007	50	4					636	656		10.1007/s11432-007-0043-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-007-0043-4													WOS:000249266300011

By considering packet dropouts and network-induced delays separately, new models for discrete-time NCSs with faults are established. Based on the established models, fault detection filter design criteria are proposed to asymptotically stabilize the residual systems in the sense of mean-square and preserve a guaranteed performance. When transferring nonlinear matrix inequalities into a solvable optimization problem, new bounding inequalities are proposed to introduce less conservatism. The designed fault detection filters can ensure the sensitivity of the residual signal with respect to faults, and robustness of the considered systems with respect to data drift. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.					han, qing/KCZ-0174-2024; Han, Qing-Long/B-6635-2013	Han, Qing-Long/0000-0002-7207-0716													1948-9439		978-1-4577-2072-7				2012							2472	2477																WOS:000323966202103

The resistively loaded antennas are based on the Altshuler discrete resistive loading approach. The distance from the loading point to the feeding point and the resistance has been optimized; in addition, a balun at the feeding point was introduced to convert the unbalanced signal from the coax to balanced signal. Test results show that the manufactured antennas have a wide bandwidth frequency range from 55 to 275 MHz. A laboratory experiment using the developed system was conducted in a building with high ceilings. The results registered all basic features including the ground, sub-ground surface, and the lamp hanging from the ceiling. Numerical modeling by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method using two-dimensional (2-D) transverse electric (TE) verifies the presence of these registered features in the measured airborne data. A bedrock outcrop in ice sheet model is reconstructed based on a piece of real airborne GPR data, the modeling profile results show excellent consistent with the observed data.

However, the input signals of real-world communication systems obey discrete distributions. Furthermore, apart from the capacity, another ultimate performance metric of a communication system is its symbol error ratio (SER). In this article, we pursue a radically new approach to PHYS by considering rigorous direct SER optimization exploiting the discrete nature of practical modulated signals. Specifically, we propose a secure precoding technique based on a multi-objective SER criterion, which aims for minimizing the confidential messages' SER at their legitimate user, while maximizing the SER of the confidential messages leaked to the illegitimate user. The key to this challenging multi-objective optimization problem is to introduce a priority factor that controls the priority of directly minimizing the SER of the legitimate user against directly maximizing the SER of the leaked confidential messages. Furthermore, we define a new metric termed as the security-level, which is related to the conditional symbol error probability of the confidential messages leaked to the illegitimate user. Additionally, we also introduce the secure discrete-input continuous-output memoryless channel (DCMC) capacity referred to as secure-DCMC-capacity, which serves as a classical security metric of the confidential messages, given a specific discrete modulation scheme. The impacts of both the channel's Rician factor and the correlation factor of antennas on the security-level and the secure-DCMC-capacity are investigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed priority-aware secure precoding based on the direct SER metric is capable of securing transmissions, even in the challenging scenario, where the eavesdropper has three receive antennas, while the legitimate user only has a single one.

A long-standing, intertwined question is that of inverse design: how to compute a design that satisfies a desired target performance? Here, we show that the piecewise linear property, very common in everyday neural networks, allows for an inverse design formulation based on mixed-integer linear programming. Our mixed-integer inverse design uncovers globally optimal or near optimal solutions in a principled manner. Furthermore, our method significantly facilitates emerging, but challenging, combinatorial inverse design tasks, such as material selection. For problems where finding the optimal solution is intractable, we develop an efficient yet near-optimal hybrid approach. Eventually, our method is able to find solutions provably robust to possible fabrication perturbations among multiple designs with similar performances.

Like bitmapped workstations, multimedia provides a more familiar environment to the users. Achieving this potential requires the development of programming environments with integrated support for multimedia. Suite-Sound is one such environment SuiteSound is built in the Suite object-based system on a conventional UNIX operating system. SuiteSound objects incorporate multimedia by creating flows and filters. Flows are streams of multimedia data moving through a sequence of objects. They bridge the gap between objects representing the state of an entity at a discrete point in time and space and continuous media such as live audio or video. Filters are intermediate objects between the source and destination of a flow. They take a flow as input, perform one of several operations such as multiplex-in, multiplex-out, gain control, or silence deletion on it, and send the resulting flow to its destination. In effect, they provide a virtual device interface for the application programmer that is uniform and independent of any physical device. This paper describes the design and implementation of SuiteSound on the Sun SparcStation. We perform experiments to determine the network and CPU load of the sound tool, detail experiences using the SuiteSound environment and applications, and suggest future work.

The spatiotemporal profile and adaptation determine the joint effects and interactions of multiple stressors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE												Background Biodiversity is declining worldwide as ecosystems are increasingly threatened by multiple stressors associated with anthropogenic global change. Stressors frequently co-occur across scales spatially and temporally, resulting in joint effects that are additive or non-additive, i.e., antagonism or synergism. Forecasting and counteracting threats from intensifying stressors requires improved mechanistic understanding of joint effects, which is currently relatively low. To date, research on multiple stressors has been biased toward simplified scenarios, emphasized classification of interactions over realized joint effects, and mostly ignored adaptation (i.e., phenotypic plasticity or evolving life-history traits) of organisms. To investigate if more a realistic scenarios design incorporating complex spatiotemporal stressor profiles and adaption change joint effects and interactions of multiple stressors compared to simplified scenarios, we modified a spatially explicit meta-population model for a generic freshwater insect. We used the model to simulate different, hypothetical spatiotemporal profiles of a continuous and a discrete stressor and evaluated their joint effects and interactions. Agricultural land use represented the continuous stressor impacting meta-population patch quality and network connectivity and related scenarios implied different trajectories. Climatic events represented the discrete stressor impacting all patches simultaneously by temporary mortality events, with related scenarios implying different event severity. Adaptation mitigated the effects of climatic events based on previous events.Results Excluding adaptation, we found that at higher levels of the discrete stressor (i.e., strong and frequent climatic events) it strongly dominates the joint effects, while at a low level (i.e., weak and infrequent climatic events) of the discrete stressor, the continuous stressor (i.e., land use) dominates. Yet, the continuous stressor always defined the interaction type, with decreasing land use stress leading to antagonism, and increasing land use stress leading to synergism. Adaptation reduced joint effects under decreasing land use stress, yet had little compensatory influence under increasing land use stress. Moreover, adaptation changed interaction sizes inconsistently across the different land use and climate scenarios, with change depending on the climate scenario. Here, interactions decreased in the moderate scenario but increased in the severe and intense scenarios.Conclusions We highlight that realistic stressor scenarios accounting for potential adaptation are critical for a mechanistic understanding of how species respond to global change. To our knowledge, this is the first modeling study to show that stressor interactions depend on complex spatiotemporal stressor profiles and adaptation, following general principles.																			2190-4707	2190-4715				JUN 21	2024	36	1							118	10.1186/s12302-024-00945-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-024-00945-2													WOS:001251550100001

These benefits are traditionally quantified by emission models, which in general account for vehicle speeds, traffic flows and emission coefficients. An alternative approach for approximating the environmental impact of traffic is developed. This approach finds the route that keeps the most balanced speed profile throughout the route, which contributes to fuel consumption reduction. The paper formulates an optimization problem that includes the described approach for the DNDP.

J	Chen, DL; Luo, YQ; Yuan, XG				Chen, Danlei; Luo, Yiqing; Yuan, Xigang			Refrigeration system synthesis based on de-redundant model by particle swarm optimization algorithm	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Simultaneous optimization of refrigeration system (RS) and its heat exchanger network (HEN) leads to a large-scale non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Conventionally, researchers usually adopted simplifications to confine problem scale from being too large at the cost of reducing solution space. This study established an optimization framework for the simultaneous optimization of RS and HEN. Firstly, A more comprehensive and compact model was developed to guarantee a relatively complete solution space while reducing model scale as well as its solving difficulty. In this model, a tandem arrangement of connecting sub-coolers and expansion valves was considered in the superstructure; and the pressure/temperature levels were optimized as continuous variables. On this basis, we proposed a "two-step transformation method" to equivalently transform the cross-level structure into a non-cross-level structure, and the de-redundant superstructure was established with ensuring comprehensiveness and rigor. Furthermore, the MINLP model was developed and solved by Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Finally, our methodology was validated to get better optimal results with less CPU time in two case studies, an ethylene RS in an existing plant and a reported propylene RS.

J	Lou, YY; Yin, YF; Lawphongpanich, S				Lou, Yingyan; Yin, Yafeng; Lawphongpanich, Siriphong			Robust Approach to Discrete Network Designs with Demand Uncertainty	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												A discrete network design problem under demand uncertainty is considered. It is assumed that the future travel demand for each origin-destination (O-D) pair can take on nominal or one of several other values, where the probabilities of occurrence of these values are unknown. However, the vector of O-D demands realized for the network must belong to an uncertainty set, a set that allows demands for a group of O-D pairs to deviate from their nominal values simultaneously. A robust counterpart of deterministic discrete network design is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints under the Wardropian user equilibrium conditions. The algorithm proposed for the problem terminates in a finite number of iterations and converges to a global optimum solution under certain conditions. Numerical results that use two networks from the literature empirically demonstrate that the algorithm is effective and has the potential to solve realistic problems.																			0361-1981	2169-4052					2009		2090					86	94		10.3141/2090-10	http://dx.doi.org/10.3141/2090-10													WOS:000268737100010

The ability to innovate constantly amidst a turbulent and competitive environment is often the key force behind MNE survival and dominance. Design/methodology/approach - This study conducts an in-depth longitudinal study of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, a global manufacturing company in the tire and rubber industry. The findings are based on USPTO patent and trademark data from 1975-2005. Findings - The analysis reveals three crucial trends: the major role of continuous investment in innovation in the firm's survival and turnaround; the evolution of the firm's innovation network from a headquarters-centric model toward more geographical dispersal; and the changing mix of innovation from traditional "hard" science-based research toward a greater emphasis on "softer" competencies in design and trademarks. This third trend, in particular, opens up important new avenues for research on MNE innovation practices.

Closing loops in agricultural supply chains using multi-objective optimization: A case study of an industrial mushroom supply chain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS												Environmental concerns and scarcity of resources encourage decision makers in supply chains to consider alternative production options that include preventing the production of waste streams, and simultaneously reusing and recycling waste materials. Until now, hardly any quantitative modeling approaches exist in literature on closing loops in agri-food supply chains. In contrast to closed-loop studies in discrete parts industry, in agri-food supply chains the value of the final product itself cannot be regained. However, the components used for production such as organic matter or a growing medium, can be recycled. In this paper, the consequences of closing loops in a mushroom supply chain are revealed. We propose a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model to quantify trade-offs between economic and environmental indicators and explore quantitatively alternative recycling technologies. The model was developed to re-design the logistical structure and close loops in the mushroom supply chain. We found that adopting closing loop technologies in industrial mushroom production has the potential to increase total profitability of the chain by almost 11% while the environmental performance improves by almost 28%. We conclude that a comprehensive evaluation of recycling technologies and redesigning logistical structures requires quantitative tools that optimize simultaneously managerial decisions at strategic and tactical level.

Frequency-based zonal flexible bus design considering order cancellation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												Order cancellation is ubiquitous in on-demand mobility pre-booking systems, which affects the pricing and operational strategies of on-demand mobility services. This paper investigates the order cancellation behaviour in a frequency-based flexible bus (FB) system, which provides customized door-to-door service, considering stochastic elastic demand volume and stochastic spatial demand distribution. A two-stage stochastic model that simultaneously optimises the FB service price, FB dispatching, and passenger assignment is developed while capturing the effect of pre-booked order cancellation probability. This cancellation probability is calculated based on the pricing and availability of street-hailing taxi and FB services. The availability of FBs is derived from the underlying stochastic demand and order assignment process, which makes the model nonlinear. To solve the mixed integer nonlinear model, a two-phase decomposition scheme is employed, and then approximation techniques are implemented to make each decomposed problem solvable by commercial solvers. Finally, a gradient decent solution algorithm is applied. Numerical studies are conducted to show the necessity of capturing the impact of order cancellation and illustrate the influence of cancellation penalty, taxi price, and zone division. Finally, a case study with Chengdu data is implemented to examine the performance of our solution algorithm for large-scale optimisation.

In consideration with the imperfect networked environment with transmission delay and quantisation, a model of the error dependent networked closed-loop fault system is established. By constructing an appropriate delay-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the sufficient condition for the existence of robustfault-tolerant controller is obtained for an error dependent networked closed-loop fault system, and a co-design method for gaining the discrete event-triggered parameter andfault-tolerant controller is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Notice that the structure of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional which considers the piecewise-linear sawtooth structure characteristic of transmission delay, a less conservative result is obtained.

J	Kralj, AK; Glavic, P; Kravanja, Z				Kralj, AK; Glavic, P; Kravanja, Z			Retrofit of complex and energy intensive processes II: stepwise simultaneous superstructural approach	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Simultaneous parameter and structural optimization of an existing complex and energy intensive continuous process have been studied using rigorous models. The method that was recently developed to sequentially optimize retrofits has been extended to a stepwise simultaneous superstructural approach, using available process simulators and optimization software capabilities. An extended procedure has been employed for retrofits using a three-step approach: (i) generation of a process superstructure by pinch analysis; (ii) formulation of a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model and its simplification into a relaxed nonlinear programming (NLP) model; (iii) simultaneous optimization, first by a process simulator and than by the NLP algorithm. Pinch analysis offers alternative retrofit designs for postulating the superstructure. An advantage of the relaxed NLP formulation over the MINLP one is that it can be easily generated. Poor local optima due to nonlinear interconnections between alternative solutions have been avoided by applying a direct search complex algorithm using the simulator. The approach has been illustrated by maximizing the annual profit of an existing methanol plant. The optimal solution yields additional savings of 5.17 MUSD per annum (6.75% of the total income) which is 6.5 times the savings obtained by the earlier sequential optimization method.

J	Ivanov, B; Stoyanov, S				Ivanov, Boyan; Stoyanov, Stoyan			A mathematical model formulation for the design of an integrated biodiesel-petroleum diesel blends system	ENERGY												This paper addresses the strategic planning of an IBSC (integrated biofuel supply chain) using total annualized cost and total life cycle GHG (green house gas) emissions as economic and environmental criteria respectively. The IBSC for an extended planning horizon H (e.g. 10 years) is considered and horizon H is further subdivided into a set of discrete time intervals. For each of these subintervals the diesel and the biodiesel fuel consumption can be varied according to a predetermined value. A mixed-integer linear programming model of biodiesel production that takes into account infrastructure compatibility, demand distribution, size and location of biorefineries using the available biomass and carbon tax data is proposed. An important aspect of the proposed model is the inclusion of crop rotation conditions to assure the supply of biological feedstock. The price of biodiesel and any byproducts produced are included in the model. Inputs to the model are the quantity of biological feedstock, the cost of biomass transportation, as well as inventory and processing costs. The proposed model is illustrated in Part 2 of this work with an example of Bulgarian economy for planning period 2010 to 2020 when the objectives of the Renewable Energy Directive 28/2009/EC will be achieved.

Data-driven modeling of granular matter?s elastic nonlinearity by volume constraint	COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS												Traditional analytic homogenization methods of granular micromechanics limit the maximum predicted effective Poisson's ratio to at most 1/4 for strain-driven constitutive models. However, this prediction disagrees with both the experimental evidence and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of many granular materials. To resolve this problem, a novel data-driven and volume-constrained homogenization of nonlinear granular elasticity is proposed with only the incompressible-limit upper bound on Poisson's ratio of 1/2. Due to the volume constraint, the proposed formulation bears similarity to techniques in state-based peridynamics and, likewise, classical mixed finite elements. The new multiscale model is designed to be particularly advantageous for machine learning of effective moduli from DEM simulations (and other data sources) informed by the packings' topology, specifically the average number of intergranular contacts per grain (the coordination number). Self-consistent elastic solutions for structured granular packings supplement DEM data in model training in order to cover a larger parameter space, demonstrating the flexibility of the method. The homogenization approach is further developed to capture glass bead packs' semi-Hertzian nonlinearity. The designed utility for data-driven modeling is exemplified in the training of a micromechanically-sensitive input-convex neural network (ICNN) constitutive model applied in finite element analysis of an illustrative boundary value problem.						, Kane C.

Conventional satellites with fixed beam pattern and footprint planning may not be capable of meeting such dynamic requests and irregular traffic distributions. As the development of flexible satellite payload with beamforming capabilities, spot beams with flexible size and shape are considered potential solutions to this issue. As an early investigation, in this paper, we consider the scenarios where satellite payloads are equipped with multiple beam patterns and study the optimal beam pattern selection. We exploit the potential synergies of joint resource optimization between adaptive beam patterns and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in a LEO satellite system, where NOMA is employed to reduce intra-beam interference and flexible beam pattern is adopted to mitigate inter-satellite interference. The formulated problem is to minimize the capacity-demand gap of terminals, which falls into mixed-integer nonconvex programming (MINCP). To tackle the discrete variables and non-convexity, we design a joint approach to allocate power and select beam patterns. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves capacity-demand gap reduction of 37.8% over conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and 42.5% over the fixed-beam-pattern scheme.

In this regard, not only Genetic Algorithm (GA), Keshtel Algorithm (KA) and Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) are employed to solve the problem, but also a novel hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on the benefits of aforementioned algorithms is developed. Finally, by considering some efficient assessment metrics of Pareto-based algorithms, the results indicate that the proposed hybrid algorithm not only is more appropriate than the exact solver but it also outperforms the performance of individual ones particularly in medium- and large-sized problems.

Considering the pattern and variation of network traffic, some network components can be turned off during the periods with light load to save energy. However, turning off/on network devices adapting to traffic load may result in the reconfiguration of logical topology in optical wavelength routed networks. On the other hand, the traffic in future network is expected to show high heterogeneity on bandwidth requirement. With flexibility on network provisioning, Mixed Line Rate (MLR) scheme is proposed as a promising candidate to support heterogeneous traffic demand. In this paper, we study the logical topology design of IP-over-WDM network with mixed line rates. We formulate the multi-period logical topology design problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model with the objective to minimize the overall network power consumption and the reconfiguration overhead between consecutive time periods. Then the proposed model is evaluated and compared with conventional schemes.																					978-1-4799-8498-5				2015							99	103																WOS:000375231000125

Robust unified dissipativity vibration control design for offshore steel jacket platform in ocean environments under self-excited nonlinear wave force	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												This paper addresses the challenge of delayed proportional integral control (DPIC) of an offshore steel jacket platform (OSJP) subjected to a self-excited nonlinear wave force and structural uncertainty using the unified criteria. By introducing discrete and distributed state delays in the control input, a DPIC was established to stabilize the OSJPs. The goal of this study is to design a proper controller that will stabilize the dynamic of an OSJP while subjected to structural uncertainty and nonlinear wave force. The OSJP is investigated as a nonlinear dynamics with mixed state delays, allowing us to study its robust asymptotic stability using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) in the context of the extended dissipativity performance index. A novel closed-loop system-based stability criterion is derived as a result of using tighter integral inequalities to estimate the upper bounds of the delay and influential control gains can be achieved if a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is checked by simulation results, that the proposed control scheme can significantly improve the control's performance. Finally, it was demonstrated that the proposed control approach is more effective and multi-dynamic performances have been illustrated through the comparisons to previously published results in the literature.(c) 2023 The Franklin Institute.

Unlike conventional harmonic manipulation approaches, combinations of parallel and seriesLCresonant circuits are utilized to build the matching networks as it can generate frequency-dependent components and locate the varying impedance of continuous mode. With a proper design, the impedance variation in frequency domain can be mapped to the frequency response of the matching network at the fundamental frequency and the second harmonic simultaneously. Matching network design procedures are demonstrated and results show that the frequency response of the network has very good approximation with the desired continuous mode conditions. A prototype PA is implemented on 0.25-mu m gallium nitride (GaN) MMIC process, and tested with both continuous-wave and modulated signals.

The new design tool gathers the simplified real frequency technique of broadbanding with an appropriate application of algebraic network decomposition and replacement techniques. The proposed design method naturally incorporates the outstanding merits of modern broadbanding techniques of single variable. That is, in the course of design algorithm, there is no need to choose a circuit topology with mixed elements in advance, nor is it necessary to invent a realizable transfer function in two variables to measure the system performance. Examples are presented to exhibit the application of the proposed design tool.

We use a discrete-time system model with uncertainties to decipt the time-varying TCP networks. Based on the model, an asymptotically stable sliding surface is designed by linear matrix inequality (LMI). The design of sliding surface compensates for the disadvantageous effect of uncertainties. Therefore, the robustness of the algorithm is good. The proposed controller can guarantee the controlled object, namely, the queue length in router to converge to the desired value quickly and constrain oscillation of the queue length effectively. The simulation results certify the validity of the algorithm.																					978-86-85195-54-9				2007							393	+																WOS:000251017900075

The problem of level set approximation plays a vital role in solving problems, for instance in fault detection in water distribution systems, engineering design, parameter identification in gene regulatory networks, and in drug discovery. The goal is to create algorithms that quickly converge to feasible solutions and then achieve a good coverage of the level set. The population based search scheme of evolutionary algorithms makes this type of algorithms well suited to target such problems. In this paper, the focus is on continuous black box functions and we propose a challenging benchmark for this problem domain and propose dual mutation strategies, that balance between global exploration and local refinement. Moreover, the article investigates the role of different indicators for measuring the coverage of the level set approximation. The results are promising and show that even for difficult problems in moderate dimension the proposed evolutionary level set approximation algorithm (ELSA) can serve as a versatile and robust meta-heuristic.

A UHF class-E/F-2 power amplifier (PA), which includes a lumped element drain terminating network to synthesize the optimal load modulation (LM) trajectory, has been designed to maintain an efficiency as high as possible along an output power control range above 10 dB. Based on this PA, an outphasing scheme in the 700 MHz frequency band has been implemented. It is shown to provide an efficiency higher than 60% up to an output power below 5% (-13 dB) of its peak value (47 W). Under mixed-mode operation and applying digital predistorsion (DPD), a 10 MHz LTE signal with a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) as high as 12.2 dB has been linearly reproduced with average efficiency and PAE values of 46.6% and 42.9%, respectively.

It is assumed that the cost of each potential link construction follows a certain stochastic distribution. In this paper, a bi-level stochastic programming model for DNDP is proposed, in which the upper-level model is a chance constrain model with the objective function of minimizing the total travel costs in the network; the lower-level model is a user equilibrium model. A genetic algorithm is designed to solve the model in an efficient way. A comprehensive computational experiment is conducted to illustrate the correctness and efficiency of the model and the algorithm proposed in this paper. The result shows that the uncertain model is more flexible and practical than the deterministic one. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Meng, M; Li, XX				Meng, Min; Li, Xiuxian			On the linear convergence of distributed Nash equilibrium seeking for multi-cluster games under partial-decision information	AUTOMATICA												This paper considers the distributed strategy design for Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking in multi -cluster games under a partial-decision information scenario. In the considered game, there are multiple clusters and each cluster consists of a group of agents. A cluster is viewed as a virtual noncooperative player that aims to minimize its local payoff function and the agents in a cluster are the actual players that cooperate within the cluster to optimize the payoff function of the cluster through communication via a connected graph. In our setting, agents have only partial-decision information, that is, they only know their own local cost functions, local feasible strategy sets and strategies of neighboring agents. To solve the NE seeking problem of this formulated game, a discrete-time distributed algorithm, called distributed projected gradient tracking algorithm (DPGT), is devised based on the inter-and intra-communication of clusters. In the designed algorithm, each agent is equipped with strategy variables including its own strategy and estimates of other clusters' strategies. With the help of a weighted Frobenius norm and a weighted Euclidean norm, theoretical analysis is presented to rigorously show the linear convergence of the algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed algorithm.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Stability analysis and output-feedback synthesis of hybrid systems affected by piecewise constant parameters via dynamic resetting scalings	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS												We develop novel criteria for robust stability of a class of hybrid systems that are affected by piecewise constant uncertain parameters with dwell-time constraints. These criteria result from clock-dependent Lyapunov arguments that are based on several new robust stability conditions for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems which are affected by parametric passive uncertainties and do not admit any discrete dynamics. In contrast to other approaches, our stability analysis results rely on separation techniques from robust control involving dynamic resetting scalings. Moreover, these techniques are expected to pave the way for covering much more general uncertainties within the framework of integral quadratic constraints. Building upon the new insights on robust stability, we are able to propose an output-feedback gain-scheduling design methodology similarly to our recently obtained synthesis result involving dynamic resetting D-scalings. Most of the obtained conditions are expressed as infinite-dimensional (differential) linear matrix inequalities which can be numerically solved by using relaxation methods based on, e.g., linear splines or matrix sum-of-squares. We apply our results to obtain novel stability criteria and to design distributed controllers for networked systems over undirected switching topologies. Finally, the approach is illustrated with several numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kavuran, G				Kavuran, Gurkan			When machine learning meets fractional-order chaotic signals: detecting dynamical variations	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS												The challenge of classifying multivariate time series generated by discrete and continuous dynamical systems according to their chaotic or non-chaotic behavior has been studied extensively in the literature. The examination of noise or the variation of variables that affect a dynamic system's chaoticity will not be beneficial in analyzing structures employing random number generators (RNG) that are already assured to be chaotic. However, detecting the structural changes and their time intervals in deterministic systems with proven chaoticity can contribute to the literature in encryption applications. Machine Learning algorithms provide flexible possibilities to analyze and predict manipulations that may occur in the dynamics of chaotic and complex systems. This study proposes a deep Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network with a classification process to predict dynamical changes in a fractional-order chaotic (FOC) system. First, the appropriate system parameters are calculated to satisfy the chaotic behavior in the fractional-order Chen system. The predictive-corrective Adams-Bashforth-Moulton algorithm is used to simulate the FOC Chen system in the time domain. The Lyapunov exponents of the system were obtained according to the Wolf method. Next, three different scenarios have been designed to test and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Synthetic FOC signals obtained after sub-sampling and statistical feature extraction processes fed the input of the deep bidirectional L STM (BiL STM) network to perform the training and testing process. The classification performance for "q" and "c" classes reaches 100% with the proposed model. The overall average testing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score and MCC are 98%, 98%, 99.3%, 98.1%, 98%, and 97.3%, respectively.

A stability-economic model was developed to estimate the ore-skin thickness that can be left unmined to maintain the integrity of an open stope and control excessive ore dilition from hangingwall sloughage. The first stage of the approach consists of performing a cost-profit analysis to determine an economic break-even ore-skin thickness. The second stage includes using discrete element numerical methods to evaluate the stability of a certain ore-skin thickness. Two numerical methods were employed for this assessment, including a discrete fracture network (DEN) method and a hybrid discrete element / discrete fracture network model. Results indicated that the minimum ore-skin thickness required depends on the quality of governed rock mass and can be a function of stope lifetime. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our method generates p-cycles directly in one-step using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model. Cost-effective transponders and distance-adaptive line rates are provisioned for every p-cycle to minimize joint cost of transponders and spare capacity. The design problem is solved together with spectral clustering based graph partitioning, which permits to compute the optimal solution in independent sub-graphs concurrently.

Specifically, to approximate the lumped system uncertainty including the friction torque and self-aligning torque, the neural network is employed. To improve the steering tracking performance, the discrete-time identification model is proposed so that the tracking error and modeling error can be utilized to adjust the neural network updating law. Then, the unknown compound disturbances caused by external disturbance, Euler approximation errors and neural network approximation error are restrained by two DOs. Finally, the Lyapunov stability theory shows that the system tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded. Both numerical simulations and experiments are implemented to show the superiority of the proposed controller.																			0957-4174	1873-6793				NOV 30	2021	183								115395	10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115395		JUN 2021											WOS:000691816100003

J	Parbo, J; Nielsen, OA; Prato, CG				Parbo, Jens; Nielsen, Otto Anker; Prato, Carlo Giacomo			User perspectives in public transport timetable optimisation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												The present paper deals with timetable optimisation from the perspective of minimising the waiting time experienced by passengers when transferring either to or from a bus. Due to its inherent complexity, this bi-level minimisation problem is extremely difficult to solve mathematically, since timetable optimisation is a non-linear non-convex mixed integer problem, with passenger flows defined by the route choice model, whereas the route choice model is a non-linear non-continuous mapping of the timetable. Therefore, a heuristic solution approach is developed in this paper, based on the idea of varying and optimising the offset of the bus lines. Varying the offset for a bus line impacts the waiting time passengers experience at any transfer stop on the bus line. In the bi-level timetable optimisation problem, the lower level is a transit assignment calculation yielding passengers' route choice. This is used as weight when minimising waiting time by applying a Tabu Search algorithm to adapt the offset values for bus lines. The updated timetable then serves as input in the following transit assignment calculation. The process continues until convergence. The heuristic solution approach was applied on the large-scale public transport network in Denmark, The timetable optimisation approach yielded a yearly reduction in weighted waiting time equivalent to approximately 45 million Danish kroner (9 million USD).

This research was conducted as a commissioned research for a Finnish pharmaceutical wholesaler. In wholesale, logistics process is an important part of the core competencies and optimizing this process can provide significant competitive advantages. The objective of this research study was to investigate the causes of supply chain fragmentations and the ways to mitigate these effects. The central concepts are used as sustainable logistics process that minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, offers supply chain visibility, lean distribution channel, offers discrete event simulation and supply chain modelling. The empirical research employs a mixed research method consisting of both qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data is collected from the inbound deliveries of a Finnish pharmaceutical case company and qualitative data is gathered from a questionnaire survey within the case company. This study investigated the current inbound processes of the case company and compared to the developed model of the centralized pipeline system. The objective of this study was to investigate how a centralized logistic system minimizes travel cost to support environmental damage and can provide benefits to the inbound process of the case company. The research results indicated that a centralized pipeline system can provide improved information flow, higher freight capacity and reduced CO2 emissions to support environmental friendly and sustainable supply chain and logistics processes.

However, simple mix network designs are vulnerable to malicious mixes, which may drop or delay packets to facilitate traffic analysis attacks. Mix networks with provable robustness address this drawback through complex and expensive proofs of correct shuffling but come at a great cost and make limiting or unrealistic systems assumptions. We present Miranda, an efficient mix-net design, which mitigates active attacks by malicious mixes. Miranda uses both the detection of corrupt mixes, as well as detection of faults related to a pair of mixes, without detection of the faulty one among the two. Each active attack - including dropping packets - leads to reduced connectivity for corrupt mixes and reduces their ability to attack, and, eventually, to detection of corrupt mixes. We show, through experiments, the effectiveness of Miranda, by demonstrating how malicious mixes are detected and that attacks are neutralized early.

This is due to the large availability of big data from low-cost sensors with communication capabilities and advanced modeling tools such as deep learning. A promising method suitable for smart SHM is the analysis of acoustic emissions (AEs), i.e., ultrasonic waves generated by internal ruptures of the concrete when it is stressed. The advantage in respect to traditional ultrasonic measurement methods is the absence of the emitter and the suitability to implement continuous monitoring. The main purpose of this paper is to combine deep neural networks with bidirectional long short term memory and advanced statistical analysis involving instantaneous frequency and spectral kurtosis to develop an accurate classification tool for tensile, shear and mixed modes originated from AE events (cracks). We investigated effective event descriptors to capture the unique characteristics from the different types of modes. Tests on experimental results confirm that this method achieves promising classification among different crack events and can impact on the design of the future of SHM technologies. This approach is effective to classify incipient damages with 92% of accuracy, which is advantageous to plan maintenance.

Pump scheduling is vital to optimally operate the refined products pipelines. Existing studies mostly quantified the number of pump stop/restart in the form of cost, whereas the cost coefficient was often subjectively selected. The present study built a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model for refined products pipelines to minimize the number of pump stop/restart and reduce the pump running cost simultaneously. In this study, the minimum continuous running time of pumps, changing electricity price (i.e., time-changing electricity price and local electricity) and the pressure limits of special points were considered meticulously, e.g. high-elevation points, low-elevation points and pump stations. In the first stage, the improved augmented epsilon-constraint method (AUGMECON) was adopted to deal with this model, and obtained a seris of pump operating schemes, acting as a Pareto set. Then the results of the AUGMECON were evaluated by an established evaluation model based on neural network. Finally, two cases from a refined products pipeline system in China were employed to verify the practicability and accuracy of the proposed model. The results of this study can effectively guide the pump scheduling of refined products pipelines. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Artificial intelligence techniques complement classical methodologies and include concepts that simulate the way humans solve problems or how processes work in nature. In this work, the Fuzzy Logic system cancels the effects of load perturbances in an energy plant, by implementing a secondary controller which complements the main controller. The purpose of this paper is to use GA to tune this new secondary controller. The authors particularize the proposal for three specific applications: control the angular speed and position of a Direct Current (DC) motor and control the output voltage of a DC/DC buck converter. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use GA for tuning a Proportional-Integral Fuzzy Controller (PI-Fuzzy). The proposal defines a new objective function in comparison with literature approaches. The main key in the new objective function is combining the best features of Integral Square Error (ISE) function and taking out the overshoot response. Findings - In order to demonstrate the proposed methodology based on GA tuning a PI-Fuzzy, the authors apply the literature benchmark to the solution. The results are compared with the following techniques: Robust control, continuous PID control, discrete PID control, Optimal Control, Fuzzy Control and Artificial Neural Network based control. Comparisons are presented in terms of setting time and overshot. Originality/value - Results demonstrate that ISE or integral of absolute value of error function do not provide the desired response. Achieved results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposal to eliminate the overshoot of the traditional behaviour without lost any of the main features of the literature methodologies.

Since the resulting network structure featuring minimum utility consumption is not unique, other properties such as disturbance resistance have drawn more and more attention. In this article, a novel concept, Mixing Potential, is proposed to improve the disturbance resistance ability of the networks in the design stage. This concept originates from measuring the concentration fluctuation of a single sink, and could be calculated by its graphical and algorithmic definition, respectively. In addition, a sufficient condition for minimizing the Mixing Potential of a single sink has been proved. Based on this sufficient condition, a graphical and its corresponding algorithmic method are proposed to design the hydrogen and water networks with minimum utility consumption. Literature examples illustrate that the disturbance resistance ability of the network can be improved by adjusting the satisfying order of sinks.

In this article, a joint target and user assignment as well as dwell time and spectrum allocation strategy is proposed for the distributed radar-communication coexistence network. The optimization model is formulated as minimizing the sum of weighted position Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bounds under the dwell time and spectrum budgets while meeting the communication downlink requirements. The optimization model is shown to be a mixed-integer programming problem, where the binary assignment variables and continuous resource allocation variables are coupled in both the objective function and constraints. A three-stage alternate optimization method (TSAOM) is developed for problem solving. The target assignment and dwell time allocation (TADTA) problem and the user assignment and spectrum allocation (UASA) problem are separately relaxed as convex ones. Then, a cyclical minimizer framework is applied for the suboptimal solution. Simulations confirm the tracking performance improvement of the proposed strategy compared with two baseline allocation strategies. The results also show the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed TSAOM in comparison with the baseline algorithm.

A Lyapunov-based full state feedback neural network control structure is presented via backstepping, which solves the noncausal problem in the discrete-time backstepping design procedure. The closed-loop system is proven to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). An arbitrarily small tracking error can be achieved if the size of the neural network is chosen large enough, and the control performance of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by suitably choosing the design parameters.

Experimental Evolution Reveals Unifying Systems-Level Adaptations but Diversity in Driving Genotypes	MSYSTEMS												Genotype-fitness maps of evolution have been well characterized for biological components, such as RNA and proteins, but remain less clear for systems-level properties, such as those of metabolic and transcriptional regulatory networks. Here, we take multi-omits measurements of 6 different E. coli strains throughout adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to maximal growth fitness. The results show the following: (i) convergence in most overall phenotypic measures across all strains, with the notable exception of divergence in NADPH production mechanisms; (ii) conserved transcriptomic adaptations, describing increased expression of growth promoting genes but decreased expression of stress response and structural components; (iii) four groups of regulatory trade-offs underlying the adjustment of transcriptome composition; and (iv) correlates that link causal mutations to systems-level adaptations, including mutation-pathway flux correlates and mutation-transcriptome composition correlates. We thus show that fitness landscapes for ALE can be described with two layers of causation: one based on system-level properties (continuous variables) and the other based on mutations (discrete variables). IMPORTANCE Understanding the mechanisms of microbial adaptation will help combat the evolution of drug-resistant microbes and enable predictive genome design. Although experimental evolution allows us to identify the causal mutations underlying microbial adaptation, it remains unclear how causal mutations enable increased fitness and is often explained in terms of individual components (i.e., enzyme rate) as opposed to biological systems (i.e., pathways). Here, we find that causal mutations in E. coli are linked to systems-level changes in NADPH balance and expression of stress response genes. These systems-level adaptation patterns are conserved across diverse E. coli strains and thus identify cofactor balance and proteome reallocation as dominant constraints governing microbial adaptation.

J	Kaya, O				Kaya, Orhan			Development of Neural Network-Based Asphalt Mix Design Parameters Prediction Tool	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Mix design of asphalt concrete is carried out in order to produce a mixture of asphalt bitumen and aggregate that satisfies both minimum design requirements and cost-effectiveness. Marshall mix design, similar to other mix design methods, aims to determine an optimum mix for a given design criteria, having an optimum bitumen content, and has still been one of the most used asphalt mix design method in the world. Marshall mix design procedure requires significant amount of time and skilled workmanship for lengthy laboratory experiments. Time required for the mix design may negatively affect construction schedule especially during the peak construction season. In Marshall mix design procedure, optimum bitumen content is determined based on Marshall stability and flow test results, and other volumetric properties of the mixes. Prediction models that quickly predict all required Marshall mix design parameters based on very few numbers of input parameters requiring significantly less amount of time to obtain compared to the time needed to obtain all Marshall mix design parameters through lengthy laboratory experiments could be quite useful. In this study, artificial neural network-based prediction models based on the data of 200 asphalt mixes designed for asphalt wearing course, obtained from 5th district of the General Directorate of Highways of Turkey, were developed to predict all required Marshall mix design parameters. As part of the paper, a Microsoft Excel Macro-based tool, to be potentially used by 5th district of the General Directorate of Highways of Turkey, was also developed that makes prediction of all required mix design parameters for any given mix in seconds using the developed models and very few numbers of user-defined input parameters requiring significantly less amount time to obtain so that optimum bitumen content could be quickly determined. This will significantly reduce the amount of time and other resources required to determine optimum bitumen content.

The controller leverages a Quantum -inspired Fuzzy Rules Emulated Network (QFREN), allowing for the omission of input-output scaling and the design of membership functions based on practical operating ranges. By harnessing the power of quantum computation, it thoroughly analyzes closed -loop performance without relying on restrictive conditions. Experimental validation using a nonlinear passive circuit illustrates the controller's proficiency in emulating nonlinearities. The efficacy of the proposed controller is further affirmed through comprehensive assessments, including tracking performance, convergence of adjustable parameters, and compensation of nonlinearities.																			0016-0032	1879-2693				MAR	2024	361	4							106662	10.1016/j.jfranklin.2024.106662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfranklin.2024.106662		FEB 2024											WOS:001177713100001

This system senses vibrations in the fingertip that are produced by interactions of the finger with a touched object. It processes the vibration signals in real-time via a parametric signal network and returns them to the finger as "Tactile Echoes" of the touch interaction. Just as acoustic echoes continuously respond to sound, Tactile Echoes are continuously generated in response to the sensed tactile contacts. A short finger tap produces discrete Echoes, while a slide can yield continuous feedback. We also render the signals as sound, yielding multisensory feedback. Many different effects can be designed using ten signal processing parameters. Distinct effects may be assigned to different touched objects or surface regions by sensing the hand location in a mapped environment. We investigated how Tactile Echoes are perceived in a behavioral study using semantic differential scaling and multidimensional scaling methods. This yielded low-dimensional, semantically grounded representations of the perceptual similarities between different Echoes. This system holds promise for enabling evocative haptic effects during a wide range of free-hand tactile interactions.

A Lagrangean decomposition approach for oil supply chain investment planning under uncertainty with risk considerations	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												We present a scenario decomposition framework based on Lagrangean decomposition for the multi-product, multi-period, supply investment planning problem considering network design and discrete capacity expansion under demand uncertainty. We also consider a risk measure that allows to reduce the probability of incurring in high costs while preserving the decomposable structure of the problem. To solve the resulting large-scale two-stage mixed-integer stochastic linear programming problem we propose a novel Lagrangean decomposition scheme, and compare different formulations for the non-anticipativity conditions. In addition, we present a new hybrid algorithm for updating the Lagrangean multiplier set based on the combination of cutting-plane, subgradient and trust-region strategies. Numerical results suggest that different formulations of the non-anticipativity conditions have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm.

Normal cement concrete has shortcomings, e.g., high brittleness and low flexural-tensile strength, that fail to meet the requirements of construction repair. In this paper, a novel waterborne epoxy-concrete composite repair material (WECM) was prepared by using self-synthesized water-based epoxy resin based on the molecular structure-activity relationship. The mechanisms of waterborne epoxy (WEP) and WEP-fiber synergy on the improvement of concrete performance were clarified. The results show that the defects of high brittleness and poor ductility of concrete are significantly improved by WEP and that the ductility of WECM is increased by 300%-600% compared with the control concrete. The fiber and WEP in the WECM exhibited a synergistic effect on the tensile strength, ductility, and crack resistance of concrete in which the fiber coating layer mixed with WEP and embedded cement particles (inlay) provided fiber protection as well as an interfacial bonding enhancement. The P/C of 0.2 is the turning point of the flexural and tensile strength of the WECM, which is related to the continuous phase formation of the WEP-interpenetrating polymer network (WEP-IPN).

The key idea is to make use of not only the current and previous measurements, but also previous inputs for the reconstruction of the state variables. Using this idea, sliding mode controllers are designed for systems with constant or time-varying network delay. The approach is not only more practical but also easy to implement.

Quantization of both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator are taken into account for the networked systems, and the distributed time delay is also considered in the network channel.

In the meantime, vehicular environment radio propagation is negatively influenced by a large set of objects that cause transmission distortion such as high buildings. Therefore, this work is devoted to explore the area of RIS technology integration with vehicular communications while considering the dynamic nature of such communication environment. Specifically, we provide a system model where RoadSide Unit (RSU) leverages RIS to provide indirect wireless transmissions to disconnected areas, known as dark zones. Dark zones are spots within RSU coverage where the communication links are blocked due to the existence of blockages. In details, a discrete RIS is utilized to provide communication links between the RSU and the vehicles passing through out-of-service zones. Therefore, the joint problem of RSU resource scheduling and RIS passive beamforming or phase-shift matrix is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the minimum average bit rate. The formulated problem is mixed integer non-convex program which is difficult to be solved and does not account for the uncertain dynamic environment in vehicular networks. Thereby, we resort to alternative methods based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to determine RSU wireless scheduling and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) to solve for the phase-shift matrix, i.e., passive beamforming, of the RIS. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined and the complexity of the solution approach is discussed. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over baseline techniques.

In this article, we consider the UAV-assisted M-IoT network where USVs offload computation-intensive maritime tasks via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the UAV equipped with the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server subject to the UAV mobility. To improve the energy efficiency of offloading transmission and workload computation, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the USVs' offloaded workload, transmit power, computation resource allocation, as well as the UAV trajectory subject to the USVs' latency requirements. Despite the nature of mixed discrete and non-convex programming of the formulated problem, we exploit the vertical decomposition and propose a two-layered algorithm for solving it efficiently. Specifically, the top-layered algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of optimizing the UAV trajectory based on the idea of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and the underlying algorithm is proposed to optimize the underlying multidomain resource allocation problem based on the idea of the Lagrangian multiplier method. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as the performance advantage of NOMA-enabled computation offloading in terms of overall energy consumption.					qian, li/HZI-1596-2023; Lin, Bin/C-5933-2011; Zhang, Hongsen/P-8770-2018	Zhang, Hongsen/0000-0002-9733-0836; Wang, Qian/0000-0001-5544-4512													2327-4662					JAN 1	2023	10	1					539	552		10.1109/JIOT.2022.3201017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2022.3201017													WOS:000911309300040

Robust H<sub>∞</sub> Filtering for a Class of Two-Dimensional Uncertain Fuzzy Systems With Randomly Occurring Mixed Delays	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS												This paper is concerned with the robust H-infinity filtering problem for a class of 2-D uncertain fuzzy systems with randomly occurring mixed delays (ROMDs). The underlying 2-D systems are described by the Fornasini-Marchesini model, and the uncertainty is expressed in a linear fraction form. An improved Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model corresponding to the spatial promise variables is adopted to represent the complicated 2-D nonlinear system. The mixed delays consisting of both discrete and distributed delays are allowed to appear in a random manner governed by two sets of Bernoulli distributed white sequences with known probability. A full-order fuzzy filter is constructed to estimate the output signal such that, in the presence of parameter uncertainties and ROMDs, the dynamics of the estimation errors is asymptotically stable with a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. Based on the stochastic analysis technique and the Lyapunov-like functional, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the existence of the desired filters, and the explicit expressions of such filters are derived by means of the solution to a class of convex optimization problems that can be solved via standard software packages. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed filter design algorithms, and the filter performances with and without fuzzy rules are also compared.

The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), which allows unpredictable and predictable NOGO events to be contrasted, was imaged using a mixed (block and event-related) fMRI design to examine tonic and phasic processes involved in response inhibition, error detection, conflict monitoring and sustained attention. A network of regions, including right ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC), left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and right inferior parietal cortex, was activated for successful unpredictable inhibitions, while rostral anterior cingulate was implicated in error processing and the preSMA in conflict monitoring. Furthermore, the pattern of correlations between left dorsolateral PFC, implicated in task-set maintenance, and the pre-SMA were indicative of a tight coupling between prefrontally mediated control and conflict levels monitored more posteriorly. The results reveal that the executive control of behavior can be separated into distinct functions performed by discrete cortical regions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mizera, A; Czeizler, E; Petre, I				Mizera, Andrzej; Czeizler, Elena; Petre, Ion			Methods for Biochemical Model Decomposition and Quantitative Submodel Comparison	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Comparing alternative models for a given biochemical system is in general a very difficult problem: the models may focus on different aspects of the same system and may consist of very different species and reactions. The numerical setups of the models also play a crucial role in the quantitative comparison. When the alternative designs are submodels of a reference model, for example, knockdown mutants of a model, the problem of comparing them becomes simpler: they all have very similar, although not identical, underlying reaction networks, and the biological constraints are given by those in the reference model. In the first part of our study, we review several known methods for model decomposition and for quantitative comparison of submodels. We describe knockdown mutants, elementary flux modes, control-based decomposition, mathematically controlled comparison and its extension, local submodel comparison and a discrete approach for comparing continuous submodels. In the second part of the paper we present a new statistical method for comparing submodels, which complements the methods presented in the review. The main difference between our approach and the known methods is related to the important question of how to chose the numerical setup in which to perform the comparison. In the case of the reviewed methods, the comparison is made in the numerical context of the reference model, i.e., in each of the alternative models both the kinetics of the reactions and the initial values of all variables are chosen to be identical to those from the reference model. We propose in this paper a different approach, better suited for response networks, where each alternative model is assumed to start from its own steady state under basal conditions. We demonstrate our approach with a case study focusing on the heat shock response in eukaryotes.

J	Demir, E				Demir, Emre			Weiszfeld, tree-seed, and whale optimization algorithms comparison via locating transportation facilities with weightings considering the vulnerability and uncertainty	PLOS ONE												Searching for an optimum transportation facility location with emergency equipment and staff is essential for a specific region or a country. In this direction, this study addresses the following problems. First, the performances of the Weiszfeld, tree-seed, and whale optimization algorithms are compared, which is the first of its kind in the literature. Second, a new approach that tests the importance parameters' effectiveness in searching for an optimum transportation facility location with emergency equipment and staff is proposed. The Weiszfeld algorithm finds viable solutions with compact data, but it may not handle big data. In contrast, the flexibility of the tree-seed and whale optimization algorithm is literally an advantage when the number of parameters and variables increases. Therefore, there is a notable need to directly compare those algorithms' performances. If we do, the significance of extending the number of parameters with multiple weightings is appraised. According to the results, the Weiszfeld algorithm can be an almost flexible technique in continuous networks; however, it has reasonable drawbacks with discrete networks, while the tree-seed and whale optimization algorithms fit such conditions. On the other hand, these three methods do not show a fluctuating performance compared to one another based on the locating transportation facilities, and thus they deliver similar performance. Besides, although the value of accuracy is high with the application of the conventional technique Weiszfeld algorithm, it does not provide a significant performance accuracy advantage over the meta-heuristic methods.

The prevalence of mobile devices has made it possible to collect user trajectory and account for user movement while deploying relays. Under this background, a novel problem trajectory-based relay deployment (TBRD) is put forward. This problem considers communication-related metrics and is aimed at maximizing user connection time as users roam through the target area under relay resource constraints, which is more reasonable than the goal of expanding the relay coverage. To figure out the TBRD, we first propose the concept demand nodes (DNs), which are virtual weighted nodes representing the locations where users frequently pass or stay for a long period. Next, we design a Demand Node Generation algorithm that can transform the continuous historical user trajectory into a number of discrete DNs. By generating DNs, we convert the TBRD problem into a demand node coverage (DNC) problem, which is proved to be NP-complete. Followed by that, we introduce an approximation algorithm, named Submodular Iterative Deployment Algorithm, which solves the DNC problem with the approximation factor 1 - 1/root e.(1-1/k), where e is the mathematical constant, and k is the relay number constraint. Finally, five real trajectory datasets are used to evaluate our proposed algorithm, and the simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can obtain high coverage for users in motion, which can lead to better user experience. In addition, we also analyze the impact of different parameters on the coverage performance, and under this circumstance, we may safely come to the conclusion that our work is at the leading edge to utilize user trajectories for relay deployment in wireless networks.																			0010-4620	1460-2067				DEC	2022	65	12					3106	3122		10.1093/comjnl/bxab130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxab130		SEP 2021											WOS:000756690600001

For District Heating Networks, the upfront investment is a crucial factor for the rollout of this technology. Today, the pipe routing is usually designed relying on a linearization of the underlying heat transport problem. This study proposes to solve the optimal pipe routing problem as a non-linear topology optimization problem, drawing inspiration from density-based topology optimization. The optimization problem is formulated around a non-linear heat transport model and minimizes a detailed net present value representation of the heating network cost. By relaxing the combinatorial problem of pipe placement, this approach remains scalable for large-scale applications. In a design study on a realistic medium-sized network with 160 houses, a strong influence of economic parameters on the optimal network topology was observed. For this case, the optimization algorithm converges to a discrete network topology and near-discrete pipe design in about 10 min by using the proposed intermediate pipe penalization strategy. The optimal discrete network design found by the algorithm showed to outperform simple rounding post-processing steps by up to 2.8% of their respective net present value.

The present study is designed to investigate the role of hybrid filler in the electrochemical properties of the mixed matrix membrane. For this purpose, aluminum and gallium hybrids with indole and its derivatives were synthesized using the post-modification method. Then, synthesized hybrids were dispersed evenly into the polysulfone matrix and developed its membrane using the immersion precipitation phase inversion method. The FTIR result of aluminum and gallium hybrids identified the absorption bands of -C=C (1485-1400 cm(-1)), -CN (1340-1122 cm(-1)), and -NH (1625-1535 cm(-1)) with repeating units of Al-O (1178 cm(-1)) and Ga-O (1132-1117 cm(-1)). SEM images showed the spherical-shaped aluminum oxide and rod-shaped gallium oxide. XRD pattern corresponded to the cubic and trigonal crystal system of aluminum and gallium oxides. Electrochemical impedance study showed significant improvement in the electrical behavior of aluminum and gallium mixed matrix membranes where aluminum and gallium hybrids as a filler create the continuous network for the easy transportation of the charge carriers. The existence of the peaks at a similar position in both impedance and modulus formalisms suggests relaxations of the same type of charge species at the same type of electroactive region and disclose the real picture of the material.

Furthermore, to support the proposed model, we present a 4-dimensional learning activity task (4DLAT) framework which has helped us to structure our research into several phases where we can scale up from single-learner-discrete-task to group-learner sequenced-task, based on the proposed scenario.

J	Kell, DB; Samanta, S; Swainston, N				Kell, Douglas B.; Samanta, Soumitra; Swainston, Neil			Deep learning and generative methods in cheminformatics and chemical biology: navigating small molecule space intelligently	BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												The number of 'small' molecules that may be of interest to chemical biologists - chemical space - is enormous, but the fraction that have ever been made is tiny. Most strategies are discriminative, i.e. have involved 'forward' problems (have molecule, establish properties). However, we normally wish to solve the much harder generative or inverse problem (describe desired properties, find molecule). 'Deep' (machine) learning based on large-scale neural networks underpins technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing, driverless cars, and world-leading performance in games such as Go; it can also be applied to the solution of inverse problems in chemical biology. In particular, recent developments in deep learning admit the in silico generation of candidate molecular structures and the prediction of their properties, thereby allowing one to navigate (bio) chemical space intelligently. These methods are revolutionary but require an understanding of both (bio)chemistry and computer science to be exploited to best advantage. We give a high-level (non-mathematical) background to the deep learning revolution, and set out the crucial issue for chemical biology and informatics as a two-way mapping from the discrete nature of individual molecules to the continuous but high-dimensional latent representation that may best reflect chemical space. A variety of architectures can do this; we focus on a particular type known as variational autoencoders. We then provide some examples of recent successes of these kinds of approach, and a look towards the future.

J	Pal, A				Pal, Anirban			Fast and accurate computation of interactions between linear fiber segments	ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS												Purpose Fiber networks represent a vast class of materials, which can be modeled by representing its microstructure using one-dimensional fiber embedded in three-dimensional space. Investigating the statics, dynamics and thermodynamics of such structures from computational first principles requires the efficient estimation of cohesive-repulsive energies and forces between interacting fiber segments. This study offers a fast, efficient and effective computational methodology to estimate such interactions which can be coupled with Hamiltonian mechanics to simulate the behavior of fibrous systems. Design/methodology/approach This method preserves the uniformly continuous distribution of particles on the line segments and utilizes adaptive numerical integration of relevant distance-distribution functions to estimate the effective interaction energy and forces. Findings This method is found to be cheaper to compute and more accurate than the corresponding discrete scheme. This scheme is also versatile in the sense that any pair-wise interaction model can be used. Research limitations/implications The scheme depends on the availability of a suitable pair-interaction potential, such as a Lennard-Jones potential or Morse potential. Additionally, it can only be used for systems which are purely fibrous in nature. For example, fiber composites with a non-fibrous matrix are not addressed. Practical implications Paper, woven and hair can be represented as purely fibrous at some relevant length scales and are thus excellent candidate systems for this scheme. Originality/value This paper presents a novel method which allows rapid and accurate implementation of an otherwise computationally expensive process.

However, for the online scenario, traditional methods (e.g., game theory and numerical methods) cannot adapt to dynamic environments. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to adjust the policy to get long-term rewards. Nevertheless, since the joint problem of TO and RA is nonconvex and NP-hard, existing DRL methods cannot guarantee high efficiency because of the large action space. To solve the above problem, we propose a fast learning with integrated reward and reduced action space-based DRL framework (FLIRRAS), which adopts a low-complexity approach to jointly optimize TO and RA strategies. The FLIRRAS framework combines DRL with numerical methods to iteratively pursues the discrete TO and continuous RA. Specifically, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to learn environmental information, which can get prior knowledge of the offloading decision. Furthermore, a novel reward integrating the utility of TO and RA is designed to motivate the agent to find the optimal policy. To solve the dilemma that the action space is too large, low-complexity convex optimization methods, i.e., subgradient projection and KKT condition, are used to supplement and adjust the decision, which reduces the network parameters and the decision space. In addition, given the dynamic online environment, we introduce the experience replay mechanism, where policy is updated regularly to reflect the best mapping between states. The experiment results show that the performance of FLIRRAS is better than greedy and other DRL approaches, and it outperforms the latest DRL method by over 18.0% in terms of execution time.

Venkata Raghava			An IOT based Novel approach to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) using Optimized Bayesian Networks	JOURNAL OF MECHANICS OF CONTINUA AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES												As the size of the air quality data increases, it is difficult to forecast the air quality metrics due to the non-stationary and randomization form of data distribution. Air quality prediction refers to the problem of finding the air quality by using statistical inference measures. However, traditional air prediction models are based on static fixed parameters for quality prediction. Also, it is difficult to classify and predict the air quality index for both rural and urban areas due to change in data drift and distribution. PM2.5 is one of the major factor to predict the air quality index (AQI) and its severity level. Due to high noisy and outliers in the PM2.5 data, it is difficult to classify and predict the air quality by using the traditional quality prediction models. In order to overcome these issues, an optimized Bayesian networks based probabilistic inference model is designed and implemented on the air quality data. An IOT enabled Air pollution monitoring system includes a DSM501A Dust sensor which detects PM2.5, PM1.0, MQ series sensor interfaced to a Node MCU equipped with ESP32 WLAN adaptor to send the sensor reading to Thing Speak cloud. In the proposed model, the data is initially gathered from the ICAO records of Safdarjung weather station and pre-processed. An improved discrete and continuous parameter estimation and bayes score optimization are implemented on the air quality prediction process. Experimental results show that the present optimized Bayesian network classify and predicts the air quality data with high less computational error rate and high accuracy. Further the proposed optimized model is applied on the real data which is gathered using IOT enabled gas sensors and the model is giving best results in predicting the air quality Index.					raghavarao, yvenkata/AAQ-7803-2021; CHAITANYA, ATMAKURI/AAT-4848-2021; raghava, yvenkata/AAE-5743-2022	raghavarao, yvenkata/0000-0003-1134-4282; 													2454-7190	0973-8975				APR	2019	14	2					482	497		10.26782/jmcms.2019.04.000035	http://dx.doi.org/10.26782/jmcms.2019.04.000035													WOS:000495090100035

We assume that the firms place a given number of facilities on locations taken from a discrete set of possible points. For this bi-level optimization problem we consider six different customer behavior scenarios from the literature: binary, proportional and partially binary, each combined with essential and unessential demand. The decision making for the leader and the follower depends on these scenarios. In this work we present mixed integer linear programming models for the follower problem of each scenario and use them in combination with an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the location selection for the leader. A complete solution archive is used to detect already visited candidate solutions and convert them efficiently into similar, not yet considered ones. We present numerical results of our algorithm and compare them to so far state-of-the-art approaches from the literature. Our method shows good performance in all customer behavior scenarios and is able to outperform previous solution procedures on many occasions.					, CH/AAT-2453-2021; Biesinger, Benjamin/AAG-7148-2020; Raidl, Günther/JDC-4107-2023; Hu, Bin/ACD-0145-2022	Biesinger, Benjamin/0000-0001-6276-8339; Raidl, Günther/0000-0002-3293-177X; Hu, Bin/0000-0003-3514-5413													1012-2443	1573-7470				FEB	2016	76	1-2					93	119		10.1007/s10472-014-9448-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10472-014-9448-0													WOS:000374449200007

Our method improves the performance of MEMS inertial navigation positioning accuracy. In this paper, the GNSS discrete value is converted into a continuous value, the angular velocity and acceleration at any time are obtained by derivation. An algorithm based on the B-spline point acceleration and angular velocity criterion is designed to calculate the time delay between GNSS and MEMS IMU. In this paper, B-spline is used to convert the position information of GNSS into angular velocity and acceleration information. This greatly simplifies the model, while also suppressing inertial navigation errors. Finally, a method of varying learning rates is proposed to reduce training time. We compared other methods, the vehicle experiments show that the average positioning accuracy of pure IMU algorithm is 140.3m (RMSE) when GNSS is lost for one minute and the average travel distance is 729m, the average positioning accuracy of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is 65.34m, the average positioning accuracy of MLP algorithm is 58m, The average positioning accuracy of our method is 3.02m. High precision positioning in a short time is realized and the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified, the accuracy of our method is the state-of-the-art.

Predicting Compressive Strength of Concrete Using Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting Approach for Rapid Design of Mixtures	CIVIL ENGINEERING INFRASTRUCTURES JOURNAL-CEIJ												Applications of machine learning techniques in concrete properties' prediction have great interest to many researchers worldwide. Indeed, some of the most common machine learning methods are those based on adopting boosting algorithms. A new approach, histogram-based gradient boosting, was recently introduced to the literature. It is a technique that buckets continuous feature values into discrete bins to speed up the computations and reduce memory usage. Previous studies have discussed its efficiency in various scientific disciplines to save computational time and memory. However, the algorithm's accuracy is still unclear, and its application in concrete properties estimation has not yet been considered. This paper is devoted to evaluating the capability of histogram-based gradient boosting in predicting concrete's compressive strength and comparing its accuracy to other boosting methods. Generally, the results of the study have shown that the histogram-based gradient boosting approach is capable of achieving reliable prediction of concrete compressive strength. Additionally, it showed the effects of each model's parameters on the accuracy of the estimation.

J	Kogan, K; Khmelnitsky, E; Ibaraki, T				Kogan, K; Khmelnitsky, E; Ibaraki, T			Dynamic generalized assignment problems with stochastic demands and multiple agent-task relationships	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION												The assignment problem is a well-known operations research model. Its various extensions have been applied to the design of distributed computer systems, job assignment in telecommunication networks, and solving diverse location, truck routing and job shop scheduling problems. This paper focuses on a dynamic generalization of the assignment problem where each task consists of a number of units to be performed by an agent or by a limited number of agents at a time. Demands for the task units are stochastic. Costs are incurred when an agent performs a task or a group of tasks and when there is a surplus or shortage of the task units with respect to their demands. We prove that this stochastic, continuous-time generalized assignment problem is strongly NP-hard, and reduce it to a number of classical, deterministic assignment problems stated at discrete time points. On this basis, a pseudo-polynomial time combinatorial algorithm is derived to approximate the solution, which converges to the global optimum as the distance between the consecutive time points decreases. Lower bound and complexity estimates for solving the problem and its special cases are found.

By addressing the issue in many conventional control methods of multi-agent systems (MASs) where all available neighbor signals are used without evaluating the quality of the information, efforts of this paper seek to improve the overall tracking performance by actively selecting neighbor feedback signals in the robust non-singular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) control. A fast neighbor selection scheme is presented by incorporating an online noise covariance estimation into a nonlinear continuous-discrete unscented Kalman filter (CD-UKF). A selection index vector is recursively updated by the estimated noise covariance matrix for the control design. Simulation results of a group of six degrees of freedom (with three actuated joints) Phantom Omni models demonstrate the effectiveness of the online neighbor selection approach and compare it to previous work which does not actively select neighbor candidates.

Pearling: Stroke segmentation with crusted pearl strings	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IMAGE MINING THEORY AND APPLICATIONS					1st International Workshop on Image Mining Theory and Applications	JAN, 2008	Funchal, PORTUGAL					We introduce a novel segmentation technique, called Pearling, for the semi-automatic extraction of idealized models of networks of strokes (variable width curves) in images. These networks may for example represent roads in an aerial photograph, vessels in a medical scan, or strokes in a drawing. The operator seeds the process by selecting representative areas of good (stroke interior) and bad colors. Then, the operator may either provide a rough trace through a particular path in the stroke graph or simply pick a starting point (seed) on a stroke and a direction of growth. Pearling computes in realtime the centerlines of the strokes, the bifurcations, and the thickness function along each stroke, hence producing a purified medial axis transform of a desired portion of the stroke graph. No prior segmentation or thresholding is required. Simple gestures may be used to trim or extend the selection or to add branches. The realtime performance and reliability of Pearling results from a novel disk-sampling approach, which traces the strokes by optimizing the positions and radii of a discrete series of disks (pearls) along the stroke. A continuous model is defined through subdivision. By design, the idealized pearl string model is slightly wider than necessary to ensure that it contains the stroke boundary. A narrower core model that fits inside the stroke is computed simultaneously. The difference between the pearl string and its core contains the boundary of the stroke and may be used to capture, compress, visualize, or analyze the raw image data along the stroke boundary.

To implement wireless information and power transmission simultaneously, a time-switching protocol is adopted. In addition, two energy harvesting (EH) protocols are proposed. In the bidirectional continuous-time EH (BI-CT) protocol, the whole transmission block is divided into two parts: EH and information transmission. In the bidirectional discrete-time EH (BI-DT) protocol, the EH time is either 0 or 1. The relay first harvests energy and then forwards information from the user node to the source node. Notably, the relay node stores energy during poor channel conditions, increasing the energy efficiency. Theoretical analyses on the performance of the two proposed protocols are given. It is found that the throughput efficiency depends on various system parameters, such as the transfer power at the relay, distance between the nodes, noise power, and SNR detection threshold. Furthermore, it is observed that BI-DT outperforms BI-CT when the noise power at the relay is high or the distance between the source and the relay is large.

J	Wu, HG; Li, SC				Wu, Huaiguang; Li, Shuaichao			MixER: linear interpolation of latent space for entity resolution	COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS												Entity resolution, accurately identifying various representations of the same real-world entities, is a crucial part of data integration systems. While existing learning-based models can achieve good performance, the models are extremely dependent on the quantity and quality of training data. In this paper, the MixER model is proposed to alleviate these problems. The MixER utilizes our newly designed data augmentation method called EMix. The EMix can map discrete entity records to continuous latent space variables (e.g., probability distributions) and then linearly interpolate entity records in latent space to generate many augmented training samples. The matching model is further optimized based on the augmented data to strengthen its generalization capability. The MixER model achieves significant strengths in the data sensitivity experiments when training data is below 50. In robustness experiments, the MixER model presents an absolute performance advantage when the label noise exceeds 20%. In addition, ablation experiments demonstrate that the newly developed EMix can effectively improve the generalization ability of the matching model. The overall experimental results prove that the MixER model exhibited excellent data sensitivity and robustness over the current state-of-the-art methods.																			2199-4536	2198-6053				FEB	2024	10	1					3	22		10.1007/s40747-023-01018-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40747-023-01018-2		MAR 2023											WOS:000949729700001
J	Fan, QY; Yang, GH				Fan, Quan-Yong; Yang, Guang-Hong			Sampled-data output feedback control based on a new event-triggered control scheme	INFORMATION SCIENCES												In this paper, a new event-triggered control (ETC) scheme is proposed to investigate the observer-based output feedback control problems. To reduce the usage of communication resources, the control input is designed as a specific time-varying signal between two consecutive event-triggering instants, which is different from the general ETC methods. For the continuous-time event detection case, it is shown that the obtained lower bound of the minimum inter-event interval is not smaller than the one using the existing method. In addition, a novel discrete-time event detection scheme and the corresponding ETC policy based on the sampling output is proposed. Employing the stability analysis method for the time-delay system, a sufficient condition on the existence of an observer-based controller is presented. Finally, the simulation results are given to show that the proposed ETC scheme is beneficial to further reduce the frequency of the communication between sensors and the control unit.

In minerals engineering numerous opportunities for the application of these systems exist, such as the characterization of flotation froth structures which is discussed in this paper by way of example. A general model for the development of feasible, real-time machine vision systems is proposed, which is based on an analogy with biological visual perception made possibly by a connectionist approach and the ability of neural networks to solve ill-posed problems. It is shown that both supervised and unsupervised neural nets can be used in different ways to analyze froth structures of industrial flotation cells. Unsupervised (self-organizing) neural nets can monitor process behaviors on a continuous rather than on a discrete basis, which makes the early detection of erratic process control possible. Since some losses in information are incurred with the use of self-organizing systems, intelligent monitoring and control systems would in practice probably be comprised of both types of neural nets.																			0892-6875					JAN-FEB	1995	8	1-2					23	30		10.1016/0892-6875(94)00099-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0892-6875(94)00099-X													WOS:A1995QE61300003

Because the particle swarm is highly sensitive to its parameters and boundary conditions, the available restricted boundary conditions are applied. Also, a new boundary condition called the billiard boundary condition is introduced, which does not depend on the velocity clamping that mainly depends on human assumptions. The performance of the boundary conditions are tested under different populations, and a new initialization method by setting the initial position to one side of boundary solutions that is set to the maximum available diameter. The Newton-Raphson method is used as the hydraulic solver. The technique is applied to the optimal design of both the two-loop water distribution network, which is a well-known benchmark in the literature, and to a large-scale previously investigated two-source pipe network. The results show that the application of the integer discrete particle swarm algorithm with the proposed billiard boundary condition and initialization method in the least-cost design of water distribution networks is more effective when compared to others in reducing the pipe cost and the function evaluation number.

This fatigue affects the performance of workers in jobs that involve some continuous physical activity, and is the cause of a large proportion of accidents at work. The physical fatigue is commonly measured by the perceived exertion (RPE). Many previous studies have attempted to continuously monitor workers in order to detect the level of fatigue and prevent these accidents, but most have used invasive sensors that are difficult to place and prevent the worker from performing their tasks correctly. Other works use activity measurement sensors such as accelerometers, but the large amount of information obtained is difficult to analyse in order to extract the characteristics of each fatigue state. In this work, we use a dataset that contains data from inertial sensors of several workers performing various activities during their working day, labelled every 10 min based on their level of fatigue using questionnaires and the Borg fatigue scale. Applying Machine Learning techniques, we design, develop and test a system based on a neural network capable of classifying the variation of fatigue caused by the physical activity collected every 10 min; for this purpose, a feature extraction is performed after the time decomposition done with the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The results show that the proposed system has an accuracy higher than 92% for all the cases, being viable for its application in the proposed scenario.

J	Cotterell, J; Sharpe, J				Cotterell, James; Sharpe, James			Mechanistic Explanations for Restricted Evolutionary Paths That Emerge from Gene Regulatory Networks	PLOS ONE												The extent and the nature of the constraints to evolutionary trajectories are central issues in biology. Constraints can be the result of systems dynamics causing a non-linear mapping between genotype and phenotype. How prevalent are these developmental constraints and what is their mechanistic basis? Although this has been extensively explored at the level of epistatic interactions between nucleotides within a gene, or amino acids within a protein, selection acts at the level of the whole organism, and therefore epistasis between disparate genes in the genome is expected due to their functional interactions within gene regulatory networks (GRNs) which are responsible for many aspects of organismal phenotype. Here we explore epistasis within GRNs capable of performing a common developmental function - converting a continuous morphogen input into discrete spatial domains. By exploring the full complement of GRN wiring designs that are able to perform this function, we analyzed all possible mutational routes between functional GRNs. Through this study we demonstrate that mechanistic constraints are common for GRNs that perform even a simple function. We demonstrate a common mechanistic cause for such a constraint involving complementation between counter-balanced gene-gene interactions. Furthermore we show how such constraints can be bypassed by means of "permissive" mutations that buffer changes in a direct route between two GRN topologies that would normally be unviable. We show that such bypasses are common and thus we suggest that unlike what was observed in protein sequence-function relationships, the "tape of life" is less reproducible when one considers higher levels of biological organization.

Fractional delay compensated discrete-time SMC for networked control system	DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS												Time-varying network induced delay in the communication channel severely affects the performance of closed loop network control systems. In this paper, a novel idea of compensating the fractional time varying communication delay in the sliding surface is presented. The fractional time delay in the sensor to controller and controller to actuator channel is approximated using the Thiran approximation technique to design the sliding surface. A discrete-time sliding mode control law is derived using the proposed surface that compensates fractional time delay in sensor to controller and controller to actuator channels for uncertain network control systems. The sufficient condition for closed loop stability of the system is derived using the Lyapunov function. The efficacy of the proposed strategy is supported by the simulation results.

The proposed circuits implement discrete-time continuous-state dynamics by means of analog processing in a time domain, Arbitrary nonlinear transformation functions can be generated by using the conversion from an analog voltage to a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) signal; for the transformation, time-domain nonlinear voltage waveforms having the same shape as the inverse function of the desired transformation function are used. The circuit simultaneously outputs both voltage and PWM signals following the desired dynamics. If the nonlinear voltage waveforms are generated by digital circuits and D/A converters with low-pass filters, high flexibility and controllability are obtained, Moreover, the nonlinear dynamics can be changed in realtime, Common waveform generators can be shared by many independent chaos generator circuits, Because the proposed circuits mainly consist of capacitors, switches, and CMOS logic gates, they are suitable for scaled VLSI implementation. CMOS circuits generating arbitrary chaos with up to third-order nonlinearity and two variables have been designed and fabricated using a 0.4 mum CMOS process. Chaos has been successfully generated by using tent, logistic, and Henon maps, and a chaotic neuron model.

J	Xia, M; Yang, SY; Sykulski, J				Xia, Meng; Yang, Shiyou; Sykulski, Jan			A Novel 3-D Topology Optimization Methodology Based on the Min-Cut Theorem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS												Topology optimization (TO) has become a new paradigm to provide a quantitative design methodology for modern devices. In the two categories, the discrete-variable-based one and the continuous-variable-based one, of the existing TO methodologies, the on/off method - a typical method of the former - outperforms the latter in terms of an intuitive representation of the optimized results. Moreover, the existing TO techniques or procedures are generally 2-D. To address the aforementioned issues of existing methodologies, a new 3-D TO method based on the min-cut theorem is proposed. Three types of element connectivity are defined and used to transform a 3-D mesh grid to a 2-D network, providing equivalent quantities to perform the 3-D TO under the same implementation as in 2-D with no additional cost. Furthermore, the mechanism of the parameter selection is explored to provide rules for parameter tuning in engineering applications. As demonstrated by the reported numerical results, the proposed methodology is characterized by straightforward policy of parameter tuning and can find the optimized checkerboard-free topology with significant performance improvements.

Advancements in optical sensors and image-processing algorithms increased the applicability of image-based noncontact techniques, such as photogrammetry, infrared thermography, and laser imaging for structural health monitoring (SHM). In addition, with the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, the assessment process is expedited and made more efficient. This article summarizes the efforts made in the last five years to leverage AI-aided noncontact sensing techniques for applications in SHM with an emphasis on image-based methods.

Conventional identification methodologies use continuous motion signals. However, these signals are quantized in their amplitude and are discrete in time. Therefore, the time required to identify the parameters of a robot with a limited measurement system is related to an optimized motion trajectory performed by the robot. The proposed methodology consists of an algorithm that uses a trained CNN with the data created by the dynamical model of the case study robot. A processing technique is proposed to transform the position, velocity, acceleration, and torque robot signals into an image whose characteristics are extracted by the CNN to determine their dynamic parameters. The proposed algorithm does not require any optimal trajectory to find the dynamic parameters. A proposed time-spectral evaluation metric is used to validate the robot data and the identification data. The validation results show that the proposed methodology identifies the parameters of a Cartesian robot in less than 1 second, exceeding 90% of the proposed evaluation metric and 98% for the simulation results.

Recent decades have witnessed the advance of weather observation and simulation technologies, triggering an explosion of meteorological data which are collected from multiple sources (e.g., radar, automatic stations and numerical weather prediction) and usually characterized by a spatiotemporal (ST) structure. As a result, the adequate exploition of these multi-source ST data emerges as a promising but challenging topic for weather forecasting. To address this issue, we propose a data-driven forecasting framework (referred to as LightNet+) based on deep neural networks using a lightning scenario. Our framework design enables LightNet+ to make forecasts by mining complementary information distributed across multiple data sources, which may be heterogeneous in spatial (continuous versus discrete) and temporal (observations from the past versus simulation of the future) domains. We evaluate LightNet+ using a real-world weather dataset in North China. The experimental results demonstrate: (a) LightNet+ produces significantly better forecasts than three established lightning schemes, and (b) the more data sources are fed into LightNet+, the higher forecasting quality it achieves.					zheng, liming/GWV-7646-2022; Li, Qingyong/GPK-0945-2022	zheng, liming/0000-0002-7939-2152; Li, Qingyong/0000-0002-3860-4809													0035-9009	1477-870X				OCT	2021	147	741					4048	4062		10.1002/qj.4167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.4167		OCT 2021											WOS:000705839900001

Existing approaches focus on modeling the order information of user's search history by sequential methods such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). However, these methods usually ignore the fine-grained time information associated with user actions. In fact, the time intervals between queries can help to capture the evolution of query intent and document interest of users. Besides, the time intervals between past actions and current query can reflect the re-finding tendency more accurately than discrete steps in RNN. In this paper, we propose PSTIE, a fine-grained Time Information Enhanced model to construct more accurate user interest representations for Personalized Search. To capture the short-term interest of users, we design time-aware LSTM architectures for modeling the subtle interest evolution of users in continuous time. We further leverage time in calculating the re-finding possibility of users to capture the long-term user interest. We propose two methods to utilize the time-enhanced user interest into personalized ranking. Experiments on two datasets show that PSTIE can effectively improve the ranking quality over state-of-the-art models.

Discrete-time distributed state measurements (called process snapshots) are used by a continuous-time regulator to stabilize the process. The main objective of this article is to identify a criterion to minimize the communication bandwidth between sensors and controller (snapshots acquisition frequency) using linear systems analysis and still achieve closed-loop stability. This objective is addressed by adding a modeling layer to the regulator. Theoretically, DPSs can be well described by low dimensional ordinary differential equation models when represented in functional spaces; practically, the model accuracy hinges on finding basis functions for these spaces. Adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition is used to identify statistically important basis functions and establish locally accurate reduced order models which are then used in controller design. The proposed approach is successfully applied toward thermal regulation in a tubular chemical reactor.

State and output faults of bias type that may evolve slowly or abruptly are considered, and the delay system is disturbed by unstructured bounded unknown inputs. Based on the scheme of [Trunov, A. B., & Polycarpou, M. M. (2000). Automated fault diagnosis in nonlinear multivariable systems using a learning methodology. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 11, 91-101], a novel adaptive observer for detecting and estimating faults in the considered system is constructed, and robustness with respect to unknown inputs and sensitivity to faults of the detecting scheme are rigorously analyzed. The fault estimate and the state estimation error are then proved to be uniformly bounded. Finally, simulations of a heating process demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect the faults shortly after the occurrences without any false alarm and can approximate the faults with desired accuracy.

The techniques available for these descriptions are mostly continuous Geostatistical models, or discontinuous facies models such as the Boolean, Indicator or Gaussian-Threshold models and the Markov chain model. These facies models are better suited to treating issues of rock strata connectivity, e.g. buried high permeability channels or low permeability barriers, which greatly affect flow and, above all, transport in aquifers. Genetic models provide new ways to incorporate more geology into the facies description, an approach that has been well developed in the oil industry, but not enough in hydrogeology. The conclusion is that future work should be focused on improving the facies models, comparing them, and designing new in situ testing procedures (including geophysics) that would help identify the facies geometry and properties. A world-wide catalog of aquifer facies geometry and properties, which could combine site genesis and description with methods used to assess the system, would be of great value for practical applications.

Neural networks based ADP algorithms with empirical design of critic networks often suffer into the local minima in neural network training. To overcome the difficulty of designing model structure in parametric models and improve the generalization capability of ADP, a two-phase value iteration method for a Gaussian-kernel-based critic network is presented. It is able to update the hyper-parameter of the kernel function and the values of samples simultaneously. Combining this critic network design with actor network, the Gaussian-kernel-based adaptive dynamic programming (GK-ADP) approach for trace tracking is proposed. By simulation, the effectiveness of the GK-ADP for tracking control of discrete-time affine nonlinear systems is verified.					chen, xin/AFS-7186-2022														2161-2927		978-9-8815-6391-0				2016							3229	3234																WOS:000388809503123

This paper presents a deep color decomposition based framework for image recoloring, allowing users to achieve professional color edition through simple interactive operations. Different from existing methods that perform palette generation and color decomposition separately, our method directly generates the recolored images by a light-weight CNN. We first formulate the generation of color palette as an unsupervised clustering problem, and employ a fully point-wise CNN to extract the most representative colors from the input image. Particularly, a pixel scrambling strategy is adopted to map the continuous image color to a compact discrete palette space, facilitating the CNN focus on color-relevant features. Then, we devise a deep color decomposition network to obtain the projected weights of input image on the basis colors of the generated palette space, and leverage them for image recoloring in a user-interacted manner. In addition, a novel aesthetic constraint derived from color harmony theory is proposed to augment the color reconstruction from user-specified colors, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing visual effect. Qualitative comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.					lin, lin/KFB-9548-2024; Cao, Yang/HGD-6463-2022; Zha, Zheng-Jun/AAF-8667-2020; Zha, Zheng-Jun/AAE-8408-2020	Zha, Zheng-Jun/0000-0003-2510-8993													0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-030-37731-1; 978-3-030-37730-4				2020	11961						127	138		10.1007/978-3-030-37731-1_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37731-1_11													WOS:000611565300011

The parameters considered are the cost in terms of number of transponders and power utilization. We assume OTN based network with QPSK and 16QAM modulation schemes for the both. We observed that photonic integration based sliceable transponders (sliceable photonics) is much more advantageous than discrete transponder optics, both running with either QPSK or 16QAM modulation schemes. Finally, we compare the effect of modulation schemes on the efficiency of the network by comparing QPSK and 16QAM in discrete transponder optics and show that 16QAM in discrete transponder optics makes the network more inefficient.																			2329-7077		978-1-5090-0293-1				2015																								WOS:000375678600006

We empirically study the effect of word embeddings and character embeddings on the task by extending a CRF baseline using neural networks. Results show the proposed neural network model achieves competitive performance, outperforming the current best discrete model.

In the circuit implementation of memristive neural network, the synapses are modeled by memristors. Compared with common neural networks, memristive neural network can simulate the human brain better. The fixed-time controller designed in this paper is simplest among all the controllers that are used to study fixed-time stability/synchronization. Since fixed time stability, fixed-time synchronization and fixed-time anti-synchronization are all special cases of fixed-time projective synchronization, some existing results about the stability/synchronization of MNNs can be regarded as the corollaries of our theoretical results. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The morphological and structural characteristics of the transformed carbon material revealed a highly disordered graphitic carbon composed of a porous network with energy storage capability. The mixed-assembly type cells fabricated from the best samples based on specific capacitance from the single electrode tests exhibited electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) behaviour in all sample combinations using all the three transformed activated carbon materials. The mixed-assembly device worked comfortably in a voltage window of 1.5V in neutral aqueous electrolyte. A specific capacitance (C-s) of approximate to 110Fg(-1) was obtained with a corresponding energy density of 8.5Whkg(-1) and power density of 380Wkg(-1) at a current density of 0.5Ag(-1) for the PC_RH device An excellent stability was exhibited with a coulombic efficiency of a 99.7% and capacitance retention of 80% after 10,000 continuous cycling at 5.0Ag(-1). Furthermore, subjecting the PC_RH mixed device to a floating test for approximate to 48h (2days) at its optimum voltage (1.5V) revealed retention in the capacitance value to more than 50% its initial value with still no recorded device failure. Remarkably, the asymmetric design showed a potential for adopting EDLC materials of different carbon sources in order to capture the entire properties for efficient and stable energy storage devices.

To evaluate 13C-metabolic flux maps for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, an original experimental framework was designed allowing rapid, reliable collection of high-quality isotopomer data against time. It involved (i) a short-time 13C labeling injection device based on mixing control in a torus-shaped photobioreactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics allowing a sudden step-change in the 13C proportion in the substrate feed and (ii) a rapid sampling procedure using an automatic fast filtration method coupled to a manual rapid liquid nitrogen quenching step. 13C-substrate labeling enrichment was controlled through the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration in the pulsed solution. First results were obtained from steady-state continuous culture measurements allowing the characterization of the kinetics of label incorporation into light-limited growing cells cultivated in a photobioreactor operating at the maximal biomass productivity for an incident photon flux density of 200 mu molm-2s-1. 13C label incorporation was measured for 21 intracellular metabolites using IC-MS/MS in 58 samples collected across a labeling experiment duration of 7 min. The fastest labeling rate was observed for 2/3-phosphoglycerate with an apparent isotopic stationary state reached after 300s. The labeling rate was consistent with the optimized mixing time of about 4.9s inside the reactor and the shortest reliable sampling period assessed at 5s. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109: 30303040.

Eliminating Monitor Overuse (EMO) type III effectiveness-deimplementation cluster-randomized trial: Statistical analysis plan	CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS												Background: Deimplementing overused health interventions is essential to maximizing quality and value while minimizing harm, waste, and inefficiencies. Three national guidelines discourage continuous pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) monitoring in children who are not receiving supplemental oxygen, but the guideline-discordant practice remains prevalent, making it a prime target for deimplementation. This paper details the statistical analysis plan for the Eliminating Monitor Overuse (EMO) SpO(2) trial, which compares the effect of two competing deimplementation strategies (unlearning only vs. unlearning plus substitution) on the sustainment of deimplementation of SpO(2) monitoring in children with bronchiolitis who are in room air. Methods: The EMO Trial is a hybrid type 3 effectiveness-deimplementation trial with a longitudinal cluster randomized design, conducted in Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings Network hospitals. The primary outcome is deimplementation sustainment, analyzed as a longitudinal difference-in-differences comparison between study arms. This analysis will use generalized hierarchical mixed-effects models for longitudinal clustering outcomes. Secondary outcomes include the length of hospital stay and oxygen supplementation duration, modeled using linear mixed-effects regressions. Using the well-established counterfactual approach, we will also perform a mediation analysis of hospital-level mechanistic measures on the association between the deimplementation strategy and the sustainment outcome. Discussion: We anticipate that the EMO Trial will advance the science of deimplementation by providing new insights into the processes, mechanisms, and likelihood of sustained practice change using rigorously designed deimplementation strategies. This pre-specified statistical analysis plan will mitigate reporting bias and support data-driven approaches. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05132322. Registered on 24 November 2021.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) constitutes an option for systems whose mathematical description is uncertain or partially unknown. In this paper, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is designed to address the problems of identification and control of discrete-time nonlinear systems given by a gray box. The learning laws for the RNN are designed in terms of discrete-time Lyapunov stability. The control input is developed fulfilling the existence condition to establish a Quasi Sliding Regime. In means of Lyapunov stability, the identification and tracking errors are ultimately bounded in a neighborhood around zero. Numerical examples are presented to show the behavior of the RNN in the identification and control processes of a highly nonlinear discrete-time system, a Lorentz chaotic oscillator.

Based on the nature of the demands, it may be convenient to set up lightpaths with different bit rates. Then, the network design cost could be reduced because low-bit-rate services will need less grooming (i.e., less multiplexing with other low-bit-rate services onto high-capacity wavelengths) while high-bit-rate services can be accommodated on a wavelength itself. Future optical networks may support mixed line rates (say over 10/40/100 Gbps). Since a lightpath may travel a long distance, for high bit rates, the effect of the physical impairments along a lightpath may become very significant (leading to high bit-error rate (BER)); and the signal's maximum transmission range, which depends on the bit rate, will become limited. In this study, we propose a novel, cost-effective approach to design a mixed-line-rate (MLR) network with transmission-range (TR) constraint. By intelligent assignment of channel rates to lightpaths, based on their TR constraint, the need for signal regeneration can be minimized, and a "transparent" optical network can be designed to support all-optical end-to-end lightpaths. The design problem is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP). Our results show that, with mixed line rates and maximum transmission range constraints, one can design a cost-effective network.

The communication relationship among the edges of networked systems is modeled by well-known line graph.

C	Jagannathan, S			IEEE; IEEE	Jagannathan, S			Admission controller design for high-speed networks: A hybrid system approach	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2002 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1 & 2					IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	SEP 18-20, 2002	GLASGOW, SCOTLAND	IEEE Control Syst Soc, IEEE, CSS				A novel real-time discrete-event admission control (AC) scheme for high-speed networks is proposed with the aim of attaining a desired quality of service (QoS) and high network utilization. The AC encapsulates adaptive bandwidth estimation scheme, a congestion indicator, Peak bit/cell Rate (PBR/PCR) estimate from new sources. The admission controller dynamics are expressed as a discrete-event system while the bandwidth estimator is design-based on Lyapunov theory and the congestion controller dynamics are given in discrete-time. The novel aspect of the proposed approach is the application of hybrid system theory to prove the performance of the proposed admission controller, stability and the development of rigorous and repeatable design procedure. The performance of the proposed AC is evaluated using the QoS metrics, which are given in terms of service delay, packet/cell losses, and network utilization. Simulation results are presented by streaming ON/OFF and MPEG video data into the network. Results show that the proposed AC admits significantly more traffic compared to other available admission control schemes thereby guaranteeing high network utilization while maintaining the desired QoS.																					0-7803-7386-3				2002							542	547																WOS:000179485900095

The method is designed to enhance coherence of the signal statistical features across the array of sensors and consists of three steps: signal processing, space-time imaging, and detection and location. The first step provides, for each station, a simplified representation of seismic signal by extracting multiscale non-stationary statistical characteristics, through multiband higher-order statistics or envelopes. This signal processing scheme is designed to account for a priori unknown transients, potentially associated with a variety of sources (e.g. earthquakes, tremors), and to prepare data for a better performance in posterior steps. Following space-time imaging is carried through 3-D spatial mapping and summation of station-pair time-delay estimate functions. This step produces time-series of 3-D spatial images representing the likelihood that each pixel makes part of a source. Detection and location is performed in the final step by extracting the local maxima from the 3-D spatial images. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method in detecting and locating seismic sources associated with low signal-to-noise ratio on an example of the aftershock earthquake records from local stations of International Maule Aftershock Deployment in Central Chile. The performance and potential of the method to detect, locate and characterize the energy release associated with possibly mixed seismic radiation from earthquakes and low-frequency tectonic tremors is further tested on continuous data from southwestern Japan.

Vehicular Network Simulation Environment via Discrete Event System Modeling	IEEE ACCESS												A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) enables vehicles to communicate with each other directly or via roadside infrastructure in order to improve road safety and efficiency. Within a VANET, communications can potentially alter vehicular mobility and conversely, that the mobility could potentially influence vehicular communications. Therefore, a VANET simulator environment is needed that can accurately model interactions between vehicular mobility and network protocols. In this paper, we present a novel vehicular network simulation environment designed using the MATLAB discrete event system (DES) in the SimEvents toolbox. The proposed simulation environment is a bit-accurate, discrete event simulator that integrates vehicular mobility operations with wireless network communication. This paper provides details on the design of the proposed simulator. Its computational costs are evaluated in terms of events quantities and execution time. The physical (PHY) layer of the proposed simulator shows a more realistic packet success rate (PSR) using bit-level processing techniques when compared with the packet-based NS-3 simulator. The performance of the priority-based media access control (MAC) layer proves the data with different priorities that can coexist in the same channel.

Secondary objectives include minimising nutrient degradation and minimising annual costs. Common design practices for continuous sterilisation networks rely on simple heuristics which typically do not account for any suspended solids and do not guarantee cost optimality. In this paper, an optimal design procedure is formulated which guarantees sterility both in the liquid and solid phases, whilst avoiding excessive degradation of any labile nutrients present, and takes account of capital and operating costs.

This is an iteration process. A back-propagation neural network is trained to simulate the feasible domain formed by the implicit constraints. A search algorithm then searches for the "optimal point" in the feasible domain simulated by the neural network. This new design point is checked against the true constraints to see whether it is feasible, and is added to the training set. Then the neural network is trained again. With more design points in the training set, information about the whole search domain is accumulated to progressively form a better approximation for the feasible domain. This iteration process continues until the approximate model insists the same "optimal" point in consecutive iterations. In each iteration, only one evaluation of the implicit constraints is needed to see whether the current design point is feasible. No precise function value or sensitivity calculation is required. Several engineering design examples are used to demonstrate the practicality of this approach.																			1340-8062					MAR	2001	44	1					103	112		10.1299/jsmec.44.103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1299/jsmec.44.103													WOS:000168481300014
J	Galindo-Serrano, A; Giupponi, L				Galindo-Serrano, Ana; Giupponi, Lorenza			Self-organized femtocells: a Fuzzy Q-Learning approach	WIRELESS NETWORKS												We introduce in this paper the innovative concept of self-organized femtocells for future generation broadband cellular networks. Since the home is the basic unit at which femtocells will be located, their deployment will be massive and their number and position unknown to the operator. This requires femtocells to be autonomous and self-organized, and able to work without human intervention. We propose self-organization to be implemented through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and femtocells to make transmission decisions as a multiagent system, with the objective of maximizing the system capacity and not generating additional interference to the traditional macrocell network. In particular, we manage the femto-to-macro aggregated interference, in realistic wireless settings, by means of Q-Learning (QL) techniques, which allow the femtocells to learn online and distributively the most appropriate resource allocation policy by continuous interactions with the environment. However, QL is based on discrete representation of state and action spaces, which makes the proposed approach not independent of the environment and designer criterion, since it requires a significant human intervention in the definition of the state and action spaces. As a result, we propose to optimize the self-organization capabilities of the proposed scheme by combining QL with the Fuzzy Inference System theory. We then propose a Fuzzy Q-Learning approach which allows avoiding the subjectivity of the QL design with continuous state and action representation, besides improving performance and convergence capabilities. We evaluate simulation results in a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) compliant scenario and we compare them to heuristic approaches. Results will show the unique ability of these RL approaches to self-adapt to the dynamics of realistic wireless scenarios. Finally, we discuss the implementability of the proposed schemes in 3GPP systems, and in terms of memory and computational requirements.

Noise is generated due to simultaneous switching multiple drivers in the digital ICs. It is called as SSN. It could propagate between power and ground planes of underlying PCB platform and interfere with the functionality of nearby RF/Analog ICs. So, the RF modules are isolated from the digital module for proper functioning of entire mixed-signal system. A high-impedance surface, called T-shape EBG has been implemented between digital and RF modules. It will exhibit the characteristics of bandgap for a wide frequency range to suppress the propagation of switching noise. A single unit-cell of T-EBG is periodically patterned over one side of the PCB and the other side is kept continuous. In this paper different characteristics of T-EBG have been simulated and verified with the measurement results. A 3 x 3 T-EBG layout provides an isolation of 240 dB from 0.72 to 6.39 GHz. A scaled version of T-EBG is used to shift the bandgap towards higher frequency range from 2.22 to 7.19 GHz. Also, a novel layout methodology has been proposed to broaden the bandgap from 2.02 to 18.84 GHz without reducing the thickness of dielectric substrate.

Given a set of satellites, a set of available antennas and a time horizon, the problem consists of designing an operational plan that assigns satellites to antennas in an optimal fashion. Extending a previous integer linear programming (ILP) model (shortening model, with only integer variables), we propose a mixed ILP (MILP) (shaving model, which includes both continuous and integer variables), to more efficiently solve this problem. After computing the passes generated by the satellites' windows of visibility from the antennas, the optimal planner is able to cancel a pass, move it to another antenna, or shorten its duration, in order to avoid scheduling conflicts. In contrast to the shortening model, which used intersections between passes to determine the best schedule, the shortening operation is now referred to as shaving, since the shaving model can arbitrarily adjust the duration of a pass in a razor-like fashion, giving the model its name. Computational results obtained in tests over realistic scenarios prove that the shaving model outperforms the shortening model, producing fewer cancellations, smaller shaved times, and a fairer distribution of cancelled passes among satellites, with much shorter preprocessing times.

These components, including discrete and microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) inductors, have a wide range of applications in RF (radio frequency) transceivers, such as voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), low-noise amplifier (LNA), direct current-direct current (DC-DC) converters, matching networks, multi-band filters, multi-band RF circuits, RF power amplifiers in radio transmitters, high-isolated switches, and reconfigurable antennas. Abstract This paper reports on the novel implementation of a tunable solenoid inductor using the fluid-based inductance varying technique. The concept utilized material permeability variation that directly modifies self-induced magnetic flow density inside the coil, which in turn creates a variation of the inductance value. The core is formed by a channel which allows the circulation of a liquid through it. The liquid proposed for this technique has ferromagnetic behavior, called ferrofluid, with a magnetic permeability higher than unity. To evaluate the proposed technique, two different types of solenoid inductor were designed, simulated and measured. The two structures are wire-wound and wire bond solenoid inductors. The structures are simulated in a 3D EM analysis tool followed by fabrication, test and measurement. The wire-bonded-based inductor showed a quality factor of 12.7 at 310 MHz, with 81% tuning ratio, by using ferrofluid EMG 901. The wire-wound-based inductor showed that the maximum tuning ratio is 90.6% with quality factor 31.3 at 300 MHz for ferro fluidic EMG 901. The maximum measured tuning ranges were equal to 83.5% and 56.2% for the wire-wound type and the wire-bonded one, respectively. The measurement results for the proposed technique showed a very high tuning range, as well as high quality factor and continuous tunability.

Single network adaptive critic design for power system stabilisers	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION												The recently developed single network adaptive critic (SNAC) design has been used in this study to design a power system stabiliser (PSS) for enhancing the small-signal stability of power systems over a wide range of operating conditions. PSS design is formulated as a discrete non-linear quadratic regulator problem. SNAC is then used to solve the resulting discrete-time optimal control problem. SNAC uses only a single critic neural network instead of the action-critic dual network architecture of typical adaptive critic designs. SNAC eliminates the iterative training loops between the action and critic networks and greatly simplifies the training procedure. The performance of the proposed PSS has been tested on a single machine infinite bus test system for various system and loading conditions. The proposed stabiliser, which is relatively easier to synthesise, consistently outperformed stabilisers based on conventional lead-lag and linear quadratic regulator designs.																			1751-8687	1751-8695				SEP	2009	3	9					850	858		10.1049/iet-gtd.2009.0023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-gtd.2009.0023													WOS:000269620600006

The proposed model minimizes total transportation and installation costs of a mixed fleet dispatching system combining relay network and point-to-point dispatching. Operational constraints such as maximum driver tour length and load circuity are considered within the variable definition using predefined templates to generate feasible routes. High quality solutions for largely-sized problem instances are obtained in reasonable times. Computational results are analyzed to develop insights about the mixed fleet dispatching system and quantify its benefits over relay network-only and point-to-point dispatching.

A data shuffle network structure is presented in this work and we will show how it is used in conjunction with a partial column structure to build and compute the transforms. The scalability is based only on the transform size and the number of processing elements (PE). The transform throughput is determined by the number of PE and its associated shuffle network size.

J	Lark, RM				Lark, R. M.			Some considerations on aggregate sample supports for soil inventory and monitoring	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Soil monitoring and inventory require a sampling strategy. One component of this strategy is the support of the basic soil observation: the size and shape of the volume of material that is collected and then analysed to return a single soil datum. Many, but not all, soil sampling schemes use aggregate supports in which material from a set of more than one soil cores, arranged in a given configuration, is aggregated and thoroughly mixed prior to analysis. In this paper, it is shown how the spatial statistics of soil information, collected on an aggregate support, can be computed from the covariance function of the soil variable on a core support (treated as point support). This is done via what is called here the discrete regularization of the core-support function. It is shown how discrete regularization can be used to compute the variance of soil sample means and to quantify the consistency of estimates made by sampling then re-sampling a monitoring network, given uncertainty in the precision with which sample sites are relocated. These methods are illustrated using data on soil organic carbon content from a transect in central England. Two aggregate supports, both based on a 20 m 20 m square, are compared with core support. It is shown that both the precision and the consistency of data collected on an aggregate support are better than data on a core support. This has implications for the design of sampling schemes for soil inventory and monitoring.

We will focus on recent developments which were applied to large scale real world instances. Most railroad companies apply a hierarchically structured planning process. Starting with the definition of the underlying network used for transport one has to decide which infrastructural improvements are necessary. Usually, the rail system is periodically scheduled. A fundamental base of the schedule are the lines connecting several stations with a fixed frequency. Possible objectives for the construction of the line plan may be the minimization of the total cost or the maximization of the passengers's comfort satisfying certain regulations. After the lines of the system are fixed, the train schedule can be determined. A criterion for the quality of a schedule is the total transit time of the passengers including the waiting time which should be minimized satisfying some operational constraints. For each trip of the schedule a train consisting of a locomotive and some carriages is needed for service. The assignment of rolling stock to schedule trips has to satisfy operational requirements. A comprehensible objective is to minimize the total cost. After all strategic and tactical planning the schedule has to be realized, Several external influences, for example delayed trains, force the dispatcher to recompute parts of the schedule on-line.

The goal is to find the location and attractiveness of each facility going to be established by the leader who seeks to maximize its profit while also taking the follower's response into account. The attractiveness of each facility is a function of integer variables related to the facility's characteristics. Customer behavior is considered to be probabilistic based on the Huff gravity-based rule. To globally optimize the model, a procedure that handles the discrete decisions of the follower's problem is proposed. Afterward, by replacing the inner level convex program with its corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, the bi-level MINLP is converted into a single-level MINLP model, optimized by an improved branch-and-refine algorithm. Numerical experiments on randomly generated instances are conducted to illustrate the model's applicability.

In order to readily implement in computer and digital hardware, the order-6 discrete gradient-zeroing neural dynamics (O6-DGZND) algorithm is further proposed via the simultaneous combination of the order-6 Zhang time discretization (O6-ZTD) formula and the order-6 extrapolation (O6-E) formula. The O6-DGZND algorithm is not only highly accurate, but also utilized to solve the challenging Z-type future Moore-Penrose inverse problem. Besides, four other DGZND algorithms with low-precision are also presented to meet different precision requirements in actual engineering applications. The convergence properties of the DGZND algorithms, including the 0-stability, consistency, and truncation error, are theoretically analyzed. Numerical experiment results illustrate the efficacy and validity of the proposed DGZND algorithms, and the superiority of the O6-DGZND algorithm is also verified. In addition, with the aid of the O6-DGZND algorithm, an application on a UR10 robot manipulator tracking task is performed successfully, which implies that the practicability of the O6-DGZND algorithm in real-world applications.																			0957-4174	1873-6793				OCT 1	2023	227								120249	10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120249		MAY 2023											WOS:001000792500001

The numerical computations have been carried out employing a Finite Difference-Discrete Element (FDM-DEM) hybrid method. In the numerical simulations, the influences of the geometry and position of a square void with different dimensions and positions on the ultimate bearing capacity of the overlying shallow foundation, its load-displacement response, geogrid response and also the contact force network (CFN) underneath the footing have been rigorously examined. Moreover, the effects of the undrained shear strength of the underlying natural clayey deposit and the intervening geogrid stiffness on the behavior of surface footing have been evaluated. Results indicate that the bearing capacity of footing decreases by an increase in the width of the void while increasing the horizontal and vertical distances of void from the centerline of the surface footing suppresses its adverse effect. The negative impact of void on the bearing capacity of surface footing declines as the undrained shear strength of underlying clayey deposit increases. On the other hand, using a geogrid layer with higher stiffness leads to an increase in the ultimate bearing capacity of the overlying footing.

Based oil the nature of the demands. it may be convenient to set LIP lightpaths oil these networks with different bit rates. Then, the network design cost Could be reduced because low-bit-rate services will need less grooming (i.e.. less multiplexing with other low-bit-rate services onto high-capacity wavelengths) while high-bit-rate services call be accommodated on a wavelength itself. Future optical networks may support mixed line rates (say over 10/40/100 Gbps). Since a lightpath may travel a long distance, for high bit rates, the effect of the physical impairments along a lightpath may become very significant (leading to high bit-error rate (BER)); and the signal's maximum transmission range, which depends oil the bit rate. will become limited. In this Study. we propose a novel, cost-effective approach to design a mixed-line-rate (MLR) network with transmission-range (TR) constraint. By intelligent assignment of channel rates to lightpaths, based on their TR constraint, the need for signal regeneration call be minimized, and a "transparent" optical network can be designed to support all-optical end-to-end lightpaths. The design problem is formulated as all integer linear program (ILP). A heuristic algorithm is also proposed. Our results show that, with mixed line rates and maximum transmission range constraints, one can design a cost-effective network. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lu, WJ; Liu, DK				Lu, Wenjie; Liu, Dikai			A<SUP>2</SUP>: Extracting cyclic switchings from DOB-nets for rejecting excessive disturbances	NEUROCOMPUTING												Reinforcement Learning (RL) is limited in practice by its poor explainability, which is responsible for insufficient trustiness from users, unsatisfied interpretation for human intervention, inadequate analysis for future improvement, etc. This paper seeks to partially characterize the interplay between dynamical environments and a previously-proposed Disturbance OBserver net (DOB-net). The DOB-net is trained via RL and offers optimal control for a set of Partially Observable Markovian Decision Processes (POMDPs). The transition function of each POMDP is largely determined by the environments (excessive external disturbances). This paper proposes an Attention-based Abstraction (A(2)) approach to extract a finite-state automaton, referred to as a Key Moore Machine Network (KMMN), to capture the switching mechanisms exhibited by the DOB-net in dealing with multiple such POMDPs. A(2) first quantizes the controlled platform by learning continuous-discrete interfaces. Then it extracts the KMMN by finding the key hidden states and transitions that attract sufficient attention from the DOB-net. Within the resultant KMMN, three patterns of cyclic switchings (between key hidden states) are found, and saturated controls are shown synchronized with unknown disturbances. Interestingly, the found switchings have previously appeared in the control design for often-saturated systems. They are interpreted via an analogy to the discrete-event subsystem of hybrid control.

It has been proved that the memristive nonlinearity used as a nonlinear coupler to connect two dynamical systems has rich multi-stability phenomena and complex synchronous behaviors. However, few reports have extended memristive couplers and dynamical systems from continuous-time domain to discrete-time domain. To this end, this article proposes a simple memristor-coupled Logistic map (MCLM) model by coupling two identical Logistic maps through a memristive coupler. The MCLM model owns two line fixed point sets related to memristor initial condition and their stability distributions are discussed based on three eigenvalues. The chaotic/hyperchaotic attractors with outstanding performance indicators are revealed using numerical methods, and the initial-related heterogeneous multistability and memristor initial-boosting homogeneous multistability are demonstrated by basins of attraction that have complex and fractal evolutions. Afterwards, by inspecting the synchronous behaviors of the two Logistic maps in the MCLM model, the lag and complete synchronization behaviors dependent on the coupling strength and memristor initial condition, especially the homogeneous synchronization behavior boosted by the memristor initial condition, are disclosed in succession. In addition, an MCU-based hardware platform is fabricated to experimentally validate the numerical results. Of particular interest, to the best knowledge of the authors, the initial-boosting synchronization has not been reported in the literature.

Based on a delay bi-decomposition idea, a proper Lyapunov functional is introduced, which takes into account more information on the interval-like time-varying delay and the neuronal activation function. This Lyapunov functional, together with an improved reciprocally convex inequality, is employed to derive a sufficient condition to design suitable Luenberger-type estimators by solutions to linear matrix inequalities.

It aims at solving the optimal control problem of a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems with control constraints. By introducing a generalized nonquadratic functional, the iterative ADP algorithm through globalized dual heuristic programming technique is developed to design optimal controller with convergence analysis. Three neural networks are constructed as parametric structures to facilitate the implementation of the iterative algorithm. They are used for approximating at each iteration the cost function, the optimal control law, and the controlled nonlinear discrete-time system, respectively. A simulation example is also provided to verify the effectiveness of the control scheme in solving the constrained optimal control problem.

J	Bertsimas, D; Sethuraman, J				Bertsimas, D; Sethuraman, J			From fluid relaxations to practical algorithms for job shop scheduling: the makespan objective	MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING												We design an algorithm, called the fluid synchronization algorithm (FSA), for the job shop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the makespan. We round an optimal solution to a fluid relaxation, in which we replace discrete jobs with the flow of a continuous fluid, and use ideas from fair queueing in the area of communication networks in order to ensure that the discrete schedule is close to the one implied by the fluid relaxation. FSA produces a schedule with makespan at most C-max + (1+2) P-max J(max), where Cmax is the lower bound provided by the fluid relaxation, I is the number of distinct job types, J(max) is the maximum number of stages of any job-type, and Pm,x is the maximum processing time over all tasks. we report computational results based on all benchmark instances chosen from the OR library when N jobs from each job-type are present. The results suggest that FSA has a relative error of about 10% for N = 10, 1% for N = 100, 0.01% for N = 1000. In comparison to eight different dispatch rules that have similar running times as FSA, FSA clearly dominates them. In comparison to the shifting bottleneck heuristic whose running time and memory requirements are several orders of magnitude larger than FSA, the shifting bottleneck heuristic produces better schedules for small N (up to 10), but fails to provide a solution for larger of N.																			0025-5610					MAR	2002	92	1					61	102		10.1007/s101070100272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s101070100272													WOS:000174872700003

Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are an established method to quantify consumer preferences. The feasibility of using DCEs with people with intellectual disability is largely untested. Consenting participants eligible for disability support services (n = 18) participated in the mixed methods exploratory study. The DCE comprised a series of choices between two hypothetical service providers offering a combination of services relating to social and economic participation (e.g. support with finding and keeping a job), with four levels of service (no service, online support, group support, one to one support). Pictographs and simplified English were used to represent the hypothetical services and levels and a 'think aloud' protocol adopted. Most participants (N = 16, 89%) completed the DCE task. The findings from the think aloud task indicated that some participants were weighing up the options and making decisions based on their goals and personal preferences. However, other participants did not focus on all presented attributes and levels when making a decision; a common 'short-cut' heuristic also observed in DCE tasks with general population participants. Further research including investigating other DCE techniques, such as best-worst scaling, would be beneficial to identify how preference-elicitation tasks can be developed and applied with people with intellectual disabilities to ensure that future service innovations are designed and administered in ways which best meet their needs and preferences.

To account for such dependence, models at the length scale of material heterogeneity are required. These models involve multiple material parameters and are computationally intensive. Experimental data are needed to identify model parameters, and the highly nonlinear nature of the constitutive equations results in a challenging inverse problem. Direct inverse analysis (DIA) seeks the best parameter estimates by minimizing a well-defined objective function through an iterative optimization scheme. However, it is time-consuming, as just a single simulation is computationally costly. Another approach uses a machine learning (ML) model built from the complete mechanistic model, combined with an appropriate optimization algorithm. ML reduces the computational cost and enables parameter selection and feature importance as a by-product. This manuscript presents a comparative study between DIA and ML-based inverse analysis using the lattice discrete particle model, a state-of-the-art model simulating concrete at the coarse aggregate level. The study focuses on three mechanical tests: unconfined compression, hydrostatic, and tensile fracture. Experimental data was taken from the literature and augmented to form a consistent data set for a given mix design. Five different ML methods were explored, and results were compared with those from DIA. The two inverse analysis methods were compared in terms of goodness of fit and computational cost. Results confirm the validity of the identification procedure and show that inverse analysis based on ML reduces the computational cost by various orders of magnitude.																			0178-7675	1432-0924				SEP	2023	72	3			SI		593	612		10.1007/s00466-023-02320-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00466-023-02320-z		APR 2023											WOS:000963617200001

Based on functional decomposition, the dynamics can be decomposed into the altitude subsystem and the velocity subsystem. Furthermore, the discrete model could be derived using the Euler expansion. For the velocity subsystem, the controller is proposed by estimating the system uncertainty and unknown control gain separately with neural networks. The auxiliary error signal is designed to compensate the effect of throttle setting constraint. For the altitude subsystem, the desired control input is approximated by neural network while the error feedback is synthesized for the design. The singularity problem is avoided. Stability analysis proves that the errors of all the signals in the system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

A new discrete-time version of the dynamic event-triggering mechanism is proposed in terms of the absolute errors between control input updates. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov functional, the dynamics of each network node combined with the introduced event-triggering mechanism are first analyzed, and a sufficient condition is then provided under which the synchronization error dynamics is exponentially ultimately bounded. Subsequently, a set of the desired synchronization controllers is designed by solving a matrix inequality.

In this research, we propose a structure and texture disentanglement generative adversarial network (STD-GAN) to create automated mix-and-match designs. Our model is trained to disentangle fashion items into different style elements and to integrate these elements to create a new design in an unsupervised manner. More specifically, a fashion attribute encoder is developed to disentangle the features of fashion items into two representations based on structure and texture. A texture mapping network is then applied to encode the texture representation in the form of different spatial features. A fashion fusion decoder is also developed that can generate mixed-style fashion items by utilizing the structure representation and the different texture features. In addition, a multi-discriminator framework is proposed to determine the authenticity and texture similarity of the reconstructed and mixed fashion items. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our STD-GAN and its potential to facilitate the fashion design process by creating different textures and structures in a mix-and-match manner.																			0098-3063	1558-4127				FEB	2024	70	1					358	370		10.1109/TCE.2023.3329574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2023.3329574													WOS:001244895800246

Active queue management with discrete sliding modes in TCP networks	BULLETIN OF THE POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES-TECHNICAL SCIENCES												In this paper, a new active queue management (AQM) algorithm for data traffic control in TCP/IP networks is developed. The algorithm design is based on the principles of discrete sliding-mode control. Unlike majority of earlier studies, the design procedure considers the effects of both non-negligible delay in transferring data and feedback information and unpredictable capacity variations. The switching function is selected to incorporate a delay compensation mechanism, which ensures efficient network operation even for large bandwidth-delay product connections. The proposed algorithm, implemented as a packet marking scheme, is tested in discrete event ns-2 simulator. The results show that the algorithm provides fast convergence to steady state after sudden, unanticipated capacity changes. By generating smaller overshoots, the proposed algorithm also allows for reducing buffer space requirements to avoid packet loss as compared to the benchmark AQM solutions.

A discrete error singular stochastic network model of network-induced delay is initially constructed by utilizing the event-triggered communication scheme. Based on stochastic analysis and free-weighing matrix schemes, sufficient conditions are then established such that the resulting error time-delay stochastic model is stochastically admissible and strictly stochastically dissipative. By applying slack matrix variables and filter transfer function equivalent method, an event-triggered dissipative state estimated filter is designed to ensure stochastic admission and strictly stochastic dissipativity of the resulting singular stochastic model, provided if derived conditions satisfy sets of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approaches is verified by a numerical example.

The matching network is mainly constructed based on fragment discrete structure, which consists of regularly distributed metallic microstrip stubs, where some of them are connected whereas others are not. Different designs are generated by determining the interconnections between each two stubs. To facilitate the design procedure, a theory based on port impedance substitution is rigorously developed to calculate the resulted performance (reflection coefficient) of each design. Finally, the optimal design is obtained by using the derived formulas and genetic algorithm. The full optimization procedure is totally free of electromagnetic (EM) simulation and is quite timesaving. Three different examples of mismatched frequency-varying complex load are adopted to illustrate the steps and functionality of the proposed method. The accuracy of the proposed fast-calculation method is also verified by EM simulation and experimental results.

J	LING, CX				LING, CX			OVERFITTING AND GENERALIZATION IN LEARNING DISCRETE PATTERNS	NEUROCOMPUTING												Understanding and preventing overfitting is a very important issue in artificial neural network design, implementation, and application. Weigend [10] reports that the presence and absence of overfitting in neural networks depends on how the testing error is measured, and that there is no overfitting in terms of the classification error (symbolic-level errors). In this paper, we show that, in terms of the classification error, overfitting does occur for certain representations used to encode the discrete attributes. We design simple Boolean functions with clear rationale, and present experimental results to support our claims. In addition, we find some interesting results on the best generalization ability of networks in terms of their sizes.																			0925-2312					AUG	1995	8	3					341	347		10.1016/0925-2312(95)00050-G	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0925-2312(95)00050-G													WOS:A1995RQ64000007

An effective quantitative evaluation method for the transportation network efficiency is important as it can provide a feedback mechanism of network operation conditions in the process of network design, which gives a theoretical basis for the optimization of urban transportation network In general, a well designed transportation network should be adapted to multi typed traffic demands by considering their characteristics after reconstructing. Thus, on the choice of an effective quantitative evaluation method for the transportation network efficiency, this paper proposes a bi-level programming model with the objective of maximizing transportation network efficiency in mixed network design, which has two lower users' equilibrium models corresponding to two kinds of traffic demands. A hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Frank-Wolfe Algorithm is then developed to solve the proposed problem. Results of the case study show that the network designed by the proposed model a) results in a more rational distribution of traffic flow, b) improves the adaptability of the transportation network and alleviates the traffic congestion, and c) economizes on the use of land, providing a solid foundation for the sustainable development of transportation network					Tsui, Kwok-Leung/JTU-2163-2023; Tsui, Kwok-Leung/JVO-5706-2024	HE, Yuxin/0000-0001-8857-9990													2153-0009		978-1-7281-0323-5				2018							3846	3851																WOS:000457881303129

The output signals of the system under consideration are transmitted to the filter through a constraint communication network, which usually leads to network-induced delays and packet dropouts. By introducing a logic data packet processor to choose the newest data signal from the network to actuate the filter, network-induced delays and packet dropouts are modeled as a Markov chain taking values in a finite set. As a result, the filter to be designed is modeled as a Markov jumping linear filter. By introducing some slack matrix variables in terms of probability identity, a less conservative bounded real lemma (BRL) is derived to ensure that the filtering error system is stochastically stable with a prescribed H-infinity level. Based on this BRL, suitable H-infinity filters are designed by employing a cone complementary approach. A practical example on the Leslie model about some certain pest's structured population dynamics is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A database search was performed using PubMed and Scopus search engines. RCTs or quasi-experimental designs comparing clinical outcomes between treatments by a search of articles dated from inception to October 23, 2012. Unstandardized mean difference (UMD) and random effects methods were applied for pooling continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. A longitudinal mixed regression model was used for network meta-analysis to indirectly compare treatment effects. Eighteen of 315 studies identified were eligible. Compared with patellar non-resurfacing, patellar denervation had a UMD that displayed a significant improvement in symptoms with values in pain visual analog score (VAS) and Knee Society Score (KSS) of -0.6 [95 % confidence interval (CI) -1.13, -0.25] and 2.55 (95 % CI 0.43, 4.68), respectively. The UMD in VAS, KSS, and Knee Function Score (KFS) in patellar resurfacing showed no significant improvement in symptoms when compared to non-resurfacing. Patients who underwent surgery with patellar resurfacing had a lower reoperation rates with pooled relative risks (RRs) of 0.69 (95 % CI 0.50, 0.94) when compared to non-resurfacing. The network meta-analysis suggested a benefit of borderline significance for patellar denervation with a pooled RR of 0.63 (95 % CI 0.38, 1.03), showing that there is a lower chance of anterior knee pain when compared to non-resurfacing. Patellar resurfacing also displays a significantly lower chance of reoperation with a pooled RR of 0.68 (95 % CI 0.50, 0.92) when compared to non-resurfacing. Multiple active treatment comparisons indicated that patellar denervation resulted in greater improvement in KFS than patellar resurfacing. This review suggests that either patellar denervation or patellar resurfacing may be selected for the management of the patellofemoral component in total knee replacement. Patellar denervation may help improve postoperative knee function, but does not improve pain when compared to patellar resurfacing.																			0942-2056	1433-7347				JUN	2015	23	6					1770	1781		10.1007/s00167-014-3311-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-014-3311-z								25218579					WOS:000354895200026
J	Lv, ZH; Cheng, C; Lv, HB				Lv, Zhihan; Cheng, Chen; Lv, Haibin			Blockchain-Based Decentralized Learning for Security in Digital Twins	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL												This work aims to analyze malicious communication behaviors that pose a threat to the security of digital twins (DTs) and safeguard user privacy. A unified and integrated multidimensional DTs Network (DTN) architecture is constructed. On this basis, the propagation process model of malware in the network is built to analyze the malicious propagation behavior that threatens network security. This model ensures the protection of mobile distributed machine learning system security. Blockchain technology is a distributed data protection mechanism with broad prospects. It is characterized by decentralization, transparency, and anonymity, which can help ensure secure network data sharing and privacy protection. Based on this, this work designs a secure distributed data sharing (DDS) architecture based on blockchain to improve the security and reliability of data protection with the support of the Internet of Things (IoT). Then, digital resource allocation based on semi-distributed learning is examined to propose a broad learning federated continuous learning (BL-FCL) algorithm combining blockchain and DTs. This algorithm significantly speeds up the model training process. Broad learning technology supports incremental learning. In this way, each client does not need to retrain when learning the newly generated data. In the experimental part, the prediction accuracy of BL-FCL on the mixed national institute of standards and technology data set is similar to that of the FedAvg-50 and FedAvg-80 schemes. As the number of devices increases from 1 to 6, the detection probability exhibits a rapid decrease. However, as the number of devices further increases from 6 to 10, the detection probability gradually decreases at a slower rate until it reaches 0. Comparatively, the prediction accuracy of the BL-FCL outperforms the federated averaging algorithm-based scheme by 20%-60%. The BL-FCL reported here can deal with the problem of inaccurate training while ensuring the privacy and security of users. This work is of great significance for ensuring the security of the DTN and promoting the development of the digital economy. The results can provide references for applying blockchain and distributed learning in the DT field.																			2327-4662					DEC 15	2023	10	24					21479	21488		10.1109/JIOT.2023.3295499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2023.3295499													WOS:001163472700030

A necessary and sufficient condition for robust output consensus of discrete-time networked NI systems without poles at +/- 1 is obtained by the IQC-based discrete-time NI (D-NI) stability result. Moreover, the robust output consensus problem can be solved by designing an unstable controller whose poles are related to transmission zeros of D-NI systems. The case of discrete-time networked NI systems with poles at 1 is also studied. These main results are related to all eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the network graph as well as the corresponding complementary IQCs at +/- 1 frequencies. Some corollaries are given by constructing appropriate IQC multipliers in order to simplify the main results. Finally, three examples are shown to explain the validity of the main results.

Part II: Discrete optimisation of radial networks and comparison with alternative design strategies	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION												This study extends the model for optimal environmental design of distribution systems presented in Part I to network analyses. In particular, a specific algorithm is developed to apply the proposed circuit design for CO2 emission minimisation to radial networks, the great majority of low-voltage ones, taking into account the presence of only discrete capacities available for cable selection. The implementation of the network design algorithm is illustrated for a realistic large low-voltage urban network in a UK framework. The results found are compared to two benchmark networks designed according to a peak-based minimum investment strategy and an optimal economic strategy that minimises the network life-cycle cost. The specific emission reduction cost due to larger asset investment when applying an optimal environmental design strategy is then quantified with respect to the two alternative strategies. In addition, the results are checked against different discount rates that indicate the attitude of the network operator towards the cost of capital. The analyses illustrated provide clear-cut insights on the environmental and economic implications of adopting different design strategies (in particular, the optimal environmental one introduced here) and represent a key asset for network operators and policy makers in the path towards designing more sustainable energy systems.

Typically, multiple network topology choices are compared under the balanced injection-to-global bandwidth criterion to identify the best candidate. However, deviating from this balanced criterion may not impact application performance adversely and is often done in practice due to other considerations such as monetary cost. In this paper, we identify different practical constraints that determine the number of nodes, routers, and links, and in turn, influence dollar costs and impact network design. We design network topologies under one or more such constraints which represent different design points (iso-{*} analysis). We then perform a comprehensive, comparative evaluation of three scalable network topologies - dragonfly, express mesh, and fat-tree - enabled by parallel discrete-event simulations (PDES) of relevant HPC workloads. We identify network topologies that perform best under different iso-{*} configurations and compare their performance per dollar based on market data.																					978-1-4503-6723-3				2019							1	12		10.1145/3316480.3325516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3316480.3325516													WOS:000482028000001

A modified active set algorithm for transportation discrete network design bi-level problem	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION					4th World Congress on Global Optimization (WCGO)	FEB 22-25, 2015	Gainesville, FL	Int Soc Global Optimizat, Ctr Appl Optimizat, Univ Florida, Dept Ind & Syst Engn				Transportation discrete network design problem (DNDP) is about how to modify an existing network of roads and highways in order to improve its total system travel time, and the candidate road building or expansion plan can only be added as a whole. DNDP can be formulated into a bi-level problem with binary variables. An active set algorithm has been proposed to solve the bi-level discrete network design problem, while it made an assumption that the capacity increase and construction cost of each road are based on the number of lanes. This paper considers a more general casewhen the capacity increase and construction cost are specified for each candidate plan. This paper also uses numerical methods instead of solvers to solve each step, so it provides a more direct understanding and control of the algorithm and running procedure. By analyzing the differences and getting corresponding solving methods, a modified active set algorithm is proposed in the paper. In the implementation of the algorithm and the validation, we use binary numeral system and ternary numeral system to avoid too many layers of loop and save storage space. Numerical experiments show the correctness and efficiency of the proposed modified active set algorithm.

Dynamic RAT Selection and Transceiver Optimization for Mobile-Edge Computing Over Multi-RAT Heterogeneous Networks	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL												Mobile-edge computing (MEC) integrated with multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs) is a promising technique for satisfying the growing low-latency computation demand of intelligent Internet of Things (IoTs) applications. Under the wireless MapReduce framework for executing nomographic functions, this article investigates the joint RAT selection and transceiver design for over-the-air (OTA) aggregation of intermediate values (IVAs) in multi-RAT MEC systems, while taking into account the energy budget constraint for the local computing and IVA transmission per wireless device (WD), so as to adapt to the instantaneous communication opportunities in multiple RATs and the dynamic computational task loads. To provide a complete Pareto optimal solution, we minimize the weighted sum of the computational mean squared error (MSE) of the aggregated IVA at the RAT receivers, the IVA transmission cost of the WDs, and the associated transmission time delay. The joint RAT selection and transceiver design problem for OTA aggregation of the IVAs is a nonconvex mixed-integer problem, which is NP hard. We develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the challenge by continuous relaxation and alternating optimization. Specifically, the optimal receive beamforming vectors at the gNB/access points (APs) are shown to be the minimum MSE (MMSE) filters. Exploiting the hidden convexity of the remaining subproblem, we obtain an efficient iterative algorithm by alternating between the RAT selection and the transmit coefficient variables for OTA aggregation of IVAs. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed design as compared to other existing schemes.

In continuous graph partitioning, each edge is partitioned in a continuous fashion between its endpoint vertices, and the objective is to minimize the largest load among the vertices. We show that the continuous graph partitioning problem is convex and non-differentiable, and we characterize a solution amenable to distributed computation. The continuous graph partitioning problem naturally arises in the context of camera networks, where intruders appear at arbitrary locations and times, and the objective is to design camera trajectories for quickest detection of intruders. Finally, we propose a surveillance strategy for networks of PTZ cameras and we characterize its performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As a result, a robust and high-precision online solution method is significant for TVNE. However, there are three main challenges for handling TVNE via the existing methods: First, short-time invariance assumption frequently leveraged in the existing methods leads to lagging errors that are difficult to eliminate. Second, it is difficult in dealing with unknown noise disturbance during the solution process, which causes low solution accuracy or solution failure. Third, existing continuous-time methods are hard to be implemented on digital equipments. In this article, an anti-noise discrete-time neural dynamics (DTND) is designed and studied to overcome the above issues systematically. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed model effectively eliminates the lagging errors and achieves the accurate solution of the TVNE in a noisy environment. Moreover, to verify the superior numerical computational property of the DTND model, the intention recognition of lower limbs is explored from the artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) framework. Specifically, a nonlinear artificial dynamic system (NADS) concerning the human surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals and joint information is established, which performs in parallel with the actual human lower limb physical experiments. Simulation results illustrate that, within the acceptable range of the digital computer, the controller designed by the DTND model can well guide the NADS to accurately recognize the motion intention of the human lower limb.

For the NMASs with a directed topology and constant delay, a novel protocol based on the networked predictive control scheme is proposed to compensate for communication delay actively. Using algebraic graph theories and matrix theories, necessary and/or sufficient conditions of achieving consensus are obtained, which indicates that, under the proposed protocol, the consensus is independent of the network delay and only dominated by agents' dynamics and communication topology.

DOTcvpSB, a software toolbox for dynamic optimization in systems biology	BMC BIOINFORMATICS												Background: Mathematical optimization aims to make a system or design as effective or functional as possible, computing the quality of the different alternatives using a mathematical model. Most models in systems biology have a dynamic nature, usually described by sets of differential equations. Dynamic optimization addresses this class of systems, seeking the computation of the optimal time-varying conditions (control variables) to minimize or maximize a certain performance index. Dynamic optimization can solve many important problems in systems biology, including optimal control for obtaining a desired biological performance, the analysis of network designs and computer aided design of biological units. Results: Here, we present a software toolbox, DOTcvpSB, which uses a rich ensemble of state-of-the-art numerical methods for solving continuous and mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) problems. The toolbox has been written in MATLAB and provides an easy and user friendly environment, including a graphical user interface, while ensuring a good numerical performance. Problems are easily stated thanks to the compact input definition. The toolbox also offers the possibility of importing SBML models, thus enabling it as a powerful optimization companion to modelling packages in systems biology. It serves as a means of handling generic black-box models as well. Conclusion: Here we illustrate the capabilities and performance of DOTcvpSB by solving several challenging optimization problems related with bioreactor optimization, optimal drug infusion to a patient and the minimization of intracellular oscillations. The results illustrate how the suite of solvers available allows the efficient solution of a wide class of dynamic optimization problems, including challenging multimodal ones. The toolbox is freely available for academic use.

Discrete-time neural network output feedback control of nonlinear discrete-time systems in non-strict form	AUTOMATICA												An adaptive neural network (NN)-based output feedback controller is proposed to deliver a desired tracking performance for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems, which are represented in non-strict feedback form. The NN backstepping approach is utilized to design the adaptive output feedback controller consisting of: (1) an NN observer to estimate the system states and (2) two NNs to generate the virtual and actual control inputs, respectively. The non-causal problem encountered during the control design is overcome by using a dynamic NN which is constructed through a feedforward NN with a novel weight tuning law. The separation principle is relaxed, persistency of excitation condition (PE) is not needed and certainty equivalence principle is not used. The uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop tracking error, the state estimation errors and the NN weight estimates is demonstrated. Though the proposed work is applicable for second order nonlinear discrete-time systems expressed in non-strict feedback form, the proposed controller design can be easily extendable to an nth order nonlinear discrete-time system.

Optimum synthesis of discrete capacitated networks with multi-terminal commodity flow requirements	OPTIMIZATION LETTERS												Network design problems arise in a wide range of applied areas including telecommunications, computer networks, and transportation. In this paper, we address the following discrete capacitated multi-terminal network design problem. Given a connected digraph G = ( V, A), a set of L potential facilities to be installed on each arc, and a set of K multi-terminal ( non-simultaneous) commodity flow requirements, the problem is to find a set of facilities to install in order to route the K nonsimultaneous flows while minimizing the total fixed plus variable costs.

J	Vellaipandian, K; Periasamy, RP; Balasubramanian, V				Vellaipandian, Kannan; Periasamy, Raja Priya; Balasubramanian, Venkatesan			Prediction and validation of constituent materials for concrete manufacturing using artificial neural network	INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS												The development of high-strength concrete is based on the mix proportion determined through mix design. After conducting multiple trials on the mix proportions, a typical concrete mix with the requisite strength can be achieved. As a result, the procedure takes far too long to complete a large number of mix design trials. Therefore, the requirement of advanced technology to save time, manpower, and material is required. This work is mainly focused on the creation of a MATLAB-based artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting concrete's compressive strength, determining the projected values of concrete's mechanical characteristics, and conducting a correlation between the results of the experiment and the predicted values. A total of 1030 pieces of mixed proportional data were collected from various researchers to train the neural network. And to validate the trained data, a total of five mix proportions were prepared as per the Indian standard code for mix design. From the results, there is a good correlation between the trained and experimental data. Furthermore, the error values are found to be minimal, and the test and experimental data are well correlated (R2 = 0.95).

Robust state estimation for discrete-time genetic regulatory networks with randomly occurring uncertainties	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS												In this paper, we investigate the problem of robust state estimator design for a class of uncertain discrete-time genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) with time varying delays and randomly occurring uncertainties. By introducing a new discretized Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional together with a free-weighting matrix technique, first we derive a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of global asymptotic state estimator for the discrete-time GRN model with time delays satisfying both the lower and the upper bound of the interval time-varying delay. Further, the obtained results are extended to deal the robust state estimator design for the discrete-time GRN model in the presence of randomly occurring uncertainties which obey certain mutually uncorrelated Bernoulli distributed white noise sequences. The proposed criterions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved via Matlab LMI toolbox. Finally, the robust state estimator design has been implemented in a gene network model to illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the obtained theory.

MRIII is used for training the network which is more robust for implementing mixed-signal designs. The problem of node addressing and routing for implementing the MRIII is solved by performing the operations in current mode and using a counter. Arrays of mixed-signal multiplying-digital-to-analog (MDAC) blocks are used for synaptic multiplication. A compact architecture with a more linear transfer function is proposed for the MDAC to reduce the area, power consumption and noise. The proposed network is implemented using TSMC CMOS 0. 18 mu technology. The results of an XOR (2-2-1) network are presented to show the generality of the design. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, an event-triggered communication scheme is proposed to determine whether or not the current sampled data can be transmitted to the quantizer. Secondly, a quantizer is used to quantify the sampled data, which can reduce the data transmission rate in the network. Next, through the analysis of network-induced delay's intervals, the discrete-time neural network, the event-triggered scheme and network-induced delay are unified into a discretetime Markov jump delayed neural network.

The reaching law parameters, which were previously determined by a conventional design method, are regulated adaptively by two feedforward neural networks (FNNs) respectively.

J	Canelon, JI; Shieh, LS; Karayiannis, NB				Canelon, JI; Shieh, LS; Karayiannis, NB			A new approach for neural control of nonlinear discrete dynamic systems	INFORMATION SCIENCES												This paper proposes a new approach to control nonlinear discrete dynamic systems, which relies on the identification of a discrete model of the system by a neural network. A locally equivalent optimal linear model is obtained from the neural network model at every operating point the system goes through during the control task. Based on the linear model, a linear state-space control design technique can be used to design a local control action to be applied at that particular operating point. The design procedure is repeated at every operating point of the system during the control task. The proposed approach was applied in three examples, which involved a linear and two nonlinear discrete single-input single-output (SISO) systems. In the first two examples, pole placement was chosen as the linear design technique. This method led to satisfactory tracking of the reference input but a steady-state error was present due to modeling inaccuracies. In the third example, the linear design technique involved an optimal control scheme with an integrator. This method led to satisfactory tracking of the reference input with zero steady-state error.

This neural network was designed to obtain a non-parametric approximation (identification) of discrete-time uncertain nonlinear systems. A discrete-time Lyapunov candidate function was proposed to prove the convergence of the identification error. The adaptation laws to adjust the free parameters in the RNN were obtained in the same stability analysis. The control scheme used the states of the identifier, and it was developed fulfilling the necessary conditions to establish a behavior comparable with a quasi-sliding mode regime. This controller does not use the regular form of the switching function that commonly appears in the sliding mode control designs. The Lyapunov candidate function to design the controller and the identifier simultaneously requires the existence of positive definite solutions of two different matrix inequalities. As consequence, a class of separation principle was proven when the RNN-based identifier and the controller were designed by the same analysis. Simulations results were designed to show the behavior of the proposed controller solving the tracking problem for the trajectories of a direct current (DC) motor. The performance of the proposed controller was compared with the solution obtained when a classical proportional derivative controller and an adaptive first-order sliding mode controller assuming poor knowledge of the plant. In both cases, the proposed controller showed superior performance when the relation between the tracking error convergence and the energy used to reach it was evaluated.

Linear matrix inequality approach to static output-feedback stabilisation of discrete-time networked control systems	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												This study is concerned with the static output-feedback stabilisation problem of discrete-time networked control systems. If the controlled plant is a discrete-time system, the networked control system with time-varying network-induced delays and data packet dropouts in the transmission is modelled as a discrete-time system with time-varying delays in the state. The network-induced delays are assumed to have both an upper bound and a lower bound. Next, an asymptotic stability condition for the networked control systems is established, which depends on the upper and lower bounds of delay times. Then, three approaches to the static output-feedback controller are proposed, where the effect of both network-induced delays and data packet dropouts has been considered. Furthermore, the robust stability condition and controller design method for such networked control systems with structured uncertainties are presented. All the results are formulated in the terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are numerically very efficiently solved via LMI toolbox in the Matlab. Finally, three examples are worked out to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

The design problem then consists of identifying matches of pairs of quanta. The simulated annealing procedure builds chains consisting of contiguous matches in the discrete search space.

J	Jagannathan, S				Jagannathan, S			Admission controller design for high-speed networks: A hybrid system approach	JOURNAL OF HIGH SPEED NETWORKS												A novel real-time discrete-event admission control (AC) scheme for high-speed networks is proposed with the aim of attaining a desired quality of service (QoS) and high network utilization. The AC uses the available capacity from a novel adaptive bandwidth estimation scheme, a congestion indicator derived from a congestion controller, Peak bit/cell Rate (PBR/PCR) estimate from new sources, along with the desired QoS metrics, and makes decisions whether to "admit" or "reject" new sources so that the QoS metrics and network utilization are met. The admission controller dynamics are expressed as a discrete-event system while the bandwidth estimator design-based on Lyapunov theory and the congestion controller dynamics are given in discrete-time. The novel aspect of the proposed approach is the application of hybrid system theory to prove the performance of the proposed admission controller, stability and the development of rigorous and repeatable design procedure. The performance of the proposed AC is evaluated using the QoS metrics, which are given in terms of service delay, packet/cell losses, and network utilization. Simulation results are presented by streaming ON/OFF and MPEG video data into the network. Results show that the proposed AC admits significantly more traffic compared to other available admission control schemes thereby guaranteeing high network utilization while maintaining the desired QoS.																			0926-6801	1875-8940					2005	14	3					263	281																WOS:000231451500006

Although various reports have already been published on titania, including comprehensive review papers, the morphology-governed activity, especially for novel nanostructures, has not been reviewed recently. Therefore, this paper presents novel, attractive, and prospective titania photocatalysts, including zero-, one-, two-, and three-dimensional titania structures. The 1D, 2D, and 3D titania structures have been mainly designed for possible applications, e.g., (i) continuous use without the necessity of particulate titania separation, (ii) efficient light harvesting (e.g., inverse opals), (iii) enhanced activity (fast charge carriers' separation, e.g., 1D nanoplates and 2D nanotubes). It should be pointed out that these structures might be also useful for mechanism investigation, e.g., (i) 3D titania aerogels with gold either incorporated inside the 3D network or supported in the porosity, and (ii) titania mesocrystals with gold deposited either on basal or lateral surfaces, for the clarification of plasmonic photocatalysis. Moreover, 0D nanostructures of special composition and morphology, e.g., magnetic(core)-titania(shell), mixed-phase titania (anatase/rutile/brookite), and faceted titania NPs have been presented, due to their exceptional properties, including easy separation in the magnetic field, high activity, and mechanism clarification, respectively. Although anatase has been usually thought as the most active phase of titania, the co-existence of other crystalline phases accelerates the photocatalytic activity significantly, and thus mixed-phase titania (e.g., famous P25) exhibits high photocatalytic activity for both oxidation and reduction reactions. It is believed that this review might be useful for the architecture design of novel nanomaterials for broad and diverse applications, including environmental purification, energy conversion, synthesis and preparation of "intelligent" surfaces with self-cleaning, antifogging, and antiseptic properties.

The algorithm achieves its efficiency by carefully and dynamically refining partially time-expanded network models so that only a small number of small integer programs, defined over these networks, need to be solved. An extensive computational study shows that the algorithm performs well in practice, often using time-expanded network models with size much less than 1% (in terms of number of variables and constraints) of a full time-expanded network model. The algorithm is inspired by and has many similarities to the dynamic discretization discovery algorithm introduced in Boland et al.

Optimizing asphalt mix design process using artificial neural network and genetic algorithm	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS												Selection of aggregate gradation and binder content for asphalt mix design, which comply with specification requirements, is a lengthy trial and error procedure. Success in performing mix design rely largely on experience of the designer. This paper presents development of an automatic mix design process with the ability to both predict and optimize asphalt mix constituents to obtain desired mix properties. A successful automatic process requires the use of local past experience translated into a design aid tool, which then predicts properties of asphalt mix without actually testing the mix in laboratory. In the proposed approach, simple multilayer perceptron structure Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were developed using 444 Marshall mix design data. The ANN models were able to predict both air voids and theoretical maximum specific gravity of asphalt mix to within +/- 0.5% and +/- 0.025, respectively, for 99.6% of the time. After that, the ANN models were called by a non-linear constrained genetic algorithm to optimize asphalt mix, while satisfying the Marshall requirements defined in the formulation as constraints. Durability of the optimized mix is ensured by introducing a constraint on adequacy of asphalt film thickness. The developed mix design aid tool is compiled into a computer software called Asphalt Mix Optimization (AMO) that can be used by road agencies as a mix design tool. A case study is presented to demonstrate the ability of the model to optimize aggregate gradation and minimize binder content in asphalt mix. The computed ANN outputs and the optimized gradation were found to compare well with laboratory measured values. Although, Marshall compacted mixes were used in demonstrating the approach, this method is general and can be applied to any mix design procedure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An iterative Dual Heuristic dynamic Programming (DHP) algorithm has been envisaged to design the controller which is proven to converge to the optimal one.

Typical examples of such systems are railway networks, subway networks, and other logistic operations. In general the MPC control design problem for these systems leads to a nonlinear non-convex optimization problem. We also show that the optimal MPC strategy can be computed using an extended linea complementarity problem.

Analysis of Functional Architectures for Discrete Event Logistics Systems (DELS)	2015 CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS ENGINEERING RESEARCH	Procedia Computer Science				Conference on Systems Engineering Research	MAR 17-19, 2015	Hoboken, NJ					The functional design of discrete event logistics systems (DELS) specifies the systems' transformative functions independently from the technology required to implement those functions. Creating a functional architecture for a new system is as much an art form as a science and often relies on the tacit knowledge of the systems architect. In this paper, we present a method to integrate analyses to support the refinement of the functional architecture. This method relies on integrating the description of the functional architecture with a formal network description and using that formal network description to provide access to analysis generation technologies. The result is automated access to analysis tools, such as discrete event simulations, which provide critical feedback on the performance of a particular design early in the design process.

However, the high cost of building a quantum network testbed seriously hinders the research progress of quantum networks, and the existing simulators have been developed with less exposure to network models. To overcome those deficiencies, this article proposes a new discrete-event driven network-layer simulation framework named SimQN, available at https://github.com/ertuil/SimQN, to provide full functionalities of the quantum networking simulation. The design goal of SimQN is to make it easy-to-configure while providing high performance and accurate simulation capability. We present multiple simulation physical backends to enable different functionalities and reduce computational overhead. The modularized SimQN also provides reusable network protocols and utilities to release the large-scale quantum networking evaluation burden. We present several demonstrations and analyses to illustrate the protocol design and the performance of SimQN.

To be cost effective, the carrier must consolidate shipments, which requires coordinating their paths in both space and time; i.e., the carrier must solve a service network design problem. Most service network design models rely on discretization of time-i.e., instead of determining the exact time at which a dispatch should occur, the model determines a time interval during which a dispatch should occur. While the use of time discretization is widespread in service network design models, a fundamental question related to its use has never been answered: Is it possible to produce an optimal continuous-time solution without explicitly modeling each point in time? We answer this question in the affirmative. We develop an iterative refinement algorithm using partially time-expanded networks that solves continuous-time service network design problems. An extensive computational study demonstrates that the algorithm not only is of theoretical interest but also performs well in practice.

This makes the optimal management and design of a WDS a complex problem. Water quality has also become a significant factor in the design and management of a WDS. Our objective was to incorporate water quality uncertainty in the WDS design problem. The mixing level was assumed to be uncertain and used to design the WDS such that the design was immune to the level of mixing. This method aimed to yield designs that satisfied the nodal concentration constraints irrespective of the mixing level in the junctions. Two optimization methodologies, robust optimization and info-gap decision theory combined with a cuckoo search optimization algorithm, were proposed to solve this problem. An illustrative example 4 x 4 grid network was used to understand nonuniform mixing and explain the design methodology using both methodologies. Then these methodologies were applied to solve a similar treatment plant problem on a modified Fossolo network. The results also exhibited a significant variation in cost between complete mixing and nonuniform mixing. The WDS designs obtained from both methods were evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations.

An event-triggered controller (ETC) with mode-dependent random deception attacks is put forward such that the considered system realizes exponential stabilization almost surely (ES a.s.). The ETC is not only mode-dependent but also excludes Zeno behavior automatically with tunable parameters to adjust the event-triggering (ET) numbers according to practical needs. By using the ergodic theory and designing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, two criteria are set up to ensure the ES a.s. It is interesting to discover that the ETC is not necessary to control each mode to be stable and the dwell time of an unstable mode can be very large, which greatly reduces the conservatism and saves the control cost. Moreover, the weights of ET mechanism and control gains are obtained for all the switching modes by solving linear matrix inequalities. A simulation example is given to illustrate the merits of theoretical analysis.

A unified model consisting of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator is employed to describe these systems, such as chaotic neural networks, Chua's circuits, Henon map, etc. Based on the H-infinity performance analysis of this unified model using the linear matrix inequality approach, H infinity state estimator are designed for this model with sensors to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the estimation error dynamic systems and to reduce the influence of noise on the estimation error. The parameters of these filters are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem. As most discrete-time chaotic systems with or without time delays can be described with this unified model, H-infinity state estimator design for these systems can be done in a unified way.

Different from the conventional microstrip matching structure, the fragment-type structure is used to increase the flexibility of optimization for a sharp roll-off at the second harmonic band. By using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, a filtering output matching network (OMN) with the fast transition between the passband and stopband is designed and optimized. For verification, a 1.5-3 GHz broadband CCF-1 PA is designed, simulated and measured. Simulated results show that, compared with conventional Chebyshev filtering OMN design, the operational bandwidth of the proposed design can be expanded by about 15%.

Traditional APP models employ a single objective function to optimize monetary issues only. In this paper, we present a multi-objective APP model to analyze economic, social, environmental, and cultural pillars inclusively; moreover, each pillar includes several sub-pillars in the model. The resulting model includes an accurate representation of the problem with binary and continuous variables under sustainability considerations. We illustrate the effectiveness of the model in an appliance manufacturer and solve the problem using an exact solution method for multi-objective mixed-integer linear programs (MOMILP). We find a large number of the non-dominated (ND) points in the objective function space and analyze their trade-offs systematically. We show how this framework supports multiple criteria decision making process in the APP problems in the presence of sustainability considerations. Our approach provides a comprehensive analysis of the ND points of sustainable APP (SAPP) problems, and hence, the trade-offs of objective functions are insightful to the decision makers.					; Turkay, Metin/F-9769-2011	Rasmi, Seyyed Amir Babak/0000-0001-6765-1498; Turkay, Metin/0000-0003-4769-6714													0360-8352	1879-0550				JUN	2019	132						348	360		10.1016/j.cie.2019.04.036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2019.04.036													WOS:000472693200026

At each location the inventory must be kept within predefined bounds, and the location specific supply and demand rates are constant throughout the time horizon. Each location can be visited several times during the time horizon, and the vehicle can visit the locations in any order as long as the capacity of the vehicle is not exceeded. Two models are presented, each defined on a different extended network. In a location-event model , the nodes are indexed by the location and the number of visits made so far to that location, while in a vehicle-event model the nodes are indexed by the location and the number of visits so far on the vehicle route. Both models are based on continuous time formulations. They are tightened with valid inequalities, and a new branching algorithm is designed to speed up the solution time of the models. Computational tests based on a set of maritime transportation instances are reported to compare both models and the corresponding tightened variants. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under consideration of the system profit, the uncertain demand of logistics network is measured by interval variables and interval parameters, and an interval planning model of discrete logistics network is established. The risk coefficient and maximum constrained deviation are defined to realize the certain transformation of the model. By integrating interval algorithm and genetic algorithm, an interval hierarchical optimal genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the model. It is shown by a tested example that in the same scenario condition an interval solution [3 275.3, 3 603.7] can be obtained by the model and algorithm which is obviously better than the single precise optimal solution by stochastic or fuzzy algorithm, so it can be reflected that the model and algorithm have more stronger operability and the solution result has superiority to scenario decision.

First, the principle of applying the Taylor polynomials for these mixed circuit networks is discussed. Herein, the trigonometric functions, commonly used to characterize distributed circuits, are expressed in the form of polynomials by the application of Taylor polynomials. Therefore, the transfer function of the mixed networks is simplified from a multivariable to a polynomial form. Following this, a generic circuit structure is proposed to design either a low-pass filter or a low-passing impedance transformer with specified port impedances. The desired filtering function uses the similar method to transform the trigonometric function into a format of polynomials. Under the equalization of the transfer function and filtering function, all the unknown design parameters are obtained. As two examples, a low-pass filter and a low-passing impedance transformer are synthesized, designed, and fabricated to experimentally verify the proposed design approach.

Using artificial neural network (ANN), the strengths of rubbercrete are predicted using literature data with water-cement ratio, percentage of CR, cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates and water as inputs. The desired output are identified as the compressive strength, flexural strength, splitting tensile strength and modulus elasticity of rubbercrete. From the result, it is concluded that different data set, different neural network parameters are required. The overall regression plot for the prediction achieved a correlation coefficient, R of 0.99157.

The coal was extracted with pyridine or carbon disulfide-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (CS2-NMP) mixed solvent, and the extracts obtained were further fractionated. The extract fractions were hydrogenated using Adkins catalyst under mild condition at 430 degrees C for 1 h. The structure of the oil (n-hexane solubles) obtained from each extract fraction was analyzed by mass spectrometry after column separation and the molecular models of the fractions including the extraction residue were constructed assuming associated structure of coal molecules. Finally, a model structure of Zao Zhuang coal which consists of a huge associate of coal molecules was constructed three-dimensionally using computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) by assuming an anisotropic model structure formed from a periodic boundary cell. Good agreement of the physical density (1.22 g/cm(3)) of the constructed model with that (1.29 g/cm(3)) observed experimentally suggests that Zao Zhuang coal has a possibility to have associated structure of coal molecules having a continuous distribution of molecular weight from the lighter fraction to the solvent-insoluble residue.

MDC is a promising solution to overcome packet loss in video transmission over noisy channels, particularly for real-time applications in which retransmission of lost information is not practical. A problem with conventional MDC is that the achieved side distortion quality is considerably lower than single description coding (SDC) quality except at high redundancies which in turn leads to central quality degradation. In this paper, a new mixed layer MDC scheme is presented with no degradation in central quality, and providing better side quality (approximately as much as that of SDC) compared to conventional methods. Also, this property directly leads to higher average quality when delivering the video in lossy networks. For each discrete cosine transform coefficient, we generate two coefficients: base coefficient (BC) and enhancement coefficient which are combined together. When all descriptions are available, they are decomposed and decoded to achieve high quality video. When one description is not available, we use estimation to extract as much of the BC as possible from the received description. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme leads to an improved redundancy-rate-distortion performance compared to conventional methods. The algorithm is implemented in JM16.0 and its performance for two-description and four-description coding is verified by experiments.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was undertaken in 62 survivors of moderate-to-severe TBI (> 1 year after injury) and 68 healthy controls during performance of a continuous performance test adapted for use in a mixed block- and event-related design. Survivors of TBI demonstrated increased reliance on adaptive task control processes within an a priori core region for cognitive control in the medial frontal cortex. TBI survivors also had increased activations related to time-on-task effects during stable task-set maintenance in right inferior parietal and prefrontal cortices. Increased brain activations in TBI survivors had a dose-dependent linear positive relationship to injury severity and were negatively correlated with self-reported cognitive control problems in everyday-life situations. Results were adjusted for age, education, and fMRI task performance. In conclusion, evidence was provided that the neural underpinnings of adaptive and stable control processes are differently affected by TBI. Moreover, it was demonstrated that increased brain activations typically observed in survivors of TBI might represent injury-specific compensatory adaptations also utilized in everyday-life situations.

The proposed network is designed for Mixed Line Rates (MLRs) i.e. 10/ 20/ 40 Gbps to meet the requirement of high volume of heterogenic traffic. Further, the investigation is focused on uniform channel spacing and mixed channel spacing for MLRs. Various multidimensional results are presented to highlight and evaluate the impact of XPM in term of carrier to noise ratio (CNR), input power, received output power and BER. It is depicted that mixed channel spacing for MLRs performs better than conventional uniform channel spacing. It is also investigated that the effect of XPM on the system performance can be minimized with an optimal launch power.

The goal of each expert system is the selection of the type of process performance, of the simulation methods needed, etc. A procedure of computer aided knowledge accumulation is suggested to facilitate the choice of process alternatives at different stages of continuous distillation scheme design. Mixtures with different types of phase diagrams have been analyzed. The efficiency of the procedure of computer aided knowledge accumulation strongly depends upon the criteria of choice of variants at each stage of design.																			0098-1354					JUN 1	1999	23			S			S665	S668		10.1016/S0098-1354(99)80163-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0098-1354(99)80163-X													WOS:000167562300163
J	Xu, LY; Gao, FF; Zhou, T; Ma, SD; Zhang, W				Xu, Liangyuan; Gao, Feifei; Zhou, Ting; Ma, Shaodan; Zhang, Wei			Joint Channel Estimation and Mixed-ADCs Allocation for Massive MIMO via Deep Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												Millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) is a promising technique for the next generation communication systems. However, the hardware cost and power consumption grow significantly as the number of radio frequency (RF) components increases, which hampers the deployment of practical massive MIMO systems. To address this issue and further facilitate the commercialization of massive MIMO, mixed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) architecture has been considered, where parts of conventionally assumed full-resolution ADCs are replaced by one-bit ADCs. In this paper, we first propose a deep learning-based (DL) joint pilot design and channel estimation method for mixed-ADCs mmWave massive MIMO. Specifically, we devise a pilot design neural network whose weights directly represent the optimized pilots, and develop a Runge-Kutta model-driven densely connected network as the channel estimator. Instead of randomly assigning the mixed-ADCs, we then design a novel antenna selection network for mixed-ADCs allocation to further improve the channel estimation accuracy. Moreover, we adopt an autoencoder-inspired end-to-end architecture to jointly optimize the pilot design, channel estimation and mixed-ADCs allocation networks. Simulation results show that the proposed DL-based methods have advantages over the traditional channel estimators as well as the state-of-the-art networks.					zhou, ting/KMX-1693-2024; Zhang, Wei/C-3736-2011	Zhang, Wei/0000-0002-1059-3642													1536-1276	1558-2248				FEB	2023	22	2					1029	1043		10.1109/TWC.2022.3200378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2022.3200378													WOS:000966815600001

J	Alazab, M				Alazab, Moutaz			A discrete time-varying greywolf IoT botnet detection system	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS												Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging network that is trending due to advances in computing and networking development. A botnet is an attack that threatens the IoT system because of the increased number of compromised connected IoT devices. The conventional counter measurements are unable to detect this attack. This problem becomes a hot topic for researchers and practitioners who introduced many secured solutions to stop the risks of a botnet attack. The intrusion detection systems are promising solutions to tackle botnet attacks and discover malicious patterns. Recently, many studies investigated the impact of reducing the number of dataset's attributes (features) on the performance of detecting IoT attacks. Selecting the relevant features in a dataset is a data mining technique that has been efficiently integrated with designing secured systems for detecting botnets. This research paper proposes a new system for discovering botnet attacks in the context of IoT by applying a wrapper feature selection (FS) technique using an improved algorithm inspired by the natural swarming architecture of gray wolves called Gray Wolves Optimization (GWO). The transfer function (TF) maps the standard GWO which is originally developed to work in continuous search space to perform its optimization job in discrete search space. Different types of TFs that belong to S type and V type groups are used to generate eight discrete versions of GWO to optimize the binary feature space. This study contributes by adopting time-variant TFs to identify the best time to switch the global search into local search to achieve trade-offs in the search job of the BGWO and approach to the best-optimized solution. Time-variant TFs facilitate the global search at the beginning of the search process to fetch new solutions in new regions of feature space. In the later phases of the search process, the need is to expose more searches in the local region to get the most optimized solution among the neighborhood solutions. A real IoT traffic that is represented by the N-BaIoT dataset is utilized to evaluate the BGWO and other compared methods. The comparison results of the experiments show that the time-variant TFs enhance the capability of the GWO optimizer in alleviating the premature conversion and finding the best feature subset within a reasonable running time. Therefore, the BGWO-TV-S1 is recommended to be integrated into the IoT network as an intrusion detection algorithm with accuracy 98.97%, fitness value 1.31%, 51.2210 selected features and running time 503.7132 s.

J	Sequeira, SE; Graells, M; Puigjaner, L				Sequeira, SE; Graells, M; Puigjaner, L			Off-line and on-line approach for optimal maintenance management of continuous parallel processes with decreasing performance	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												The efficiency of equipment units in chemical process plants decreases with time because of fouling, byproduct formation, catalyst deactivation, etc. Therefore, periodic equipment maintenance and/or cleaning are required to restore original operating conditions that allow the desired high productivity rates to be maintained. Maintenance imposes a tradeoff decision between the cost associated with equipment shutdown and the resulting benefit of improvements in productivity. When parallel processing lines are considered in a production facility, the problem becomes more complex because of the presence of material interrelationships. In this work, the solution to this complex maintenance problem is addressed by introducing a simple formulation (NLP) for the planning problem and a procedure for the subsequent implementation of the discrete decisions involved (clean or not, feed assignments) in a real-time environment. This methodology can be considered an extension of the real-time evolution (RTE) approach for continuous processes (Sequeira, S. E.; Graells, M.; Puigjaner, L. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2002, 41 (7), 1815). The main advantage of the proposed methodology is the robustness resulting from the use of on-line information, which reduces the model dependency and, thus, the undesirable effects of variability and plant-model mismatch. The proposed off-line and on-line approaches are tested with benchmark case studies, their performance is evaluated using dynamic simulations, and their long-term behavior is monitored via Monte Carlo simulations.
