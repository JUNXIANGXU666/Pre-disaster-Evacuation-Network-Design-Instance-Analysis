The effects of both the signal quantization and the network conditions are taken into consideration. In order to estimate the lower bound of quantization ranges directly, a new model of NCSs via quantized state feedback is presented, based on which a new quantized H. controller design method is proposed.

First, a new model of NCS is established that parameter uncertainty, network-induced delay, actuator saturation and faults, and the state error arising from the DETCS are taken into consideration in a unified framework. Second, based on the model, the set of invariance condition of the closed-loop fault NCS with actuator saturation is proposed, which is the delay-dependent and event-dependent sufficient condition for ensuring the system stability. Then, a co-design approach which includes both robust fault-tolerant controller and the corresponding trigger weight matrix is given via linear matrix inequalities. The reciprocally convex combination lemma and the improved Jensen integral inequality are employed to deal with the derivative terms of the Lyapunov-Krasovakii functional, which can reduce the conservatism and computation of the results. Finally, a simulation example is used to demonstrate the advantage and the effectiveness of the proposed co-design approach, meanwhile, the quantitative relationship between the system performance and the communication resources is provided.																			1660-9336		978-3-03835-312-6				2014	668-669						581	587		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.668-669.581	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.668-669.581													WOS:000348898100125

By using the stochastic stability theorem of discrete-time stochastic delay systems, we find sufficient conditions for mean square and almost sure consensus explicitly related to the network and control parameters. It is shown that if the network graph is balanced and strongly connected, then the weighted-average type control protocol can be properly designed to ensure mean square and almost sure consensus for any given time-delays and noise intensity coefficients.

Existing methods require full payment from SU, which blocked many potential "buyers," and thus limited the PU's expected income. To better improve PUs' revenue from spectrum trading in a CRN, we introduce a financing contract, which is similar to a sealed non-cash auction that allows SU to do financing. Unlike previous mechanism designs in CRN, the financing contract allows the SU to only pay part of the total amount when the contract is signed, known as the down payment. Then, after the spectrum is released and utilized, the SU pays the rest of payment, known as the installment payment, from the revenue generated by utilizing the spectrum. The way the financing contract carries out and the sealed non-cash auction works similarly. Thus, contract theory is employed here as the mathematical framework to solve the non-cash auction problem and form mutually beneficial relationships between PUs and SUs. As the PU may not have the full acknowledgment of the SU's transmission status, the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard arise in the two scenarios, respectively. Therefore, a joint adverse selection and moral hazard model is considered here. In particular, we present three situations when either or both adverse selection and moral hazard are present during the trading. Furthermore, both discrete and continuous models are provided in this paper. Through simulations, we show that the adverse selection and moral hazard cases serve as the upper and lower bounds of the general case where both problems are present.					song, ling/GQZ-5934-2022; Song, Lingyang/G-9657-2018; Song, Lu yang/HPF-0922-2023; Han, Zhu/ABG-1222-2021	Song, Lingyang/0000-0001-8644-8241; Song, Lu yang/0009-0006-5587-1630; 													0733-8716	1558-0008				MAR	2017	35	3					643	653		10.1109/JSAC.2017.2672178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2672178													WOS:000400412900010

Convolutional neural networks (CoNNs) belong to one of the most popular types of DNN architectures. This article presents the design and evaluation of an accelerator for CoNNs. The system-level architecture is based on mixed-signal, cellular neural networks (CeNNs). Specifically, we present (i) the implementation of different layers, including convolution, ReLU, and pooling, in a CoNN using CeNN, (ii) modified CoNN structures with CeNN-friendly layers to reduce computational overheads typically associated with a CoNN, (iii) a mixed-signal CeNN architecture that performs CoNN computations in the analog and mixed signal domain, and (iv) design space exploration that identifies what CeNN-based algorithm and architectural features fare best compared to existing algorithms and architectures when evaluated over common datasets-MNIST and CIFAR-10. Notably, the proposed approach can lead to 8.7x improvements in energy-delay product (EDP) per digit classification for the MNIST dataset at iso-accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art DNN engine, while our approach could offer 4.3x improvements in EDP when compared to other network implementations for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

FPGA based two-channel ECG sensor node for wearable applications	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings				4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM					Emergence and development of pervasive healthcare applications demand new solutions for continuous and long-term individual's health condition monitoring and harmful event detection or, if possible, prediction. Such solutions include, among others, development of wearable, low power and intelligent devices capable of real-time decision making based on physiological parameter analysis. In recent years a large number of wearable devices were designed solely for the purposes of data acquisition and wireless transmission with intent that any further analysis would be done off-line. Prototypes of wearable devices capable for real time on-body physiological parameters processing are at the present time still scarce. Appearance of low power, mixed signal and flash based FPGAs presents new possibilities in development of small, wearable, intelligent and low power real-time biological signal processors used for physiological parameter extraction. Amongst many physiological signals ECG is the key parameter for evaluating an individual's well being. The ECG contains vast amounts of data closely related to a person's health condition and as such demands broad analysis. Given the complexity of the signal, valuable analysis in many applications can be performed only by using great computational power and professional knowledge. Efficient implementation of data extraction and harmful event detection algorithms from the ECG on mobile platforms is one of the most complex and important areas of research and development in pervasive healthcare applications. To meet the needs of mobile physiological parameters acquisition and analysis we are developing a network of generic wearable FPGA sensor nodes. One of such nodes is a two-channel ECG processor designed for long term real-time analysis and harmful event detection. The fore mentioned ECG node is presented in this paper.																			1680-0737		978-3-540-89207-6				2009	22	1-3					1208	1211																WOS:000299998500289

A multi-stage supply chain network design problem with in-house production and partial product outsourcing	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING												We propose a mixed-integer linear programming model for a novel multi-stage supply chain network design problem. Our model integrates location and capacity choices for plants and warehouses with supplier and transportation mode selection, and the distribution of multiple products through the network. The aim is to identify the network configuration with the least total cost subject to side constraints related to resource availability, technological conditions, and customer service level requirements. In addition to in-house manufacturing, end products may also be purchased from external sources and consolidated in warehouses. Therefore, our model identifies the best mix between in-house production and product outsourcing. To measure the impact of this strategy, we further present two additional formulations for alternative network design approaches that do not include partial product outsourcing. Several classes of valid inequalities tailored to the problems at hand are also proposed. We test our models on randomly generated instances and analyze the trade-offs achieved by integrating partial outsourcing into the design of a supply chain network against a pure in-house manufacturing strategy, and the extent to which it may not be economically attractive to provide full demand coverage.

The problem of repairing military communication network under the circumstance of nodes are hit in the network is described. This paper propose a method to repair damaged network by adding edges to the damaged network topology, which aims at maximizing network invulnerability. Network topological connection cost is based on average connection degree. The repair model is established with the consideration of connect cost limit and network connectivity. The model solving method based on discrete artificial bee colony algorithm is designed. Finally, proposed repair method is tested and compared with other three edge addition repair methods with a specific case of network.

J	Sharma, S; Venkataraman, V; Ghosh, J				Sharma, Shivani; Venkataraman, Vivek; Ghosh, Joyee			Spectrally-Pure Integrated Telecom-Band Photon Sources in Silicon	JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY												We demonstrate theoretically the direct (filter-free) generation of spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs, and consequently high-purity heralded single photons at telecommunication wavelengths, in SOI (silicon-on-insulator) nanowaveguides via spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM). The inherent strong waveguide dispersion in such high-index contrast structures is employed for discrete-band phase-matching in order to suppress the pair spectral correlations, and to produce photons in the fundamental spatial mode for easy in-out coupling to single-mode optical fibers. Additionally, by optimizing the source parameters like waveguide length, dispersion and pump bandwidth, the group-velocity of generated photons is also engineered to further eliminate spectral correlations. Extensive numerical mode simulations for various waveguide widths are used to design intrinsically pure photon sources via joint spectral amplitude (JSA) engineering. Purity > 95% is shown to be achievable in a silica-clad SOI waveguide with a cross-section 220 x 600 nm(2) for typical values of length and pump bandwidth. The wavelength of these heralded single photons can be tuned in the range of 1266-1363 nm (similar to O-band) by varying the pump wavelength. Considering the high accuracy provided by silicon nanofabrication techniques, the feasibility of generating single photons across the wavelength range 1333-1425 nm (E-band) and 1437-1510 nm (S-band) for slightly different waveguide widths (625 nm & 650 nm) is also demonstrated. These filter-free integrated photon sources could be important for large-scale linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) and long-distance fiber-optic quantum key distribution (QKD) networks.

Protein-polysaccharide interactions: Phase behaviour of pectin-soy flour mixture	FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS												Biopolymers mixed systems have been widely studied in the past two decades, resulting in advances in knowledge of the key parameters involved in macromolecules-macromolecules interactions. Sound understanding and control of these parameters should enable food scientists to design coating or film with desired functional properties. In this study the phase behaviour of high methoxyl pectin and soy flour at pH 4.6 was investigated. The aim was to investigate the effect of different concentrations of pectin (P) and soy flour (SF) solution and different P/SF ratios on mixture phase behaviour. Pectin suspensions at 16 mg ml(-1) and 8 mg ml(-1) concentrations and soy flour suspensions at 13 mg ml(-1) and 6.5 mg ml(-1) concentrations were prepared and mixed together in different ratios (10/90, 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, 90/10). Turbidity and theological measurements were performed to obtain information on pectin-soy flour interaction in electrostatic compatibility conditions. The experimental data show that soy flour solution is a non-stable system in which complexes may be formed during aging. It becomes insoluble and settles to the bottom of the suspension. By blending charged soy flour, at high concentration, with anionic pectin an associative interaction between biopolymers occurs which stabilizes the protein in solution. The best pectin and soy flour suspension for forming film with a continuous network was at concentrations of 16 mg ml(-1) and 13 mg ml(-1). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among the research results in the field of robotic exploration, the boundary exploration algorithm based on rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) performs well in most scenarios, which guides the robot motion by taking the frontier with the maximum revenue value as the target point discretely. However, this discrete target selection scheme ignores the geometric continuity of the environment, and the robot often turns to another area before completing a geometrically continuous area (e.g., a complete room), which results in the disorderly motion of the robot and a relatively low exploration efficiency. This work proposes a heuristics biased sampling-based robot exploration strategy, which utilizes the semantic information of the environment as the heuristics to guide the robot exploration. First, a lightweight network model is proposed for heuristic object recognition. Second, a geometrically continuous region is estimated based on the heuristic object, and frontiers are then extracted in this region by using a biased sampling method. Finally, the heuristic information gain model is designed to determine the target frontier for the exploration, which instructs the robot to select the frontiers in the heuristic region with a higher priority. In this way, the robot can effectively use the heuristic knowledge of the environment to improve the efficiency of exploration. Compared with the RRT-based exploration methods in simulations and real-world environmental studies, and the experimental results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.																			0278-0046	1557-9948				JUL	2023	70	7					7102	7112		10.1109/TIE.2022.3203762	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2022.3203762													WOS:000967320700001

However, an urgent problem is how to provide power to the downhole sensor network. In this study, combining with the centrifugal softening effect and an oscillator with clearance, a bi-stable electromagnetic energy harvester (EMEH) is proposed to enhance the energy harvesting performance in the low-frequency rotation of the drill-string. The discrete dynamic equations of the coupled EMEHs & drill -string system are established by using the finite difference method and Lagrange's equations. The accuracy of the numerical simulation is validated through model test, and the effects of damping, excitation amplitude, speed and gravity on the performance of a single EMEH are analyzed through numerical simulation. Then, the coupled dynamic model is used to simulate and analyze the performance of the EMEHs in the drilling process of vertical wells and deviated wells. The numerical results show that the resonant frequency of EMEH is related to the excitation amplitude and rotating speed. It first decreases and then increases with the increase of the excitation amplitude, which can cover most frequencies below the resonant frequency of the linear system with delta(i0) = 0 mm. The variation range of the resonant frequency decreases with the increase of rotating speed. In vertical wells, the output power of EMEH increases with the increase of drill-string depth, and the maximum output power at the well bottom can reach 2.0 W. In deviated well, the output power is mainly generated by the continuous rotation of the drill-string and gravity, which increases with the increase of the well inclination.

J	Al-Salaymeh, A; Ashhab, MS				Al-Salaymeh, A; Ashhab, MS			Modelling of a novel hot-wire thermal flow sensor with neural nets under different operating conditions	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL												Thermal flow sensors with a wide dynamic range are widely applied in practical fluid flow measurements to yield local velocity information and also for volume flow-rate measurements. The importance of such flow sensors inspired the authors' investigations into wide-velocity range thermal sensors and the outcome of this work is summarized in this paper. The present novel sensor is mechanically the same as the hot-wire anemometer, but it is excited by discrete, widely separated, square waves of electrical current rather than a continuous current. The nominal output of the new sensor is a function of the time constant of the heated wire and thus also of the velocity of flow. The time constant decreases as the flow velocity increases, while the heat transfer increases. In this paper, the results obtained suggest that our measurements for flow velocity and volume flow rate are in very good agreement with the theoretical results for the present thermal flow sensor. A neural network has been trained with the output data for the flow sensor and tested on our measurements. It was observed that the quality of the results depends on the number of hidden neurons. The predicted values are close to the real ones which indicate the neural net model gives a good approximation for the calibration curve of the single wire thermal flow sensor under different operating temperatures. The sensor described here was developed for slowly changing unidirectional flows, and uses one wire of 12.5 mu m diameter. It is excited at 30 Hz frequency and its usable flow velocity range is 0.01-25 m/s. This yields an effective operating range and corresponds to a bandwidth of 1-2500. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

While the continuous transition is relatively well-understood, the underlying mechanisms of the explosive transition present a challenge to researchers. Most studies, however, pointed out the interaction between node dynamics and network topology as the fundamental feature of explosive synchronization in networks. In this study, we demonstrate the impact of Laplacian eigenvalue on the type of synchronization transition observed in complex systems. Through simulations, our results show that the sparsity of the Laplacian eigenvalues is the key to designing the synchronization transitions. The findings reveal that the sparse distributions lead to a jump in the evolution of the order parameter, explosive synchronization. Additionally, the nodes exhibit continuous synchronization in cases where the eigenvalues are broadly dispersed. This study examines three distinct chaotic systems - Chen, Rossler, and Lorenz - with five different Laplacian eigenvalue distributions. Surprisingly, the outcomes demonstrate that the synchronization transition is not mainly dependent on the internal dynamics of the nodes, highlighting a pivotal characteristic that can be used to design the precise control of complex networks.

Specifically, taking into account the time-varying priorities of reconnaissance tasks, we investigate how to maximize the overall reconnaissance utility by selecting an appropriate set of tasks and scheduling their execution sequence in the multiaccess edge computing server of the UAV. The ASSUMER problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which includes both integer and continuous variables and is proved to be NP-hard. To address this challenging problem, we first model the task scheduling subproblem as a single machine scheduling problem with the deterioration effect. We find out that the optimal task scheduling can be solved efficiently given any task selection variables and propose an optimal scheduling algorithm. Second, using the proposed scheduling algorithm, the ASSUMER problem is equivalent to a binary integer programming problem with respect to the task selection variable only. We prove that the objective function falls into the category of the submodular function and transform the original problem into the problem of maximizing submodular function with the energy constraint. Third, combining the proposed scheduling algorithm with submodularity, we design an effective approximation algorithm for the ASSUMER problem and prove that the algorithm has (1 - e(-1))/2 bicriterion approximation guarantee. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the overall reconnaissance utility and energy efficiency compared to five benchmark algorithms.

To fulfil this demand, wireless instead of classic wired communication networks can be used. This trend is supported by the advancement of new network standards such as 5G. Current design of wireless networks in production systems in the early planning phase relies on best practices and experience. In following planning phases worst case calculations are used to verify the network topology. Taking the dynamic behaviour of flexible production systems into account, networks are constantly changing. In this paper, existing discrete event simulation of production systems is augmented with planning components of wireless networks to allow a more precise planning of production systems using wireless communication.

J	Oya, S; Pérez-González, F; Troncoso, C				Oya, Simon; Perez-Gonzalez, Fernando; Troncoso, Carmela			Design of Pool Mixes Against Profiling Attacks in Real Conditions	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING												Current implementations of high-latency anonymous communication systems are based on pool mixes. These tools act as routers that apply a random delay to the messages traversing them, making it hard for an eavesdropper to guess the correspondences between incoming and outgoing messages. This hides the identities of communicating partners in the network, but it does not prevent an adversary continuously monitoring the network from unveiling the communication profiles of the users. In this paper, we tackle the problem of designing the delay characteristic of pool mixes so as to maximize the protection of the users against profiling attacks. First, we propose a theoretical model for users' sending behavior which we validate using three real data sets of a different nature. Then, we use this model to perform a privacy analysis of the system and obtain the delay function of the mix, which is optimal in the sense of protecting the users. Since computing the delay characteristic of this optimal pool mix requires information about the users' behavior, we also propose a user-independent but less effective mix design. We evaluate these pool mixes, comparing them with one of the most studied existing designs, the binomial pool mix. Our experiments show that an adversary against our optimal design may need up to 30 times as long to achieve the same level of disclosure as for a binomial pool mix.

This study proposes a smart soft sensor using various ML algorithms to control and predict the Coagulation and Flocculation Process (CFP). Optimizing and predicting the behaviour of a CFP is difficult due to its non-linear and complex behaviour. Therefore, ML computations is a proper method to overcome this challenge. However, one of the challenges of ML studies is the lack of sufficient data which we overcome by using an 8-year database of experiments. For prediction, this study compares different ML methods, including Random Tree, Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Quinlan's M5 algorithm with regression function (M5P), Linear Regression (LR), Simple LR, Gaussian method, Decision Stump method, Smola and Scholkopf's Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm with LR (SMOreg), and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Also, for optimization of the studied system, Central Composite Design designed the experimental data with the Response Surface Methodology (CCD-RSM). The most significant factors in turbidity removal are related to FeCl3 dosage, and slow mixing speed with < 0.0001 and 0.005 P-values. The present research findings show that the maximum removal efficiency of 92% is predicted using CCD-RSM under the optimal condition. In addition, ANFIS and RF models with R-2 of 0.96 and 0.92, have shown the highest accuracy levels for removing water turbidity. Finally, a Petri-Net model establishes a Conceptual model to intelligently conduct managerial insights for water treatments.

The CLSC network design is recognized as a strategic problem which ensures a useful and efficient supply chain management providing an optimal platform. The CLSC network design problem includes two types of decisions, strategic and tactical. This paper aims to determine the location of facilities which is recognized as a strategic decision. In addition, tactical decisions such as the amount of supplied raw material, the level of production, and shipments among the network entities are made through the proposed model. This paper is distinctive by introducing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based model which simultaneously optimizes the both forward and reverse chains. The model is implemented on a glass manufacturing industry to highlight the importance and applicability of the framework. Moreover, the study provides a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of parameters such as demand and return rates on strategic and tactical decisions in supply chain network.																			1750-9653	1750-9661					2019	14	3					169	179		10.1080/17509653.2018.1512387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17509653.2018.1512387													WOS:000472540500002

In the MEC system, the relay can assist not only task offloading but also task computation. Aiming at minimizing total energy consumption at the user terminal and the relay, the resource allocations, such as subcarrier allocation, power allocation, task partition, and offloading time and computation time allocation, are to be optimized, subject to a given task computation delay constraint. To achieve this goal, a novel cooperative MEC protocol is designed, where multicarrier subchannels are utilized for parallel task offloading by integrating the rateless coding technique. Then, under the newly designed protocol, the resource allocation optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem that is challenging to solve. To tackle this MIP problem, continuous relaxation and algebraic transformation techniques are applied to transform it into a convex problem in order to reveal the lower bound of energy consumption performance. After that, by equivalently rewriting the integer subcarrier allocation constraint in the original optimization problem as the intersection of a convex set and a d.c. (difference of two convex sets) set, the problem is solved by the successive convex approximation to achieve a practical and efficient resource allocation scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed jointly cooperative task offloading and computation scheme can significantly reduce the energy consumption as compared to the baseline schemes, where the relay only assists the task offloading or task computation.					hu, dieli/JSL-0364-2023	Zheng, Hui/0000-0002-0664-3096													2327-4662					JUL 15	2021	8	14					11487	11502		10.1109/JIOT.2021.3051234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3051234													WOS:000670585100038

There is an obvious difference in visibility of drilled hole between normal and defective drilled lotus seeds in the top view; thus, an online sorting method for drilled lotus seeds based on drilled hole detection is proposed in this study. First, a drilled hole detection model based on You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) is developed to detect the drilled hole features on the lotus seed surface. The model was tested and compared with the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) and Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) models, and it showed a better comprehensive performance in terms of accuracy and speed. A sorting control algorithm is also proposed to perform online sorting based on real-time drilled hole detection results. In addition, an auxiliary algorithm is proposed to pre-vent the boundary misjudgement of detected hole ownership between adjacent lotus seeds during continuous sorting. An online sorting system was designed, and sorting tests were performed. A sorting accuracy of 95.8% was achieved for the mixed defective and normal drilled lotus seed samples. The proposed method is expected to not only fulfil the practical requirements for the online sorting of drilled lotus seeds but also provide references for other agricultural products that require continuous online sorting based on the detection of local features.(c) 2022 IAgrE.

It can provide both continuous and discrete beam steering in two dimensions (elevation and azimuth) at a speed that is sufficient for various applications including some in defense. The antenna is completely passive and beam steering is achieved using near-field phase transformation by employing a pair of distinct rotatable stepped-dielectric phase transformers (SPTs) placed in the near-field region of a fixed radiating source. The antenna system has a steering and impedance-matching bandwidth of 40.6% from 26.5 to 40 GHz. A prototype of the beam-steering antenna system including a mechanical system to rotate each of the SPTs around the antenna axis has been fabricated and tested. The rotating SPT pair introduces a predetermined phase gradient to the input near-field and creates an output near-field that will radiate in an arbitrarily selected direction, which can be varied within a large conical region with a maximum apex angle of 104 degrees. The system exhibits predicted and measured peak gains of 21.5 and 21.25 dBi, respectively, and the measured gain variation over 2-D beam steering is less than 3 dB except at 36 and 39 GHz, where it rises to 3.6 and 3.1 dB, respectively. This beam steering method obviates the need for expensive phase shifters and distribution networks, which are also lossy at mm-wave frequencies. The measured results validate the predicted wideband matching and steering performance of the system with close agreement.

First, the so-called weighted average dwell time is proposed and applied to reduce the conservativeness of stability results for the studied system whose all modes are stable. Then, combination the slow and fast weighted average dwell time, new stability criteria of discrete-time switched systems with some modes unstable are given. Third, by using linear matrix inequalities, the design of stabilizing controllers for discrete-time switched linear systems is presented. At last, two numerical examples illustrate that the new schemes have larger feasible regions for the design of switching signals than the existing results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The packet dropouts and network-induced delays in the sensor-to-controller channel, and network-induced delays in the controller-to-actuator channel are taken into account. A linear estimation-based method is proposed to estimate the measurement output, and the non-uniform distribution characteristic of the measurement output arrival instant is taken into full consideration to establish a new model for the considered NCSs.

Because of the Universal function approximation of MIFREN, the first MIFREN called MIFREN, is used to estimate a long-term cost function, which demonstrates its a performance index for the tuning procedure. Another network or MIFREN, is designed as a direct controller via the human knowledge through defined IF-THEN rules. The selection procedure for any system parameters. Such as learning rates and some constant parameters, is represented by the proof of proposed theorems. The System's performance is demonstrated by computer simulations via selected nonlinear discrete-time systems. and corn pari soil results with other controllers to validate theoretical development.

It is supposed that the network topology is dynamic and the existence of a communication link between each two agents is stochastic. Based on the concept of discrete-time super-martingales, we propose a Lyapunov-based high order protocol which guarantees achieving almost sure consensus in the network in the presence of some conditions. The main contribution of the paper compared with existing results for consensus control of high order multiagent systems under stochastic networks is that the proposed consensus protocol in this paper requires no knowledge on the set of feasible topologies (topologies with nonzero probabilities), and can be designed without computing the eigenvalues of the coupling matrices associated with the feasible topologies. In this condition, the computational costs of the consensus protocol design will be decreased significantly. The results are validated via a numerical example. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute.

Such in-memory computing implementations use regular and repetitive circuit structures that take great advantage of design automation. An analog/mixed-signal standard cell design approach in combination with an automation framework has been developed to ease the design of such systems. The framework discussed here provides the basic functionality such as schematic and layout creation. It is based on manually designed standard cells and technology and topology parameters to steer the automation. The presented methodology drastically reduces the (re-)design time and engineering effort leading to a reduced time-to-market whilst errors occurring in manual executed circuit design can be avoided.																			2471-6170	2640-5563	979-8-3503-0385-8				2023										10.1109/DCIS58620.2023.10335979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DCIS58620.2023.10335979													WOS:001133946600018

Aperture controlled grouting - benefits of the discrete fracture network approach	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF MINING AND METALLURGY SECTION A-MINING TECHNOLOGY												Fractured rocks, specifically sedimentary sequences, present a particular challenge for grouting, as major connected fractures that must be sealed will rarely be intersected by vertical groutholes. The aperture controlled grouting (ACG) method can be readily applied using discrete fracture network (DFN) analysis approaches to understand the pattern of fractures that need to be grouted. Aperture controlled grouting then utilises a combination of the principles of fracture grouting and grouting intensity number (GIN) grouting for practical and cost-effective grouting of tunnel, dam, shaft, or environmental restoration projects. This paper illustrates the application of DFN techniques for fracture assessment for grouting design and then compares the ACG approach to more conventional grouting approaches based on recent grouting experience.

Phase-separated mixed-macromer hydrogel networks and scaffolds prepared by stereolithography	POLYMERS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES												Mixed-macromer networks prepared by using biodegradable functionalized oligomers and a combinatorial chemistry approach have shown to be networks with high water uptake, excellent mechanical properties, and good cell adhesion. This may be due to phase separation within these networks, although this has not been investigated to date. Here we show that these networks are indeed phase-separated. In differential scanning calorimetry experiments, T-g values of each constituent material used in the networks were observed. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments showed phase separation of the crystalline and amorphous phases of the networks in the dry state. In the hydrated state, however, the crystalline phase was not visible. Subsequently, we prepared designed porous 3D structures of the mixed-macromer networks by using stereolithography. We have shown that such structures have excellent mechanical properties with compression moduli of 20-170kPa. Unlike conventional synthetic hydrogels such as poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels, these structures do not fail under compression and return to their original dimensions after re-equilibration in water. This make these materials excellent candidates for soft tissue engineering of tissues such as menisci or intervertebral discs. Finally, a designed porous meniscus implant was prepared.

Ambulation mode classification has been proposed to address this issue. However, these approaches introduce discrete labels to the otherwise continuous task that is ambulation. An alternative approach is to provide users with direct, voluntary control of the powered prosthesis motion. Surface electromyography (EMG) sensors have been proposed for this task, but poor signal-to-noise ratios and crosstalk from neighboring muscles limit performance. B-mode ultrasound can address some of these issues at the cost of reduced clinical viability due to the substantial increase in size, weight, and cost. Thus, there is an unmet need for a lightweight, portable neural system that can effectively detect the movement intention of individuals with lower-limb amputation. Methods: In this study, we show that a small and lightweight A-mode ultrasound system can continuously predict prosthesis joint kinematics in seven individuals with transfemoral amputation across different ambulation tasks. Features from the A-mode ultrasound signals were mapped to the user's prosthesis kinematics via an artificial neural network. Results: Predictions on testing ambulation circuit trials resulted in a mean normalized RMSE across different ambulation modes of 8.7 +/- 3.1%, 4.6 +/- 2.5%, 7.2 +/- 1.8%, and 4.6 +/- 2.4% for knee position, knee velocity, ankle position, and ankle velocity, respectively. Conclusion and Significance: This study lays the foundation for future applications of A-mode ultrasound for volitional control of powered prostheses during a variety of daily ambulation tasks.

During the design of metasurfaces, optimization of components for polarization, amplitude distribution, phase distribution, and other factors is necessary. This process typically demands expert involvement and is time-consuming. In this paper, a metasurface inverse design method is introduced that combines a high-precision ultra-wideband spectrum forward prediction utilizing a neural network and a genetic algorithm. A neural network is constructed and trained to accurately predict the amplitude and phase of a 16 x 16 discrete grid structure with high degrees of freedom in the frequency range of 0.5-2 THz. Leveraging the neural network's ultra-fast spectrum prediction capabilities (producing approximately 1000 spectra per second), the average optimization time for a single component is reduced to 1.5 min. Finally, the effectiveness of this inverse design method is validated through the design and simulation of multifunctional reflective deflection metasurfaces with two sets of 3-bit frequency multiplexing and polarization multiplexing. The proposed metasurface inverse design method offers a new approach for the rapid design of components in complex application scenarios and holds significant reference value for metasurface designers. This paper introduces a multifunctional metasurface inverse design method, integrating a neural network and genetic algorithm for fast, high-precision, and low manual-dependency design of components in complex application scenarios. Neural networks play a role in accurately predicting spectra, while genetic algorithm are responsible for finding the structure that best meets the design requirements within discrete grid structures.image					zhang, yu/AFM-3947-2022	zhang, yu/0000-0002-5848-8892													2195-1071					MAY	2024	12	13								10.1002/adom.202302657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adom.202302657		DEC 2023											WOS:001124880800001

Asphalt Concrete Mix Design Optimization Using Autoencoder Deep Neural Networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												Asphalt concrete (AC) balanced mix design (BMD) is based on the selection of aggregate gradation, component volumetrics, and binder content to control pavement cracking and rutting potential. The Illinois Flexibility Index Test (I-FIT) and the Hamburg Wheel Tracking Test (HWTT) results, used to predict cracking and rutting potential, respectively, are used in the BMD approach. However, BMD generally relies on a trial-and-error process to identify the aggregate gradation and binder content needed to meet volumetrics and optimize I-FIT and HWTT results. Minimizing or eliminating the trial-and-error process would increase productivity and accuracy. Therefore, this study proposes an autoencoder deep neural network (ADNN) to develop optimized AC mix design alternatives that can meet a prescribed flexibility index (FI) and rut depth (RD). Autoencoders are a type of neural network designed for representation learning composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder detects a structured pattern in the original input data to create a compressed representation of the AC mix design. The decoder reconstructs the compressed representation. The proposed autoencoder is composed of an encoder of five hidden layers, a latent space of one node, and a five-hidden-layer decoder. Models were created from a database of 5,357 data sets that include mix properties, I-FIT FI, and HWTT RD (after data preprocessing was conducted). An autoencoder was then trained to predict the total binder content, and aggregate gradation based on a target mix type, FI, and RD.

For the sake of energy saving, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is employed in the design of state estimator for the discrete-time delayed neural networks. In order to handle the possible fluctuation of the estimator gain parameters when the state estimator is implemented, a resilient state estimator is adopted. By constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a sufficient condition is established, which guarantees that the estimation error system is bounded and the H-infinity performance requirement is satisfied within the finite time. Then, the desired estimator gains are obtained via solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is employed to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed state estimation scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thirdly, the discrete delay-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, stochastic system theory and Bernoulli probability distribution are employed to derive the stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Compared with previous works, the fading channels in the signal transmission are described clearly by setting the different channels coefficients of the lth-order Rice fading channels model. The closed-loop system is exponentially mean-square stable and prescribed H-infinity performance is guaranteed by designing the T-S fuzzy dynamic output feedback controller. The factorizations in the polynomial and the congruence transformation matrices are introduced to solve the LMIs, such that the controller gain matrices are determined. Finally, simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness of proposed methods. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Our approach is based on a convolutional neural network architecture that learns a grouping measure defined over a pair of pattern elements. Motivated by perceptual grouping principles, the key feature of our network is the encoding of element shape, context, symmetries, and structural arrangements. These element properties are all jointly considered and appropriately weighted in our grouping measure. To better align our measure with human perceptions for grouping, we train our network on a large, human-annotated dataset of pattern groupings consisting of patterns at varying granularity levels, with rich element relations and varieties, and tempered with noise and other data imperfections. Experimental results demonstrate that our deep-learned measure leads to robust grouping results.

J	Wan, XB; Fang, HJ				Wan, Xiongbo; Fang, Huajing			Fault detection for discrete-time networked nonlinear systems with incomplete measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE												This article addresses the problem of fault detection (FD) for discrete-time networked systems with global Lipschitz nonlinearities and incomplete measurements, including time delays, packet dropouts and signal quantisation. By utilising a discrete-time homogeneous Markov chain, an improved model which considers packet dropout compensation has been proposed to describe the above network-induced phenomena. We aim to design a mode-dependent fault detection filter (FDF) such that the FD system is asymptotically mean-square stable and satisfies a prescribed attenuation level. The addressed FD problem is then converted into an auxiliary H filtering problem of Markov jump system with time-varying delay. A sufficient condition for the existence of the FDF is derived in terms of certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When these LMIs are feasible, the explicit expression of the desired FDF can also be characterised. A numerical example is exploited to show the effectiveness of the results obtained.																			0020-7721	1464-5319				NOV 1	2013	44	11					2068	2081		10.1080/00207721.2012.684899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2012.684899													WOS:000320099900008

ODIN enables us to collect and analyze rich, contextual continuous-time data on both personal change and interpersonal interaction. It achieves this by supporting dynamic delivery of questions based on the currently sensed context of each participant. The ODIN system extends beyond static (or even stepwise dynamic) graph-theoretic renderings of social life and individual behavior by considering "social relationship" to be measured in terms of high-dimensional continuous-time trajectories. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing seamless incorporation of new sensors, and correspondingly sophisticated compound rules by which contexts of interest may be specified. As such, ODIN opens the door for a "smarter" social science based on continuous contextual data, and a "smarter" data science that is reflective and sociologically informed.																					978-1-7281-4034-6				2019							37	44		10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00051													WOS:000936421900006

Closed-loop supply chains in which used products can be returned for remanufacture are becoming increasingly popular. This paper introduces a two-phase approach to the design of supply chain networks taking into account carbon emission and remanufacturing. In the first phase, a continuous approximation model is used to design the forward supply chain network. The objective is to minimize the total forward network cost by simultaneously determining the number and the service areas of distribution centers (DCs) and the replenishment cycle time for DCs. A nonlinear optimization technique is used to solve the forward supply chain network design problem. In the second phase, a reverse supply chain network is formulated based on the results of the first phase to determine the optimal number and service areas of remanufacturing centers (RCs) and the replenishment cycle time for RCs. Finally, numerical analyses are conducted to show the solution approach and provide some managerial insights.					穆, 儒/HGC-6534-2022; Yu, Vincent/B-3580-2008	Tsao, Yu-Chung/0000-0001-5058-8728; Yu, Vincent/0000-0001-8975-0606													0956-5515	1572-8145				MAR	2018	29	3					693	705		10.1007/s10845-017-1296-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10845-017-1296-4													WOS:000426717400016

In data dissemination networks the division of client issued continuous aggregate queries into sub-queries and assignment of these sub-queries optimally to different data aggregators of data dissemination networks is a minimum weight set cover problem. In this paper we propose a primal-dual parallel algorithm for continuous aggregate query dissemination. A dynamic data dissemination network is a content delivery network implemented with a hierarchical network of data aggregators which is used in online applications like stock applications and meteorological applications. Optimal dissemination of continuous aggregate queries and designing algorithm for optimization is a very important issue in such applications.

However as the number of components increases, so does the probability of failure. Thus, both scalable and fault-tolerance of software are important issues in this field. To ensure reliability of the software especially under the failure circumstance, the reliability analysis is needed. The discrete-event simulation technique offers an attractive alternative to traditional Markovian-based analytical models, which often have an intractably large state space. In this paper we analyze reliability of a self-healing network developed for parallel runtime environments using discrete event simulation. The network is designed to support transmission of messages across multiple nodes and at the same time, to protect against node and process failures. Results demonstrate the flexibility of a discrete-event simulation approach for studying the network behavior under failure conditions and various protocol parameters, message types, and routing algorithms.

These neural networks, alternatively referred to as continuous time algorithms, are interpreted as dynamical closed loop control systems. The design is based on the control Liapunov function (CLF) method.

The uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop tracking errors and the neural network weights estimation errors is demonstrated via Lyapunov stability analysis.																			1085-1992		978-0-7803-9795-8				2006							1772	+																WOS:000245233803026

The model is based on a generalized disjunctive programming formulation that is transformed into a mixed-integer nonlinear program. The objective function is to minimize the total annual cost, which accounts for the cold utility consumption cost, the capital cost for the coolers and pumps, and the pumping costs. The model uses a stagewise superstructure that allows combinations of cooler arrangements in series or in parallel, as well as bypass, mixing, and splitting of the cold utility. The model also incorporates several constraints to meet some specified design codes.

J	Miao, ZJ; Yuan, BZ				Miao, ZJ; Yuan, BZ			Analysis and optimal design of continuous neural networks with applications to associative memory	NEURAL NETWORKS												The asymptotic stability of a continuous neural network is analyzed for associative memory. An optimal design method is proposed which ensures the highest associative memory speed and guarantees the storage of each desired memory with attractivity. The network asymptotic stability is analyzed by means of a new energy function, and four theorems are obtained. By comparing these theorems with existing ones, it can be shown that in some cases they are consistent, while in others they are not equivalent but complementary to each other. Further study results in two more generalized conclusions, of which the existing conclusions are special cases. The network optimal design method is proposed in terms of an optimal associative memory theorem. Two application examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal design method, which can be used to design the network for many applications.

In order to effectively save data transmission energy in wireless sensor networks, an event-driven output feedback control mechanism with discrete time invariant system is proposed. Firstly, the transmission strategy is derived by using approximate quadratic function. And the proposed transmission mechanism can be used to balance the actuator and wireless transmission rates. Secondly, the output feedback gain matrix is designed, the upper bound of the approximate quadratic function is calculated, and the corresponding output feedback controller is designed. Finally, the simulation results show that the energy consumption per data transmission is only 50 nJ/b.

In addition, we propose a design method of a stabilizing controller, where a boundary-input with boundary-valued feedback is considered. First, we characterize the control properties, such as controllability of such a PDE system, in terms of the corresponding ones of a finite-dimensional discrete-time system defined on the boundaries of the PDE system, which is derived by fully exploiting the method of characteristics. Since the obtained discrete-time system is low-dimensional, its analysis is relatively easier. Next, we propose a design method of a stabilizing controller based on this discrete-time system.

This opens up opportunities for the incorporation of cutting-edge multiplayer gaming technologies and immersive mixed reality (MR) systems. To support nuanced and original engagement with the newly pervasive nature of the digital in museums, an interdisciplinary group of international researchers, designers, and museum professionals have established a new network: the Designing Digital Heritage Network (DDHN). The network operates to support research, design production, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the development of innovative new pedagogies and programs to 'design' the postdigital curators of the future. This paper outlines the mission and vision of the DDHN, and suggests initial directions for future research in the postdigital heritage field focused on interdisciplinary, performative, and game design approaches to production and exhibition.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-75789-6; 978-3-319-75788-9				2018	10754						162	173		10.1007/978-3-319-75789-6_12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75789-6_12													WOS:000432429200012

Modeling of discrete fracmemristor and its application	AIP ADVANCES												Researches on the fracmemristor have aroused increasing interest in the last several years, but there are no reports on design of the discrete fracmemristor. Based on the fractional-order difference and the mathematical model of the charge-controlled memristor, the discrete fracmemristor is designed where the amount of charge is determined by a fractional-order discrete system. In the numerical simulations, it shows that the pinched hysteresis loops are observed, which imply that the proposed memristor satisfies the definition of the memristor. As an application, the fracmemristor sine map is designed, and multistability is observed regarding the initial conditions of both the memristor and system. It provides a potential model for different applications such as cellular neural networks, modulators, sensors, chaotic systems, and programmable digital circuits. (C) 2020 Author(s).

This paper extends the dynamic inversion technique to discrete-time systems by using a filtered prediction, and shows how to use a neural network (NN) for inverting the backlash nonlinearity in the feedforward path. The technique provides a general procedure for using NN to determine the dynamics preinverse of an invertible discrete time dynamical system. A discrete-time tuning algorithm is given for the NN weights so that the backlash compensation scheme guarantees bounded tracking and backlash errors, and also bounded parameter estimates. A rigorous proof of stability and performance is given and a simulation example verifies performance. Unlike standard discrete-time adaptive control techniques, no certainty equivalence (CE) or linear-in-the-parameters (LIP) assumptions are needed.																			0743-1546		0-7803-6638-7				2000							3534	3540																WOS:000172029000638

Real-world network events not only involve newly emerged edges but also affect larger regions owing to changes in the overall structure. However, most continuous DGNN methods only aggregate local neighborhood information and ignore the importance of global information, leading to the loss of structural and semantic information that is not aggregated during the evolution of networks. Therefore, we propose a continuous dynamic network representation learning model called the Transformer based Temporal Graph Neural Network (T-TGNN) to aggregate global event-driven information in continuous dynamic networks. Specifically, we first adopted ordinary neural differential equations to model continuous temporal changes in dynamic networks. Subsequently, we used transformer mechanisms to aggregate the temporal and structural information. To better utilize transformers to aggregate the impacts of large regional changes, we designed a spatial event coefficient based on an attention mechanism to describe the global range of event dependencies in dynamic networks. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on dynamic network benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. The T-TGNN achieved the best performance over state-of-the-art baselines of network embedding.					zheng, Li/JVN-7465-2024; Chen, Jin/KBQ-0163-2024	Chen, Jin/0009-0005-5844-635X; Sun, Mingchen/0000-0002-7199-0836; Li, Yingji/0000-0002-3575-1395													0020-0255	1872-6291				NOV	2023	649								119596	10.1016/j.ins.2023.119596	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2023.119596		SEP 2023											WOS:001073068400001

Moreover, packet dropout phenomenon, which is supposed to be uncertain so as to be more realistic, is taken into account in the network channel from sensor node to filter node. By applying a novel Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the filtering error of the neural network system to be strictly (Q, S, R)-gamma-dissipative.

For periodic nonlinear systems, the sinusoidal state activation functions can provide more efficient mapping than the sigmoidal state activation functions. A matrix trace based online learning algorithm is constructed to train the output weights of SESN. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the asymptotical convergence of the identification error to zero is proved. A nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous (NARX) input model is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed identification method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Modelling advective gas flow in compact bentonite: Lessons learnt from different numerical approaches	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES												In a repository for radioactive waste hosted in a clay formation, hydrogen and other gases may be generated due to the corrosion of metallic materials under anoxic conditions, the radioactive decay of waste and the radiolysis of water. If the gas production rate exceeds the gas diffusion rate within the pores of the clay, a discrete gas phase will form and accumulate until its pressure becomes large enough to exceed the entry pressure of the surrounding material, at which point dilatant, advective flow of gas is expected to occur. The purpose of Task An under DECOVALEX-2019 is to better represent the processes governing the advective movement of gas in both low-permeability argillaceous repository host rocks and clay-based engineered barriers within numerical codes. In this paper special attention is given to the mechanisms controlling gas entry, flow and pathway sealing and their impact on the performance of the engineered clay barrier. Previous work suggests gas flow is accompanied by the creation of dilatant pathways whose properties change temporally and spatially within the medium. Thus, four new types of approaches have been developed: (i) standard two-phase flow models (continuous techniques) incorporating a range of different mechanical deformation behaviours, (ii) enhanced two-phase flow models in which fractures are embedded within a plastic material (continuous techniques) or incorporated into the model using a rigid-body-spring network (discrete approaches), (iii) a singlephase model incorporating a creep damage function in which only gas flow is considered, and (iv) a conceptual approach used to examine the chaotic nature of gas flow. The outputs from these different approaches are compared. This is an essential step as the choice of modelling approach strongly impacts the representation and prediction of gas flow in a future repository. In addition, experience gained through this task is of direct relevance to other clay-based engineering issues where immiscible gas flow is a consideration including hydrocarbon migration, carbon capture and storage, shale gas and landfill design. This paper summarises the outcomes of work in Task A conducted between May 2016 and May 2019 and provides a brief overview of the experimental data and a synthesis of the work of the participating modelling teams.

The optimal design problems arising from this kind of applications share three interesting properties: (i) measurements are only available at a small number of locations of the network; (ii) each monitor can simultaneously measure several quantities, which can be modeled by "multiresponse experiments"; (iii) the observation matrices depend on the topology of the network. We give an overview of these experimental design problems and recall recent results for the computation of optimal designs by Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP). New results for the network-monitoring of a discrete time process are presented. In particular, we show that the optimal design problem for the monitoring of an AR1 process can be reduced to the standard form and we give experimental results.																			1210-3195						2012	51						161	171		10.2478/v10127-012-0016-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10127-012-0016-x													WOS:000314254900016

Central to the study is defining how fracture attributes relate to fracture network structure and network-scale fluid flow, and in turn, how flow characteristics of fracture networks influence horizontal drain length and orientation. Multiple realizations of stochastic fracture networks, generated from both synthetic and field-specific data sets, serve as a basis for understanding physical fracture network structure and resultant global flow and for performing intersection analyses of hillslope drains with flowing fractures. Study results indicate that the logarithm of the standard deviation of fracture transmissivity, log(sigma(T)), is the single most important attribute for drainage network design, as higher values of log(sigma(T)) describe heterogeneous flow patterns where only a small portion of the network conducts a significant quantity of fluid. Thus recommended drain lengths for intersecting significantly conductive fractures increase with increases in log(sigma(T)). Fracture trace length, orientation, and density also play a role, albeit secondary to the distribution of transmissivity, in defining drain length as a function of drain orientation relative to the mean fracture set orientation. The spatially discontinuous nature of fracture networks and the wide range in transmissivity values found in natural fracture networks tend to produce high degrees of variability in computed intersection distances between drains and fractures conducting significant quantities of fluid. To account for this variability, a conservative approach is recommended where horizontal drain lengths along a pre-defined orientation are scaled by discrete fracture network computed intersection distances equal to the upper 95th confidence interval.

We prove that the proposed game, with a carefully chosen payoff function, falls into the framework of potential games where pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) exists. The feasibility of the pure strategy NE is guaranteed with properly designed penalty functions and penalty factors. It is revealed that the optimal solution to the sum discrete power minimization problem constitutes a pure strategy NE of the proposed game under mild conditions. Also, we prove that the pure strategy NE of the proposed game is also the optimal solution to the sum discrete power minimization problem under some particular conditions. An iterative algorithm is then devised to obtain the pure strategy NE. Two examples which can be solved efficiently by using our framework are also provided.																			2325-3746		978-1-5090-2860-3				2016																								WOS:000391540800054

For this purpose the following concepts are employed: (i) introduction of interaction activation functions, (ii) time-varying DTNN weights distribution, (iii) time-discrete domain synthesis and (iiii) one-step learning iteration approach.. The proposed DTNN synthesis procedure is useful for applications to identification and control of nonlinear, very fast, dynamical systems. In this sense a DTNN for a nonlinear robot control is designed. As the contributions of the paper, the following items can be cited. A nonlinear, discrete-time state representation of a neural structure was proposed for one-step learning. Within the structure, interaction activation functions are introduced which can be combined with input and output activation functions. A new very fast algorithm for one step learning of DTNN is introduced, where interaction activation functions are employed. The functionality of the proposed DTNN structure was demonstrated with the numerical example where a DTNN model for a nonlinear robot control is designed. This DTNN model is trained to imitate a nonlinear robot control algorithm, based on the dynamics of the full robot model of RRTR-structure. The simulation results show the satisfactory performances of the trained DTNN model.																					0-8194-2307-6				1996	2905						30	38		10.1117/12.256336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.256336													WOS:A1996BG67J00004

This paper gives an optimum design method of high-strength concrete for improving crack resistance based on orthogonal test artificial neural networks (ANN) and genetic algorithm. First, orthogonal test is operated to determine the influence of the concrete mix proportion to the slump, compressive strength, tensile strength, and elastic modulus, followed by calculating and predicting the concrete performance using ANN. Based on results from orthogonal test and ANN, a functional relationship among slump, compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, and mix proportion has been built. On this basis, using the widely used shrinkage and creep models, the functional relationship between the concrete cracking risk coefficient and the mix proportion is derived, and finally genetic algorithm is used to optimize the concrete mix proportion to improve its crack resistance. The research results showed that, compared with the control concrete, the cracking risk coefficient of the optimized concrete was reduced by 25%, and its crack resistance was significantly improved.

In the non-monotonic Lyapunov approach, the monotonicity requirement of the standard Lyapunov approach is not required. Based on the non-monotonic Lyapunov approach, sufficient conditions for the existence of an output stabilising feedback controller for discrete T-S fuzzy systems with and without uncertainties are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed design significantly reduces the conservativeness of the existing output feedback controller designs.

Recently, power consumption has become an important performance metric in telecommunication due to the associated environmental issues. In the recent bonding model, customer sites have been equipped with two/four copper pairs, which may be exploited for designing the grouped spatial modulation (SM) aiming for reducing the power consumption and mitigating the stubborn crosstalk in DSL communications. Explicitly, we view the two pair copper pairs equipped for each user as a group and propose an energy efficient transmission scheme based on the grouped SM strategy for the upstream DSL systems, which is capable of reducing the power consumption of the upstream transmitters by activating a single copper line of each user. More especially, in order to compensate for the potential bit-rate reduction imposed by reducing the number of activated lines, the proposed scheme implicitly delivers "virtual bits" via activating/deactivating the lines in addition to the classic modulation scheme. This is particularly beneficial in the DSL context because of the cross-talk imposed by activating several lines may swamp the desired signal. Furthermore, a pair of near-optimal soft turbo detection schemes are proposed for exploiting the unique properties of the DSL channel in order to eliminate the error propagation problem of SM detection routinely encountered in wireless channels. Both the attainable energy-efficiency and the achievable bit error ratio (BER) are investigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed group-based SM is capable of outperforming the vectoring scheme both in terms of its energy efficiency for all the examined loop lengths and transmit powers. Moreover, the proposed group-based SM is capable of outperforming the vectoring scheme both in terms of its BER performance in lower frequencies and longer serviced DSL loop lengths.

A network reliability concept is embedded into the continuous network design problem in which travelers' route choice behavior follows the stochastic user equilibrium assumption. A new capacity-reliability index is introduced to measure the probability that all of the network links are operated below their capacities when serving different traffic patterns deviating from the average condition. The reliability-based network design problem is formulated as a bi-level program in which the lower level sub-program is the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium problem and the upper level sub-program is the maximization of the new capacity reliability index. The lower level sub-program is solved by a variant of the method of successive averages using the exponential average to represent the learning process of network users on a daily basis that results in the daily variation of traffic-flow pattern, and Monte Carlo stochastic loading. The upper level sub-program is tackled by means of genetic algorithms. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the concept of the proposed framework.

To broaden this perspective, we introduce an integrated multi-dimensional mixed methods design in which several methods are used to address different dimensions of one overarching research question. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in a case study on the changing legitimation of economic regimes. In this case study a combination of descriptive statistics, discourse network analysis and narrative analysis is used to answer the question whether the post-2008 financial crisis has led to a legitimation crisis of the current capitalist economic regime.																			0023-2653	1861-891X				OCT	2017	69			2			185	212		10.1007/s11577-017-0457-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11577-017-0457-y													WOS:000410910100008
J	Fei, WW; Ni, HY; Yan, WX				Fei, Wenwei; Ni, Hongyu; Yan, Wenxu			Application of discrete event-triggered <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> control in wireless signal transmission of IOT	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING												With the development of network communication technology, the Internet of things (IOT) has penetrated into all aspects of society. IOT is mainly composed of a large number of equipment terminals. These terminals have mandatory communication ability and can receive or send data at any time through wireless networks, which will generate a huge amount of data. In the traditional control strategy, the terminals perform tasks periodically, which will inevitably lead to a large number of redundant data, not only waste valuable bandwidth resources, but also reduce the control performance of the system considering the network transmission delay. Therefore, a control method based on discrete event-triggered mechanism in wireless signal transmission is proposed. Considering the possible external interference, the disturbance signal is added, and a closed-loop time-delay system model which describes the discrete event-triggered mechanism and the performance of the system simultaneously is established. Then, based on Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality technique, H-infinity stability criterion and feedback controller design method are obtained. To deal with the nonlinear term, the cone compensation linearization algorithm is used. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the validity of the conclusions.

Taking into account quantization, possible data missing and sensor stuck faults, NCSs are modeled in the framework of discrete time-delay switched systems, and the finite frequency l(2) gain is adopted for the filter design of discrete time-delay switched systems, which is converted into a set of linear matrix in equality (LMI) conditions. By the virtues of the derived conditions, a procedure of reliable filter synthesis is presented. Further, the filter gains are characterized in terms of solutions to a convex optimization problem which can be solved by using the semi-definite programme method.

Equipment selection is one of the decisions to be taken in an initial phase of design. Mixing is an example of process where the selection of the equipment is practically realised 'by hand'. An application of rule-based or object-oriented tools in the selection of mixing equipment encounters many problems. The main reasons are the lack of well-structured knowledge and the great diversity of mixing problems. Case-based reasoning constitutes a good tool to handle the problems of mixing equipment selection. An instance generator for case-based reasoning system is described in this work. A fuzzy neural network system has been used to produce the cases, The following types of the equipment for heat exchange in stirred vessels have been considered: plain jacket, plain jacket with agitation nozzles, plain jacket with spiral baffles, dimple jacket, halfpipe jacket, helical coil, vertical coil and vertical plate coil.																			0941-0643						1999	8	2					106	113		10.1007/s005210050013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s005210050013													WOS:000081066400003

Two criteria for the existence of globally exponentially stable periodic solutions are developed. The first one can deal with the case where no bounds on the derivative of the discrete delay are given, while the second one is a refined version of the first one when the discrete delay is constant. Both stability criteria possess several adjustable parameters, which will increase the flexibility for designing impulsive control laws. In particular, choosing appropriate adjustable parameters can lead to partial state impulsive control laws for certain periodic neural networks. The proof techniques employed includes two aspects. In the first aspect, by choosing a weighted phase space PC alpha, a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique periodic solution is derived by virtue of the contraction mapping principle. In the second aspect, by choosing an impulse-time-dependent Lyapunov function/functional to capture the dynamical characteristics of the impulsively controlled neural networks, improved stability criteria for periodic solutions are attained. Three numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed results.

The network reliability strongly depends on not only the topological layout of the communication networks but also the reliability and availability of the communication facilities. The selection of optimal network topology is an NP-hard problem so that the enumeration-based methods grow exponentially with network size. This paper presents a new solution approach based on discrete particle swarm optimization (d_PSO) to design of communication networks. The design problem is to find the optimal network topology where total cost is minimum and all-terminal reliability is not less-than a given level of reliability. The effectiveness of the d_PSO is investigated comparing its results with those of obtained by GA given in the literature for the design problem. Computational results show that the d_PSO is an effective heuristic approach to design of reliable networks.

Here, a three echelon SC network is considered under demand uncertainty and the proposed integrated neuro-fuzzy and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach is applied to this network to realize the design effectively. Matlab 7.0 is used for neuro-fuzzy demand forecasting and, the MILP model is solved using Lingo 10.0. Then Matlab 7.0 is used for artificial neural network (ANN) simulation to supply a comparative study and to show the applicability and efficiency of ANN simulation for this type of problem. By evaluating the output data, the SC network for this case is designed, and the optimal product flow between the factories, warehouses and distributors are calculated. Also it is proved that the ANN simulation can be used instead of analytical computations because of ensuring a simplified representation for this method and time saving. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, only a limited number of studies have included stochastic transportation times in Service Network Design, which refers to decisions regarding transportation mode and services, so far. The paper on hand combines a Sample Average Approximation approach with Discrete Event Simulation for Service Network Design with stochastic transportation times, including the corresponding vehicle routing problem for road vehicles. The share of orders transported by intermodal road-rail vs. unimodal road transportation in dependence of costs and delays of the trains is evaluated for a generic transportation relation in Central Europe, backed by empirical data for transportation orders and delay distributions. The results show a strong effect of rail main haulage costs, whereas even for higher train delays road-rail transportation can still remain competitive.																			0891-7736		978-1-7281-3283-9				2019							1837	1848																WOS:000529791401065

However, empirical studies show that choice is social influenced by many factors beyond engineering performance of a product and consumer attributes. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a new choice modeling framework to capture the dynamic influence from social network on consumer adoption of new products. By introducing the social influence attributes into the choice utility function, the social network simulation is integrated with the traditional discrete choice analysis in a three-stage process. Our study shows the need for considering social impact in forecasting new product adoption. Using hybrid electric vehicle as an example, our work illustrates the procedure of social network construction, social influence evaluation, and choice model estimation based on data from National Household Travel Survey. Our study also demonstrates several interesting findings on the dynamic nature of new technology adoption and how social network may influence consumers' "green attitude" in hybrid electric vehicle adoption.																					978-0-7918-4502-8				2012							391	403																WOS:000335932800038

At first, three new fractional difference inequalities for exploring the upper bound of quasisynchronization error and adaptive synchronization are established by dint of Laplace transform and properties of discrete Mittag-Leffler function, which vastly expand a number of available results. Furthermore, two controllers are designed including nonlinear controller and adaptive controller. And on the basis of Lyapunov method, the aforementioned inequalities and properties of fractionalorder difference operators, some sufficient synchronization criteria of DFDNNs are derived. Because of the above controllers, synchronization criteria in this paper are less conservative. At last, numerical examples are carried out to illustrate the usefulness of theoretical upshots.

J	Gao, XR; Han, YQ				Gao, Xinru; Han, Yueqiao			Event-triggered sliding mode control for singular discrete-time fuzzy Markov jump networked systems	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL												In this present paper, the event-triggered sliding mode control (SMC) issue for a type of singular networked Markov jump systems with partly unknown transition probabilities (TPs) is mainly investigated, and it is modeled by discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems. To save network resources, a mode-dependent event-triggered scheme (ETS) is applied to improve transmission efficiency. Subsequently, a common sliding surface is designed, which can effectively reduce the impact of the jumping process. Therein, the stochastic admissibility criterion for the system with H infinity performance gamma is derived in the sense of partly unknown TPs. Moreover, a novel SMC law that guarantees the reachability of the quasi-sliding mode is given in view of the reaching condition. Finally, the validity of the presented theorems is demonstrated by a numerical example.																			0142-3312	1477-0369				2024 APR 13	2024										10.1177/01423312241232377	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01423312241232377		APR 2024											WOS:001201449500001

A Luenberger-type observer is designed for monitoring fault. By introducing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and by using Jensen's inequality techniques to deal with its derivative, a new sufficient condition for the existence of robust fault detection filter is proposed in the form of LMIs with nonlinear constraints.

Networked predictive control of systems with random delay in signal transmission channels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE												This article considers the design and stability of networked control systems with random delay in signal transmission channels. To deal with the random delay, a networked predictive control strategy is proposed for discrete networked systems. The key parts of the control strategy are the control prediction generator that provides a set of future control predictions and the network delay compensator that compensates for the network transmission delay. The analytical stability criteria of the closed-loop networked predictive control systems are derived for both fixed and random network delays.

Because of non-convexity of bi-level formulation of DNDP which stems from the equilibrium conditions, finding global optimal solutions are very demanding. In this paper, a new branch and bound algorithm being able to find exact solution of the problem is presented. A lower bound for the upper-level objective and its computation method are developed. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm is superior to previous algorithms in terms of both computation time and solution quality. The conducted experiments indicate that in most cases the first incumbent solution which is obtained within a few seconds is superior to the final solution of some of previous algorithms.

As a result, the concern on energy efficient network designs is increasing as the energy consumption is becoming a global environment problem. Minimizing energy dissipation and maximizing network lifetime are among main factors, aiming for optimized designs which lead to green applications. In an industrial application, various energy efficient network configurations can be designed. One such robust configuration is a hybrid wired-cum-wireless sensor network that is composed of a wireless sensor network and a wired backbone, which are inter-connected via access points. In this paper, the joint problem of configuring a hybrid wired-cum-wireless sensor network, position-constrained cluster head location, sensor nodes allocation, and position-constrained access point placement is addressed. The design considers real wireless communication limitations in the industrial applications, optimum locations of access points and cluster heads, and hybrid transmission structure of the network with the objective of minimizing the network energy consumption and configuration cost. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model and solved with "BARON". Numerical results show that the hybrid configuration is more energy effective than the wireless networks and leads to a longer lifetime at the expense of a more complex design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Fault detection for discrete-time systems in a networked environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE												This article is concerned with the fault detection (FD) problem for a class of linear discrete-time systems in a networked environment. The plant and its controller are located at diverse places, which are connected over network media to form a networked control system (NCS). A set of Kronecker delta functions is employed to characterise the delay and missing phenomenon, simultaneously, in both the backward and forward channels. After properly augmenting the states of the plant and the FD filter, an H(infinity) FD filter can be designed in solving a certain set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The residual is generated based on the data that can be obtained exactly at the controller and FD filter side. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we apply it to the leak FD for a discrete model, which is generated from the linearisation and discretisation of a practical internet-based nonlinear three-tank system. The fault can be detected within 1 min after its occurrence.

Furthermore, these visual models enable definition of design task patterns that can support design innovation management and learning across distributed teams.

A novel augmented observer is developed to simultaneously estimate system states, fault signals and the perturbed term caused by measurement delays. For this purpose, an augmented descriptor system is first established by considering the faults and the perturbed term as auxiliary state vectors. Then, a modified state-space observer is constructed to estimate the extended state. Intensive stability analysis is carried out to obtain the sufficient condition for the existence of the desired estimator, and the corresponding optimal observer parameters can be co-designed by solving a convex optimization problem.

The quality-of-control (QoC) in an NCS, i.e., the performance delivered by each closed-loop operation, depends not only on the controller design but also on the message scheduling strategy. In this paper, we show that the co-design of adaptive controllers and feedback scheduling policies allows for the optimization of the overall QoC. First, we discuss the limitations of standard discrete-time control models for controllers of control loops that are closed over communication networks.

In the sensor network, the redundant channel and the randomly varying nonlinearities are considered. The stochastic Brownian motions affect both the dynamical plant and the sensor measurement outputs. Through available output measurements from each individual sensor, the distributed state estimators are designed to approximate the states of the networked dynamic system. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the convergence of the estimation error systems for all admissible stochastic disturbances and randomly varying nonlinearities. Then, the distributed state estimator gain matrices are derived using the linear matrix inequality method. Moreover, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Bian, CZ				Bian Changzhi			A Nondominated Genetic Algorithm Procedure for Multiobjective Discrete Network Design under Demand Uncertainty	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												This paper addresses the multiobjective discrete network design problem under demand uncertainty. The OD travel demands are supposed to be random variables with the given probability distribution. The problem is formulated as a bilevel stochastic optimization model where the decision maker's objective is to minimize the construction cost, the expectation, and the standard deviation of total travel time simultaneously and the user's route choice is described using user equilibrium model on the improved network under all scenarios of uncertain demand. The proposed model generates globally near-optimal Pareto solutions for network configurations based on the Monte Carlo simulation and nondominated sorting genetic algorithms II. Numerical experiments implemented on Nguyen-Dupuis test network show trade-offs among construction cost, the expectation, and standard deviation of total travel time under uncertainty are obvious. Investment on transportation facilities is an efficient method to improve the network performance and reduce risk under demand uncertainty, but it has an obvious marginal decreasing effect.																			1024-123X	1563-5147					2015	2015								541782	10.1155/2015/541782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/541782													WOS:000361676200001

Asymptotic stability, mean-square stability, and stochastic stability are considered. For networked discrete-time linear systems, the packet loss period is assumed to be a finite-state Markov chain. We establish that the mean-square stability of a related discrete-time system which evolves in random time implies the mean-square stability of the system in deterministic time by using the equivalence of stability properties of Markovian jump linear systems in random time. We also establish the equivalence of asymptotic stability for the systems in deterministic discrete time and in random time. For networked sampled-data systems, a binary Markov chain is used to characterize the packet loss phenomenon of the network. In this case, the packet loss period between two transmission instants is driven by an identically independently distributed sequence assuming any positive values. Two approaches, namely the Markov jump linear system approach and randomly sampled system approach, are introduced. Based on the stability results derived, we present methods for stabilization of networked sampled-data systems in terms of matrix inequalities. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the design methods of stabilizing controllers.

A new discrete model of NCSs is derived considering the delay, quantization and delay probability distribution, which can translate the probabilistic effects of the delay to a parameter matrix of the transformed system. By using of the Lyapunov stability theory, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, convexity of matrix function, free-weighting technology and Jesson inequalities etc, the stability and stabilization criteria of the discrete NCS are proposed.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for constructing simulators that leverages virtual machines and combines advantages from the traditional systems-based and language-based simulator designs. We introduce JiST, a Java-based simulation system that executes discrete event simulations both efficiently and transparently by embedding simulation semantics directly into the Java execution model. The system provides standard benefits that the modern Java runtime affords. In addition, JiST is efficient, out-performing existing highly optimized simulation runtimes. As a case study, we illustrate the practicality of the JiST framework by applying it to the construction of SWANS, a scalable wireless ad hoc network simulator. We simulate million node wireless networks, which represents two orders of magnitude increase in scale over what existing simulators can achieve on equivalent hardware and at the same level of detail.

J	Brooks, RR; Zhu, MX; Lamb, J; Iyengar, SS				Brooks, RR; Zhu, MX; Lamb, J; Iyengar, SS			Aspect-oriented design of sensor networks	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING												The rapid technology development in wireless communication and embedded micro-sensing devices has made the distributed sensor networks (DSN) an area of national importance. Wireless sensor networks are an important military technology with civil and scientific applications. More importantly, the design and analysis of sensor networks can be quite complicated, since each node must simultaneously interact with many other nodes to achieve multiple goals. In this paper, we show how this problem can be made tractable by designing separate protocols for each aspect of a node's behavior. We model this discrete event system by Petri Nets and then formulate three aspect hierarchies: sensing, communications, and command. Within each aspect hierarchy, a node is dynamically assigned roles. To combine the hierarchies, control specifications are derived that enforce consistency across the aspects. Controllers are created using three discrete event methodologies to show how computationally independent aspect-oriented designs can be integrated to form a unified distributed system. The controller methodologies used are: (i) Petri Nets, (ii) finite state automata (FSA) using the Ramadge and Wonham approach, and (iii) vector addition control using the Wonham and Li approach. Finally, we contrast the controller design methodologies by presenting the advantages and disadvantages for each method. In conclusion, for our Petri Nets modeled DSN system with n places and m transitions, constructing Petri Nets controller is computationally efficient but with controller execution time complexity of O(n x m (2)). On the other hand, FSA controller provides prompt response with time complexity of O(n x m) at the cost of manual offline state space search and encoding. Thus this method is only applicable to medium and small size system. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Parallelization of the branch-and-bound algorithm in transportation discrete network design problem	SCIENTIA IRANICA												Transportation Discrete Network Design Problem (TDNDP) aims at choosing a subset of proposed projects to minimize the users' total travel time with respect to a budget constraint. Because TDNDP is a hard combinatorial problem, recent research has widely addressed heuristic approaches and ignored the exact solution. This paper explores how application of parallel computation can affect the performance of an exact algorithm in TDNDP. First, we show that the Branch-and-Bound (B&B) algorithm, proposed by LeBlanc, is well adapted to a parallel design with synchronized Master-Slave (MS) paradigm. Then, we develop a parallel B&B algorithm and implement it with two search strategies of Depth-First-Search (DFS) and Best-First-Search (BFS). Detailed results over up to 16 processing cores are reported and discussed in an illustrative example of the Chicago Sketch network. The results suggest an almost linear speedup for both strategies, which slightly drops as more processing cores are added. When using 16 processing cores, the speedup values of 11.80 and 12.20 are achieved for DFS and BFS strategies, respectively. Furthermore, the BFS strategy reveals a very fast parallel performance by finding the optimal solution via the minimum computational effort. (c) 2016 Sharif University of Technology.

Existing cross-modal retrieval methods based on deep hashing aim to learn the unified hashing representation for different modalities with the supervision of pair-wise correlation, and then encode the out-of-samples via modality-specific hashing network. However, the semantic gap and distribution shift were not considered enough, and the hashing codes cannot be unified as expected under different modalities. At the same time, hashing is still a discrete problem that has not been solved well in the deep neural network. Therefore, we propose the Discrete Fusion Adversarial Hashing (DFAH) network for cross-modal retrieval to address these issues. In DFAH, the Modality-Specific Feature Extractor is designed to capture image and text features with pair-wise supervision. Especially, the Fusion Learner is proposed to learn the unified hash code, which enhances the correlation of heterogeneous modalities via the embedding strategy. Meanwhile, the Modality Discriminator is designed to adapt to the distribution shift cooperating with the Modality-Specific Feature Extractor in an adversarial way. In addition, we design an efficient discrete optimization strategy to avoid the relaxing quantization errors in the deep neural framework. Finally, the experiment results and analysis on several popular datasets also show that DFAH outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for cross-modal retrieval.

In wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs), sensor nodes have limited energy resource and to increase the lifetime of the network, it is necessary to design an effective fast algorithm that aims at reducing the consumed power. This paper proposes an energy-efficient discrete cosine transform (DCT) approximation requiring only 12 additions. Associated with a JPEG compression chain, this DCT approximation ensures a very good rate-distortion compromise, but above all, a very low computational complexity and significant compatibility with the exact DCT. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed fast transform algorithm achieves a better trade-off between image quality, computational complexity and energy consumption compared to any existing pruned DCT approximations. Furthermore, it is very suitable for the resource constrained wireless visual sensor networks (WVSNs) requiring low bitrates.

Available graph layout algorithms are not adequate for satisfactorily drawing such networks. New methods are required to visualize automatically the topological architectures and facilitate the understanding of the functions of the networks. Results: We propose a novel layout algorithm to draw complex biochemical networks. A network is modeled as a system of interacting nodes on squared grids. A discrete cost function between each node pair is designed based on the topological relation and the geometric positions of the two nodes. The layouts are produced by minimizing the total cost. We design a fast algorithm to minimize the discrete cost function, by which candidate layouts can be produced efficiently. A simulated annealing procedure is used to choose better candidates. Our algorithm demonstrates its ability to exhibit cluster structures clearly in relatively compact layout areas without any prior knowledge. We developed Windows software to implement the algorithm for CADLIVE.

Flying ad hoc networks involves the aerial nodes that are capable to form the aerial ad hoc that can identify the ground nodes for potential data transmission between them. This allows formation of guidance map that can aloof any chances of network failures. Opportunistic network formation provides continuous connectivity between the aerial and the ground nodes. This can be realized using cross layer formation that operates over the parameters from multiple layers, and then finally a neural schema helps in attaining stabilization over the hybrid network. Cross layer design allows efficient service dissemination over the flying networks. In this paper, a cross layer based opportunistic network formation for flying network is presented that can provide continuous data sharing with efficient utilization of network resources between the aerial and the ground network. The Effectiveness of the proposed opportunistic network formation is presented using simulations.

Based on the theory of discrete fuzzy adaptive PID control algorithm, the braking force of a vehicle is analyzed and the anti-lock control target is set. The automobile adhesion coefficient and wheel slip rate are calculated as the input and output of the PID control algorithm to complete the control of the anti-lock brake system of the network automobile. Experiments show that the sliding rate of the discrete fuzzy adaptive PID control algorithm of the designed anti-lock system is close to 20%, which proves that the design method has good braking effect.

This paper proposes an effective and modular model to describe material, financial and information flow of SCs at the operational level based on first-order hybrid Petri nets (PNs), i.e., PNs that make use of first-order fluid approximation. The proposed formalism enables the SC designer to choose suitable production rates of facilities in order to optimize the chosen objective function. The optimal mode of operation is performed based on the state knowledge of the obtained linear discrete-time, time-varying state variable model in order to react to unpredictable events such as the blocking of a supply or an accident in a transportation facility. A case study is modeled in the proposed framework and is simulated under three different closed-loop control strategies. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of the present work is to provide a generic, simple and accurate model, able to integrate the material, financial and information flows description, for use by decision makers in SC management at the operational level. In particular, this paper proposes a model based on the first-order hybrid Petri net model formalism that provides SC designers with important key features. First, the model exhibits good computational efficiency and easy implementation in engineering software packages. Second, some SC design parameters, such as supplier and manufacturer production rates, are real continuous variables and can be determined by polynomial complexity optimization of suitable performance indices. Third, based on knowledge of the system state and information on the occurrence of typical operational unpredictable events (e. g., facility blockings and goods demands), the model enables the decision makers to update some operational design parameters in a closed-loop strategy. Future research aims to investigate on the decisional structure of the model in order to specify a decision support system based on the presented modeling framework.

Such designs remove storage servers from the path of data transfer leading to highly scalable file systems. While there exists many file systems built using such direct attached disks, they are all optimized for traditional text-based data and are not well-suited for streaming continuous media, i.e., audio and video data. In this paper we present the architectural details of a scalable distributed continuous media file system built using SAN-attached disks. We describe the implementation details of our Linux-based prototype and show by experimention that the performance of our file system scales linearly with the number of disks and the number of clients, and the file system provides strict bandwidth guarantees for continuous media streams.

Based on constructing the appropriate delay-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, the sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the asymptotic stability and alpha-safety degree of NNCS under DETCS, which is the contractively invariant set of fault-tolerant control with alpha-safety degree. Furthermore, the co-design method between robust fault-tolerant controller and event-triggered weight matrix is also proposed in this paper. Finally, the simulation experiment shows that the method described herein can not only make the closed-loop fault NNCS with actuator saturation possess a higher safety degree and a better dynamic performance, but also reduce communication load effectively.																			1948-9439		978-1-4799-7016-2				2015							3865	3872																WOS:000375232905041

The modeling and precise proportioning of the concrete mixture are important for expanding the application of HPC. There have been many efforts to develop an expert system for HPC mix proportioning, but the systems developed from these efforts are still somewhat complicated, time-consuming, and have uncertain tasks. In this paper, to provide a tool for the convenient design of HPC mixtures, mix proportioning programs using a new meta-heuristic algorithm called "Harmony Search", which was conceptualized based on a musical process of searching for a perfect harmony, is devised. The mix design programs developed by using harmony search algorithm were compared to other mix design approaches such as neural networks and genetic algorithm. The results showed that the harmony search algorithm can be a potentially strong tool for HPC mix proportioning.

One main problem is the asynchronous-mode switching between the neuron state and the estimator. Our goal is to design a mode-dependent estimator for the switched neural networks under average dwell time switching such that the estimation error system is exponentially stable with a prescribed l(2) gain (in the H-infinity sense) from the noise signal to the estimation error. A new Lyapunov functional is constructed that may increase during the mismatched switchings. New results on the stability and l(2) gain analysis are then obtained. The admissible estimator gains are computed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. The relations among the switching law, the maximal delay upper bound, and the optimal H-infinity disturbance attenuation level are established. The effectiveness of the proposed design method is finally illustrated by a numerical example.

First, an event-dependent intermittent mechanism is originally designed, which is described by the Lyapunov function and three non-negative real regions. The distinctive feature is that the controller starts to work only when the trajectory of the Lyapunov function goes into the presupposed work region. The proposed method fundamentally changes the principle of the existing intermittent control schemes. Under the proposed framework of the intermittent mechanism, the work/rest time of the controller is aperiodic, unpredictable, and initial value dependent. Second, several succinct sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are developed to achieve the quasisynchronization of the considered DNNs. A simple optimization algorithm is established to compute the control gains and the Lyapunov matrices such that synchronization error is stabilized to the smallest convergence region. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the designed intermittent mechanism.					cao, yutong/JJF-4531-2023; yang, zhou/JKI-3744-2023; long, chen/JVM-8568-2024; Li, Zilong/JEZ-8642-2023	Ding, Sanbo/0000-0002-1438-5330													2168-2267	2168-2275				FEB	2021	51	2					862	873		10.1109/TCYB.2020.3004894	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2020.3004894								32697731					WOS:000608690900032

For this purpose, a new mixed reliability index is developed. Furthermore, a fuzzy approach has been implemented to improve the constraints handling of the optimization model. Typically, crisp pressure and velocity constraints are used for water network design. However, in this paper, the effect of using fuzzy constraints is considered. Two well-known benchmark networks, the two-loop and the Hanoi focused on the proposed method. Finally, the results were discussed in several different cases of application. Also, a new modified layout for the two-loop was investigated.

Particularly, a novel networked predictive control (NPC) scheme is employed for the considered 2-D systems in order to compensate for the communication delay actively. Firstly, by using the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are established for such 2-D systems. Based on the stability analysis results, a new networked predictive controller design strategy is proposed to stabilize the addressed 2-D systems and also achieve the desired control performance.

The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game where the achievable rate of the cognitive relay network is used to design a common utility. This game is shown to be a potential game which possesses at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) and an optimal strategy profile that maximizes the rate of cognitive relay network constitutes a pure strategy NE of our proposed game. We prove that under some mild conditions, our proposed game can guarantee the feasibility of a pure strategy NE without advance knowledge of infeasible strategy profiles. Moreover, we find that the price of anarchy (PoA) of our proposed game is equal to 1 under some conditions. In order to achieve the pure strategy NE, we design a centralized iterative algorithm and a decentralized stochastic learning algorithm based on learning automata. The convergence and the complexity of our designed algorithms are discussed. It is shown that our designed algorithms can achieve optimal or near-optimal rate performance with low complexity.

To solve this problem, chose several state points to linearize the system on the condition of little perturbation. Based on H infinity mixed sensitivity theory, designed attitude angle control system, and utilized the error input and control output for sample collection, then built the RBF neural network which trained by the collected samples. Considering that different RBF neural networks need to select different learning rates, this will bring great inconvenience to the use of RBF. In order to solve such problem, a new type of dynamic optimal learning rate is derived, which will be optimized for each iteration. Tested the fully trained RBF neural network controller at non-design points. Simulation results show that the control system can track the attitude instruction excellently, the tracking speed is fast. And the neural network controller shows strong robustness and adaptivity in the whole flight envelope.																					978-1-5386-8243-2				2018							46	51																WOS:000455830800008

Each source in the considered networks is characterized by its own maximum transmission rate. Furthermore, data packets sent by the sources are transferred through lossy links and some of them can be lost before arriving at a common bottleneck node. The amount of data lost during the transmission is not known, but upper bounded for each source. If at some time the bottleneck link cannot transfer all arriving data, then the excess data is stored in a buffer with limited capacity. In order to eliminate data losses caused by the buffer overflow and to ensure full utilization of the available bandwidth, in this paper a new non-switching type reaching law for discrete time sliding mode control systems is proposed and applied to design a congestion controller for the networks.

In fact, communities are often overlapped with each other in many real-world networks, thus it is necessary to design overlapping community detection algorithms. To this end, this paper proposes a mixed representation-based MOEA (MR-MOEA) for overlapping community detection. In MR-MOEA, a mixed individual representation scheme is proposed to fast encode and decode the overlapping divisions of complex networks. Specifically, this mixed representation consists of two parts: one represents all potential overlapping nodes and the other delegates all nonoverlapping nodes. These two parts evolve together to detect the overlapping communities of networks based on different updating strategies suggested in MR-MOEA. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm MR-MOEA on ten real-world complex networks and the experimental results demonstrate that MR-MOEA is superior over six representative algorithms for overlapping community detection.

The AC uses the following information- the available capacity from a novel adaptive bandwidth estimation scheme, a congestion indicator derived from a congestion controller, Peak bit/cell Rate (PBR/PCR) estimate from new sources, along with the desired QoS metrics, and outputs an 'admit' or 'reject' decision signal to the new sources while guaranteeing QoS and network utilization. The dynamics of the admission controller is expressed as discrete-event system while the bandwidth estimator and the congestion controller dynamics are in discrete-time. The overall stability of the congestion plus the admission controllers is shown using hybrid system theory. The performance of the proposed AC is evaluated based on the predefined QoS metrics and network utilization. Simulation results are presented by streaming ON/OFF and video data into the network. Results show that the proposed AC admits significantly more traffic compared to other available admission control schemes thereby guaranteeing high network utilization while maintaining the desired QoS.																			0191-2216		0-7803-7516-5				2002							3638	3643																WOS:000181352300652

GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION OF NONLINEAR NETWORK DESIGN	SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION												A novel approach for obtaining globally optimal solutions to design of networks with nonlinear resistances and potential driven flows is proposed. The approach is applicable to networks where the potential loss on an edge in the network is governed by a convex and strictly monotonically increasing function of flow rate. We introduce a relaxation of the potential loss constraint and formulate the design problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program. A linearization-based approach with tailored cuts is proposed that improves the computational efficiency over a standard implementation. We have also implemented a simple heuristic approach for finding feasible solutions at the root node and during the search process. The algorithm has been implemented with IBM-ILOG CPLEX and is shown to be computationally effective on a number of examples from the literature.																			1052-6234	1095-7189					2013	23	1					268	295		10.1137/110827387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/110827387													WOS:000316857500013

Disassortative mixing patterns of drug-using and sex networks on HIV risk behaviour among young drug users in Yunnan, China	PUBLIC HEALTH												Objectives: The dominant mode of HIV transmission in China has changed from injection drug use to sexual contact. The objectives of this study were to describe the disassortative and assortative mixing patterns of drug-using and sex networks among young drug users in China. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was used to recruit young drug users in an egocentric network study in Yunnan, China. Egos were categorized as having disassortative mixing network patterns if they reported both sex and drug-using networks. Egos who only had a sex network (no drug-using network), or only a drug-using network (no sex network) were categorized as having assortative mixing network patterns. Multiple logistic regression was performed to analyze the relationships between disassortative patterns with risky sexual behaviour and drug-using practices. Results: A total of 426 participants were recruited into the study. Two hundred forty-two egos reported disassortative mixing patterns and 139 egos had assortative patterns. The RDS-adjusted proportion of having a disassortative pattern was 53.2%. Participants with disassortative patterns were more likely to engage in HIV risk behaviour compared to those with assortative patterns. Specifically, drug users with disassortative patterns reported more multiple sex partners (31.4% vs 19.6%), concurrent partnerships (52.1% vs 39.0%), non-regular sex partners (12.0% vs 4.3%), and sex partners who were IDUs (24.9% vs 12.5%). Consistent condom use with regular or non-regular partners was low (between 18.9% and 47.2%) regardless of the mixing pattern. However, parenteral risk for HIV transmission was relatively low in both groups. Conclusions: The transition of the HIV epidemic in China from injection drug use to sexual contact may be attributed to disassortative mixing in drug-use and sexual networks. HIV programs should consider disassortative mixing patterns when designing new behavioural interventions. (C) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling Departure Time Choice Under Stochastic Networks Involved in Network Design	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												Different travel cost functions for modeling travelers' departure time and route choice behavior under uncertainty are investigated; then the principal equivalency of the mean-variance and scheduling approaches in modeling departure time choice is proven analytically. Based on the equivalency, a general cost function is formulated for modeling travelers' departure time and route choice behavior under uncertainty and applied to an analysis of the departure patterns under uncertainty and a reliability-based dynamic network design problem. The analytical investigation of the departure pattern considering travel time reliability in the individual's travel cost function is presented as an extension of Vickrey's deterministic bottleneck model toward stochastic capacities. The departure pattern is significantly different from that without reliability: travelers depart earlier to reduce travel time variability. This finding (corroborated by simulations) motivated the network design approach including travel time reliability in departure time and route choice behavior. A discrete dynamic network design problem is formulated subject to a reliability-based dynamic user equilibrium, with the cost function derived from the equivalency analysis among different cost functions. Total network costs-the costs of total travel (including travel time reliability) and construction-are minimized. The network design problem consists of optimally allocating link capacities by determining the optimal numbers of lanes for a subset or a full set of links of a potential network. A genetic algorithm with some intelligence is adopted to solve the discrete optimization problem. Use of a small hypothetical network indicates that different network designs may lead to diverse departure distributions among different origin-destination (O-D) pairs over time, directly affecting travel costs. Relatively dissimilar departure patterns among different O-D pairs over time give lower travel costs.

We use the phrase "mixed scale-free networks" for networks where some communities have node degree that follows a power law similar to scale-free networks, while some have node degree that follows normal distribution. In this type of network, community detection algorithms that are designed for scale-free networks will have reduced accuracy because some communities do not have scale-free properties. On the other hand, algorithms that are not designed for scale-free networks will also have reduced accuracy because some communities have scale-free properties. To solve this problem, our algorithm consists of two community detection steps; one is aimed at extracting communities whose node degree follows power law distribution (scale-free), while the other one is aimed at extracting communities whose node degree follows normal distribution (non scale-free). To evaluate our method, we use NMI - Normalized Mutual Information - to measure our results on both synthetic and real-world datasets comparing with both scale-free and non scale-free community detection methods. The results show that our method outperforms all other based line methods on mixed scale-free networks.																			0218-2130	1793-6349				APR	2015	24	2			SI				1540007	10.1142/S0218213015400072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218213015400072													WOS:000352909400004

Local and Networked Mean-square Estimation with High Dimensional Log-concave Noise	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY					55th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 12-14, 2016	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE, Soc Ind & Appl Math, Inst Operat Res & Management Sci, Japanese Soc Instrument Control Engineers, European Control Assoc				We consider the problem of mean-square estimation of the state of a discrete time dynamical system having additive non-Gaussian noise. We assume that the noise has the structure that at each time instant, it is a projection of a fixed high-dimensional noise vector with a log-concave density. We derive conditions which guarantee that, as the dimension of this noise vector grows large, the optimal estimator of the problem with Gaussian noise becomes near-optimal for the problem with non-Gaussian noise. The results are derived by first showing an asymptotic Gaussian lower bound on the minimum error which holds even for nonlinear systems. The bound is asymptotically tight for linear systems. For nonlinear systems, this bound is tight provided and the noise has a strongly log-concave density with some additional structure. These results imply that the estimate obtained by employing the Gaussian estimator on the non-Gaussian problem satisfies an approximate orthogonality principle, and the difference between this estimate and the optimal estimate vanishes strongly in L-2. For linear systems with high-dimensional log-concave noise of this structure, we get that the Kalman filter serves as a near-optimal estimator. A key ingredient in the proofs is a recent central limit theorem of Eldan and Klartag. The minimum mean-square error is in general neither weakly upper semicontinuous nor weakly lower semicontinuous. Our results show that in the setting we consider, it is weakly continuous. We then consider mean-square estimation over a noisy network, where the problem is to jointly design strategies for sensing and estimation to minimize a composite quadratic cost. These problems do not have a static information structure, whereby the previously derived results do not apply. We consider two different cases-when the estimation part of the problem corresponds to estimating the original source sensed by the sensor, and when this part corresponds to the estimation of the action of the sensor.

The continuous increase in urban population and scale makes the factors considered in the urban route network design increasingly complex. Contemporary public transportation network design problems are based more on efficiency goals such as the accessibility and comfort of the transportation network, which increases the difficulty of analyzing the problem. Bus network design is not only an NP-hard (nondeterministic polynomial) problem but also a multivariable and multiobjective problem. This paper focuses on the bivariate and multiobjective bus network design problem of route generation and station selection. This paper proposes an algorithm called the Pseudo Force Field. By combining the idea of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the properties of the force field, a feasible route generation scheme is provided for the design of the bus network. The algorithm does not need to determine the end station and has a high degree of completion of the demand. This solves the problem of the selection of terminal stations in large-scale road network design. On this basis, the article combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Pareto frontier to provide a new route optimization algorithm and proves the effectiveness of the algorithm. The model has achieved theoretical results in the design of the bus route network in the megacity of Shenzhen, China.

Novel distributed consensus protocols with and without communication delay are designed. Based on the analysis of error dynamical system and graph theory, the generalized consensus is globally asymptotically achieved under suitable conditions without changing the zero row-sums property of Laplacian matrix in networks. Moreover, the sufficient conditions for generalized consensus of communication delay are obtained under directed connections.

The robot control law is composed of the dynamic inversion of the DNN system, adaptive compensation and the NN variable structure control (VSC) components.

This paper studies the technology of integrating mixed-criticality avionics traffics for Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) network, which can transmit both critical and non-critical traffics. These two traffics have different QoS requirements, such as low latency for critical traffics and high bandwidth for non-critical traffics. We use system-level compositional scheduling to integrate mixed-criticality traffics into one network to enhance the scalability of AFDX network. In the architecture of the proposed compositional scheduling, critical traffics are scheduled by bandwidth allocation gap-based scheduler, and non-critical traffics by Round Robin manner. To estimate the delay bound meeting requirements of applications, end-to-end delay for both critical and non-critical traffics are analyzed by using network calculus. Finally, a true time-based simulation of AFDX networks is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.																			2169-3536						2016	4						5880	5888		10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2584859	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2584859													WOS:000386078300027

The agent subsystems are connected by lossy channels, which can be described by Markov process. The relationship of agent dynamics, communication network, and packet losses rate is studied, and based on which the MASs can achieve consensus by a designed distributed controller. Specifically, based on the stability of a transformed system state function under the identical packet looses, we first derive the sufficient condition of consensus for discrete-time MASs, and meanwhile design the control gain. Then, we also discuss the sufficient condition of consensus for the MASs under nonidentical packet losses. At last, the availability of the proposed results is illustrated through simulation examples.

To solve the noncausal problem in control design, the system is transformed by future outputs prediction. The difficulty of nonaffine appearance of the control input is overcome by exploiting of implicit function theorem. The lack of a priori knowledge on the control directions is solved by using discrete Nussbaum gain. The high-order-neural-network (HONN) is employed to approximate the unknown ideal control. The closed-loop system achieves semi-global-uniformly-ultimately-boundedness (SGUUB) stability and the output tracking error is made within a small neighborhood around zero by suitably choosing the design parameters. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.

This study examines a new problem, which is a reliability-based continuous network design problem under cost recovery. In this problem, the variations of system travel time and path travel times, the risk attitudes of the system manager and travelers, congestion toll charges, capacity expansions, and cost recovery constraint are explicitly considered. The design problem is formulated as a min-max problem with the reliability-based user equilibrium constraint. It is proved that the price of anarchy for this problem is bounded above, and the upper bound is independent of travel time functions, demands, and network topology. The upper bound is related to the travel time variations, the value of reliability, and the value of time.

Such frameworks should address mixed-criticality in both computation and NoC communication. In Mixed-Critical (MC) systems, only the Safety-Critical (SC) parts have strict predictability and dependability requirements, but conventional methods design the whole system with pessimistic settings to ensure these requirements are satisfied. This however, results in under-utilization of computation and network resources, and a decrease in performance. In this work, we integrate support of MC applications into an existing system-level design framework of dependable NoC-based multiprocessors. This framework handles failures in both computation and inter-task communication. We address the under-utilization problem by proposing a mixed-critical scheduling method such that the overall system performance is increased but all deadlines of SC tasks are met even in the presence of transient faults. Our approach handles mixed-criticality not only in tasks but also in inter-task messages. Our experiments demonstrate performance improvement in different run-time execution environments and with different MC benchmark applications including a realistic robot control system. Performance improvement is achieved regardless of task graph size, NoC size or temporal redundancy level.

The line attractor is one-dimensional continuous attractor, while the twodimensional continuous attractor is called plane attractor. The weight matrix and the external input play the key role for the expression of the continuous attractor. In this paper, some conditions for the parameter selection to achieve line attractor and plane attractor are given. we see that even a pretty small perturbation of the parameter may heavily affect the type and shape of the continuous attractor. The parameter selection scheme is crucial for designing the neural network model. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

These sites have therefore become key for information sharing. Particularly, academics and researchers have adopted them for networking and collaborations. This study seeks to investigate how embedded persuasive features on social networking sites designed for academics and researchers affect continuous use intention. The study adopted an existing model for assessing the effectiveness of persuasive features on systems and sampled 416 participants who are engaged in academic research and analyzed their responses. The results indicate that Social Support, Computer-Human Dialogue Support and Primary Task Support significantly impact how users perceive social networking sites designed for effective academic work. Contrary to existing knowledge that Perceived Credibility, Perceived Effectiveness, Perceived Effort and Perceived Social Support all impact an individual's Intention to Continuous Use of a system, only Perceived Credibility was observed to impact Intention to Use continuously. The findings also proved that affective ties and mutual support on academic social networking sites influence behaviour.

One of difficulties to use the network is how to design the structure of the network. There are some approaches to improve this difficulty. An approach is structural learning algorithms based on BP and its object function is required to be continuous and differentiable. Another way is genetic algorithm (GA) which is good at search of large space and it is not necessary for the fitness function to be continuous and differentiable. The purpose of this paper is to design the structure of three layered neural network with GA for the real world task. We propose a new coding method and fitness function. The proposed method is applied to an acoustic diagnosis. The results show that the proposed method is effective for designing the structure of the network.																					4-274-90259-5				1998							995	998																WOS:000079630400226

Sometimes it is worth more attention, especially when individuals are represented. Visually translating communities in networks, for example, implies that some individuals are always situated at the borders of the representation. This assumption is clearly unfair, especially if each individual of the community is connected with everybody else. To solve this lack of design justice, the community is represented on a spherical network where the surface is continuous.

Philip; Li, Xuelong			Complex Network Optimization for Fixed-Time Continuous Action Iteration Dilemma by Using Reinforcement Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												In this paper, an optimization algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to optimize complex networks in fixed-time convergence of continuous action iteration dilemmas. The field of continuous action iterative dilemmas has long been studied, with prior research primarily emphasizing the effectiveness of strategy selection and the stability of strategy evolution. However, the impact of topology on strategy evolution has remained under-explored. The present study fills this gap by examining how the structure of complex networks influences the time required for players to reach Nash Equilibrium and overall payoff. To identify the optimal complex network that ensures fixed-time convergence of continuous action iteration dilemma, achieves the shortest time, and attains the highest overall payoff in the Nash Equilibrium state, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to optimize the complex network. Firstly, the paper applies the Lyapunov stability theory to analyze the convergence of the fixed-time continuous action iteration dilemma and compute the upper bound of convergence time. Secondly, based on the fixed-time convergence of continuous action iteration dilemma, we establish evaluation criteria based on the time taken by players to reach the Nash Equilibrium and the overall payoff, subsequently designing evaluation functions for complex networks utilizing these criteria. Thirdly, this paper applies a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to resolve the optimization issue associated with the proposed evaluation function, while analyzing the convergence of complex network optimization methods. Lastly, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulating the dynamic model of snowdrift games and prisoner dilemmas.						yu, dengxiu/0000-0003-1803-3946													2327-4697					JUL-AUG	2024	11	4					3771	3781		10.1109/TNSE.2024.3384509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNSE.2024.3384509													WOS:001246574800031

First, a fuzzy nonlinear networked control system model is established by interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model, the designed non-fragile filter resolves the filter parameter uncertainties and uses different membership functions from the IT2 T-S fuzzy model. Second, a novel mixed time/event-triggered transmission mechanism is proposed, which decreases the waste of network resources. Next, Bernoulli random variables are used to describe the cases of random switching mixed time/event-triggered transmission mechanism.

The WTODP is utilized to mitigate unnecessary network congestion occurring in the channel between DMNNs and the state estimator. In order to ensure resilience against possible realization errors, the estimator gain is permitted to undergo some norm-bounded parameter drifts. Our objective is to design a resilient set-membership estimator (RSME) that is capable of resisting gain variations and unknown-but-bounded noises by confining the estimation error to certain ellipsoidal regions. By resorting to the recursive matrix inequality technique, sufficient conditions are acquired for the existence of the expected RSME and, subsequently, an optimization problem is formalized by minimizing the constraint ellipsoid (with respect to the estimation error) under WTODP. Finally, numerical simulation is carried out to validate the usefulness of RSME.

Since in industrial applications it is a common practice to apply digital controllers, in particular in networked environment, the design is performed with explicit consideration of finite sampling rate. Discrete sliding-mode control is proposed with sliding hyperplane providing delay compensating features. The plane parameters are selected for dead-beat response, and the control law is synthesized in easy-to-implement closed form. In order to satisfy input constraints (e.g. mass downward motion restricted by gravity constant), a time-varying hyperplane is introduced. The proposed control strategy provides fast error elimination without overshoots and oscillations.

The high order discrete-time robot model is transformed to facilitate digital implementation of controller, and the output-feedback form is derived to avoid potential noncausal problem in discrete time. Furthermore, the desired controller based on RBFNN is designed to compensate for effect of uncertainties, and the RBFNN is trained using tracking error, such that the stability of closed loop robot system has been well guaranteed, the high-quality control performance has been well satisfied. The RBFNN weight adaptive law is designed and the semi-global uniformly ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) is achieved by Lyapunov based on control synthesis.

Conventional high/low-pass networks are widely applied in 22.5 degrees-90 degrees phase shifters. However, the tradeoff must be made between the bandwidths of return loss and phase error, which are limited to less than 90%. The proposed bridged T-type bandpass network can improve the bandwidth of phase error while keeping good return loss. Theoretically, the fractional bandwidth of a phase shifter using a bridged T-type bandpass network can be improved by more than 40 percentage points as compared with a conventional high-pass network. 22.5 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees phase shifters are demonstrated on FR4 using discrete surface mounted device (SMD) L/C components. Due to limited discrete SMD component values, the phase and return-loss bandwidths of the realized three phase shifters are slightly reduced, but still larger than 125% and are better than 18 dB from 0.55 to 2.51 GHz.

J	Wang, XH; Liu, P; Yang, M; Jiang, YT				Wang, Xiaohang; Liu, Peng; Yang, Mei; Jiang, Yingtao			Avoiding request-request type message-dependent deadlocks in networks-on-chips	PARALLEL COMPUTING												When an application is running on a network-on-chip (NoC)-based multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC), two types of deadlocks may occur: (i) the routing-dependent deadlocks, and (ii) the message-dependent deadlocks. The former type of deadlocks can be avoided by removing any cyclic paths on the application's channel dependency graph. The message-dependent deadlocks, caused by mutual dependency of different control and/or data messages, on the other hand, are very complicated to deal with. In this paper, we focus our study on the request-request type message-dependent deadlocks which may appear in a peer-to-peer streaming system. This type of deadlocks can have devastating effects on applications using streaming protocols that often demands real-time processing over continuous data streams. We show that request-request type of deadlocks can be avoided by proper inclusion of virtual channels (VCs) for the links along the selected routing path. These VCs are not bounded to a particular communication path. Instead, they can be shared among multiple existing communication flows. In this paper, we have formally proved a sufficient condition that determines the minimum number of VCs actually needed for each link of a communication flow such that, request-request type message-dependent deadlocks can be completely avoided. Following this sufficient condition, we propose a path selection and minimum VC allocation (PSMV) algorithm to help determine the minimum number of non-uniform VCs for each link. The PSMV algorithm consists of two major steps. In the first step, we attempt to minimize the maximum number of VCs among all the links. This problem is NP-complete in nature, and it is solved using the proposed mixed integral linear programming (MILP)-based algorithm. In the second step, based on the solution suggested in the first step, the minimum number of VCs for each link is finally determined. The PSMV algorithm can literally be integrated with any existing application mapping algorithm to provide deadlock-free mapping results. One such deadlock-free mapping algorithm is suggested in this paper. Our experiments also show that, compared to an existing flow control based deadlock avoidance method (CTC) and a deadlock recovery method (DR), increase of buffers size in PSMV is within 5% compared to a baseline network configuration. The message latency of PSMV is the lowest among all three designs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thirdly, by choosing an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and using some effective summation inequalities, two less conservative conditions are derived to guarantee the desired stability, in which the co-designs on AETM parameter and controller gain are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

It is preferable to minimize the number of sensors which can still cover the entire indoor space with a balanced load. However, this multi-objective problem is quite complex in practice. In this work, we will study this critical multisensor placement problem mathematically and algorithmically and propose a systematic approach to tackle this problem. In this paper, we focus on the line-of-sight (LoS) coverage within a rectilinear indoor environment and the sensors' locations are restricted on the perimeter. Our proposed new approach consists of two stages. First, a partitioning algorithm is designed to partition an arbitrary rectilinear geometry into a number (as few as possible) of feasible rectilinear subareas, each of which can be fully covered by a sensor located somewhere on its external perimeter. Second, the average squared Euclidean distance from a sensor to an arbitrary point within its coverage area is taken as an additional objective measure. By minimizing such average squared Euclidean distance, one can find the optimal sensor location. In our new approach, the first stage is related to solving the art gallery problem (AGP) based on discrete optimization while the second stage is based on continuous optimization. Therefore, our proposed new approach involves both continuous and discrete optimization schemes. By simulations, we also show that the number of sensors placed by our new algorithm is equal to or less than the theoretical upper-bound established in the existing AGP study for numerous rectilinear geometries. Moreover, we also show that by minimizing the average squared Euclidean distance, we maximize the average received signal strength indoors using the prevalent Feko wireless-channel emulator. Our proposed new systematic approach can also deal with practical scenarios involving internal obstacle(s) and sensing-range restriction.

A novel concept of bounded H-infinity synchronization is proposed to handle the time-varying nature of the complex networks. Such a concept captures the transient behavior of the time-varying complex network over a finite horizon, where the degree of bounded synchronization is quantified in terms of the H-infinity-norm. A general sector-like nonlinear function is employed to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. By utilizing a time-varying real-valued function and the Kronecker product, criteria are established that ensure the bounded H-infinity synchronization in terms of a set of recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs), where the RLMIs can be computed recursively by employing available MATLAB toolboxes. The bounded H-infinity state estimation problem is then studied for the same complex network, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that, over a finite horizon, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be bounded with a given disturbance attenuation level. Again, an RLMI approach is developed for the state estimation problem. Finally, two simulation examples are exploited to show the effectiveness of the results derived in this paper.					沈, 国/L-5652-2014; Wang, Zidong/H-1523-2011; Liu, Xiaohui/B-5046-2013	Wang, Zidong/0000-0002-9576-7401; 													1045-9227	1941-0093				JAN	2011	22	1					145	157		10.1109/TNN.2010.2090669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2090669								21095865					WOS:000286010000013

The majority of the models are implemented at the reduced resolution, leading to unfavorable results at the full resolution. Moreover, the complicated relationship between MS and panchromatic (PAN) images is often ignored in detail injection. For the mentioned problems, unsupervised generative adversarial networks with recursive mixed-scale feature fusion for pansharpening (RMFF-UPGAN) are modeled to boost the spatial resolution and preserve the spectral information. RMFF-UPGAN comprises a generator and two U-shaped discriminators. A dual-stream trapezoidal branch is designed in the generator to obtain multiscale information. Further, a recursive mixed-scale feature fusion subnetwork is designed. Perform a prior fusion on the extracted MS and PAN features of the same scale. A mixed-scale fusion is conducted on the prior fusion results of the fine scale and coarse scale. The fusion is executed sequentially in the aforementioned manner building a recursive mixed-scale fusion structure, and finally, generating key information. A compensation information mechanism is also designed for the reconstruction of key information to compensate for information. A nonlinear rectification block for the reconstructed information is developed to overcome the distortion induced by neglecting the complicated relationship between MS and PAN images. Two U-shaped discriminators are designed and a new composite loss function is defined. The presented model is validated using two satellite data and the outcomes reveal better than the prevalent approaches regarding both visual assessment and objective indicators.

The spread of COVID-19 has seriously affected the normal order in the transportation sector. With the increase in the number of infected people and the government's anti-epidemic policy, human outgoing activities have gradually decreased, resulting in increasingly obvious discreteness and irregularities in traffic flow data. This article proposes a deep-space time traffic flow prediction model based on discrete wavelet transform (DSTM-DWT) to overcome the highly discrete and irregular nature of the new crown epidemic. First, DSTM-DWT decomposes traffic flow into discrete attributes, such as flow trend, discrete amplitude, and discrete baseline. Second, we design the spatial relationship of the transportation network as a graph and integrate the new crown pneumonia epidemic data into the characteristics of each transportation node. Then, we use the graph convolutional network to calculate the spatial correlation of each node, and the temporal convolutional network to calculate the temporal correlation of the data. In order to solve the problem of high discreteness of traffic flow data during the epidemic, this article proposes a graph memory network (GMN), which is used to convert discrete magnitudes separated by discrete wavelet transform into highdimensional discrete features. Finally, use DWT to segment the predicted traffic data, and then perform the inverse discrete wavelet transform between the newly segmented traffic trend and discrete baseline and the discrete model predicted by GMN to obtain the final traffic flow prediction result. In simulation experiments, this work was compared with the existing advanced baselines to verify the superiority of DSTM-DWT.

The parameter uncertainties are assumed to be norm-bounded and enter into both the network state and the network output. The stochastic Brownian motions affect not only the coupling term of the network but also the overall network dynamics. The nonlinear terms that satisfy the usual Lipschitz conditions exist in both the state and measurement equations. Through available output measurements described by a binary switching sequence that obeys a conditional probability distribution, we aim to design a state estimator to estimate the network states such that, for all admissible parameter uncertainties and time-varying delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be globally exponentially stable in the mean square. By employing the Lyapunov functional method combined with the stochastic analysis approach, several delay-dependent criteria are established that ensure the existence of the desired estimator gains, and then the explicit expression of such estimator gains is characterized in terms of the solution to certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Two numerical examples are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator design schemes.

Event-triggered Discrete-time Sliding Mode Control for High-order Systems via Reduced-order Model Approach	IFAC PAPERSONLINE					21st IFAC World Congress on Automatic Control - Meeting Societal Challenges	JUL 11-17, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Int Federat Automat Control, Siemens, Bayer, ABB, MathWorks, Phoenix Contact, Ifak Technol, Berlin Heart, Elsevier, De Gruyter, Tele Medi GmbH				We propose the design of event-triggered (ET) discrete-time sliding mode (DTSM) control for a high-order discrete-time system via a reduced-order model-based approach. This design includes a triggering mechanism using a reduced-order state vector and a controller based on the modified Bartoszewicz' reaching law for a reduced-order model of the system, to stabilize the uncertain high-order system. The main advantages of using a reduced-order vector in the event condition are the low-order synthesis of the controller and the sampling pattern, which may be sparser than the full vector-based design. This motivation arises from the fact that relaxing a few components of the state vector in the triggering mechanism may decrease its rate of violation. An added advantage of the proposal is that the transmission of the reduced-order vector, particularly in a network-based implementation, can outperform the full-order based design due to the severe challenges that exist in the data network. The robust performance for the closed-loop system is achieved using the DTSM control. We show that our proposal guarantees the stability of the full-order plant with the reduced-order triggering mechanism. The control execution is Zeno-free because of the inherent discrete nature of the control. The efficiency of the proposed method is shown using the simulation results of a numerical example.

A novel approach to district heating and cooling network design based on life cycle cost optimization	ENERGY												Piping layout, material, and dimension choices are essential in determining the initial capital costs and full operating costs of a district heating and cooling (DHC) network. While common practice aims to minimize initial capital costs or, in some cases, operational costs, this paper introduces a novel method for designing DHC network layouts for minimum total life-cycle cost by introducing additional engineering design parameters related to pipe sizing, heat losses, and pumping energy. The proposed mixed integer linear programming solution satisfies the thermal and hydraulic constraints on the network while minimizing the objective function of total cost over the lifetime of the network. The method is tested with three case studies. Results show improvement in reducing total life-cycle costs of the network compared to approaches that consider only capital or operating costs and exclude network dimensioning.

W.; Zhu, Chengjuan; Wu, Jianjun			The combination of continuous network design and route guidance	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												In this study, a traffic management measure is presented by combining the route guidance of Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) and the continuous network design (CNDP) to alleviate increasing traffic congestion. The route guidance recommends the travelers to choose the shortest path based on marginal travel cost and user constraints. The problem is formulated into a bi-level programming problem. The most distinct property of this problem formulation is that the feasible path set of its lower-level problem is determined by the decision variable of upper-level problem, while in conventional transportation network design problems the feasible path set for lower-level traffic assignment problem is fixed to be all the viable paths between each specific origin-destination pair. The simulated annealing algorithm is improved to solve this bi-level problem. A path-based traffic algorithm is developed to calculate the lower-level traffic assignment problem under the route guidance. Compared to the results of conventional CNDP, the measure presented in this study can better improve the transportation network performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To comply with the discrete nature of networked systems, in contrast to most of the existing work for MASs under network imperfections, the agents are modeled by discrete-time dynamics. The communication network is considered to be undirected, its delay is considered to be time-varying but bounded, and its packet dropout is modeled by a Bernoulli distributed white sequence. Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for asymptotic mean-square consensus stability are derived under network imperfections without considering external disturbances. A desired disturbance attenuation level in the presence of both external disturbances and network imperfections is also provided. A simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in coping with network imperfection and disturbances.																			2329-9266	2329-9274				MAY	2019	6	3					667	675		10.1109/JAS.2019.1911474	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JAS.2019.1911474													WOS:000467567300006

Modeling Large-Scale Slim Fly Networks Using Parallel Discrete-Event Simulation	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MODELING AND COMPUTER SIMULATION												As supercomputers approach exascale performance, the increased number of processors translates to an increased demand on the underlying network interconnect. The slim fly network topology, a new low-diameter, low-latency, and low-cost interconnection network, is gaining interest as one possible solution for next-generation supercomputing interconnect systems. In this article, we present a high-fidelity slim fly packet-level model leveraging the Rensselaer Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS) and Co-Design of Exascale Storage (CODES) frameworks. We validate the model with published work before scaling the network size up to an unprecedented 1 million compute nodes and confirming that the slim fly observes peak network throughput at extreme scale. In addition to synthetic workloads, we evaluate large-scale slim fly models with real communication workloads from applications in the Design Forward program with over 110,000 MPI processes. We show strong scaling of the slim fly model on an Intel cluster achieving a peak network packet transfer rate of 2.3 million packets per second and processing over 7 billion discrete events using 128 MPI tasks. Enabled by the strong performance capabilities of the model, we perform a detailed application trace and routing protocol performance study. Through analysis of metrics such as packet latency, hop count, and congestion, we find that the slim fly network is able to leverage simple minimal routing and achieve the same performance as more complex adaptive routing for tested DOE benchmark applications.

However, the accuracies of these methods would be seriously influenced by particle agglomeration and imprecise feature design. In the work, the convolutional neural network (CNN) was introduced to extract the particle features in the image, where the particle localizations were obtained by implementing the region proposal network (RPN). Meanwhile, the particle segmentation at pixel level was achieved by a developed classifier and a fully convolutional network. A series of experiments were performed to a flowing mixed particle system consisting of spherical, elongated and irregular particles, and it showed that both the average accuracy and recall rate of SVM method were up to 87% with artificial feature design, while they were increased to 97% and 93% with CNN, respectively. For the median diameter (Dn(50)) of irregular particles, the latter method can also reduce the analysis error by more than 11%. It revealed that some shortages like imprecise feature design in traditional methods can be covered, and an end-to-end classified system can be formed to provide a more effective way for online analysis of flowing mixed particles.

This system, named CIPROS, uses a modular representation to create discrete-event simulation networks, and to aid in relating simulation output back to the design and construction plan of a facility to be built. CIPROS users must identify and describe attributes of components to be constructed, based on the facility's design drawings and specifications, and they must develop a critical path method (CPM) plan. They must also select a construction method to perform each activity by retrieving the appropriate elemental simulation network from a library of networks that represent such methods. CIPROS then pieces together the networks based on sequential relationships from the plan and property values input from the drawing and specification data. The latter initialize the simulation network resources that make up the constructed facility. To complete the simulation network, users must specify the construction resources that are available to perform the work and which may be shared by activities. CIPROS comprises a fully operational discrete-event simulation engine that is called once a network is completed. Besides producing statistical reports that are instrumental in assessing the quality of the construction plan, CIPROS can also be used to check the degree of facility completion as the simulation progresses.

However, challenges exist in designing a supporting network with optimal resource management while achieving quality-of-experience for a smart service. In this article, we propose a unified SA-WMN architecture that can be applied to different smart services. The core of the SA-WMN architecture is a smart service-aware network controller. The mega network controller has a service adaptation module, network cognition module and resource provisioning module that can achieve cost-effective wireless-mixed area network deployment, and efficient network resource management of SA-WMN. The proposed SA-WMN architecture is expected to close the gap on wireless network design, improve energy efficiency and enhance spectrum efficiency and access, in a smart service-aware paradigm. It will pave the way for realizing next-generation wireless network based smart services.					qian, yi/HZH-4175-2023; Zhang, Xiaoxi/KBP-8753-2024; Qian, Yi/KEI-0952-2024														0890-8044	1558-156X				JAN-FEB	2019	33	1					84	91		10.1109/MNET.2018.1700399	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2018.1700399													WOS:000456170800014

Models and simulations allowed to study the immune system behavior, to test biological hypotheses about diseases and infection dynamics, and to improve and optimize novel and existing drugs and vaccines. Continuous models, mainly based on differential equations, usually allow to qualitatively study the system but lack in description; conversely discrete models, such as agent based models and cellular automata, permit to describe in detail entities properties at the cost of losing most qualitative analyses. Petri Nets (PN) are a graphical modeling tool developed to model concurrency and synchronization in distributed systems. Their use has become increasingly marked also thanks to the introduction in the years of many features and extensions which lead to the born of "high level" PN. Results: We propose a novel methodological approach that is based on high level PN, and in particular on Colored Petri Nets (CPN), that can be used to model the immune system response at the cellular scale. To demonstrate the potentiality of the approach we provide a simple model of the humoral immune system response that is able of reproducing some of the most complex well-known features of the adaptive response like memory and specificity features. Conclusions: The methodology we present has advantages of both the two classical approaches based on continuous and discrete models, since it allows to gain good level of granularity in the description of cells behavior without losing the possibility of having a qualitative analysis. Furthermore, the presented methodology based on CPN allows the adoption of the same graphical modeling technique well known to life scientists that use PN for the modeling of signaling pathways. Finally, such an approach may open the floodgates to the realization of multi scale models that integrate both signaling pathways (intra cellular) models and cellular (population) models built upon the same technique and software.

Various approaches exist, yet none is taking advantage of the diversity of available solutions to offer a higher anonymity. This paper introduces a generic framework, a higher level host network architecture, that allows mixture of various communication protocols. Our proposal can be gradually adopted by the existing networks. Obtained results include a potentially higher anonymity for all guest networks, and a pathway towards sharing user-bases, mixing the low- and high-latency communication, and benefiting from security-by-obscurity. As a result of mixing various protocols, some level of network unobservability will be achieved.

Design and implementation of multipattern generators in analog VLSI	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS												In recent years, computational biologists have shown through simulation that small neural networks with fixed connectivity are capable of producing multiple output rhythms in response to transient inputs. It is believed that such networks may play a key role in certain biological behaviors such as dynamic gait control. In this paper, we present a novel method for designing continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) that contain multiple embedded limit cycles, and we show that it is possible to switch the networks between these embedded limit cycles with simple transient inputs. We also describe the design and testing of a fully integrated four-neuron CTRNN chip that is used to implement the neural network pattern generators. We provide two example multipattern generators and show that the measured waveforms from the chip agree well with numerical simulations.																			1045-9227	1941-0093				JUL	2006	17	4					1025	1038		10.1109/TNN.2006.875983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2006.875983								16856664					WOS:000238865200016

In order to improve the classification accuracy, we design a mixed attention dense network for sketch classification. According to the sparse characteristics of the sketch, this network uses overlapping pooling of a large size. In addition, dense blocks are added on the top of the middle convolutional layers to achieve feature reuse. Specifically, in order to extract more representative local, detail information, mixed attention is applied in the dense blocks. Finally, the center loss is combined with the softmax cross entropy loss to improve the classification accuracy. Through experiments, we compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods on the TU-Berlin dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.					zhu, ming/ABI-2777-2020														0924-669X	1573-7497				OCT	2021	51	10					7298	7305		10.1007/s10489-021-02211-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-021-02211-x		MAR 2021											WOS:000625524900003

The proposed technique design incorporates long short-term memory neural networks (LSTMs) and fuzzy neural networks (FNNs). To be more precise, LSTMs are utilized to adjust vital parameters of the FFMFAC online. Additionally, due to the high nonlinear approximation capabilities of FNNs, pseudo gradient (PG) values of the controller are estimated online. EFFMFAC is characterized by utilizing the measured I/O data for the online training of all introduced neural networks and does not involve offline training and specific models of the controlled system. Finally, the rationality and superiority are verified by two simulations and a supporting ablation analysis. Five individual performance indices are given, and the experimental findings show that EFFMFAC outperforms all other methods. Especially compared with the FFMFAC, EFFMFAC reduces the RMSE by 21.69% and 11.21%, respectively, proving it to be applicable for SISO discrete-time nonlinear systems.

Based on adaptive dynamic programming ( ADP) and adaptive critic designs (ACDs), the optimal control of nonlinear system theory has been intensive studied. However, based on neural network, the ADP still have the problem of network structure design and learning parameters optimization. Because the kernel function can reflect the similarity among data by the form of inner product of data, the traditional linear learning algorithm can be extended to nonlinear theoretical framework by kernel function. Based on online kernel learning, the kernel-based adaptive critic designs is studied in this paper. Then, the critic of ADP is designed by using the kernel recursive least square algorithm. Thus, the realization process of the KHDP and KDHP algorithms are obtained. Finally, example and computer simulation are shown that the kernel-based ACDs can effectively solve the optimal control of nonlinear discrete-time system.																			2161-2927		978-9-8815-6395-8				2018							2167	2172																WOS:000468622102039

Based on a social network analysis of policy documents we find that as the e-mobility transition unfolds, a complex and evolving network of governing entities has appeared in designing China's EV policy mix. Specifically, a small group of highly interactive governing entities has played a critical role in coordinating and mobilising system resources, while some new entrants have also come to the fore in response to recent socio-technical changes. Moreover, our community detection analysis distinguishes various groups of governing entities, each performing different policy functions. Based on our empirical case, we discuss factors that influence changes to administrative arrangements for policy mixes. We conclude that the deliberate acceleration of sustainability transitions calls for further research on the administration of the associated policy mixes.

Artificial neural networks appeared to be a plausible alternative to get a non-parametric representation of the aforementioned interconnected systems. The modelling strategy used a set of spatial distributed second-order continuous neural networks (CNN). Each node in the interconnected system was represented as a second-order continuous neural network added by the super-twisting discontinuous sliding mode algorithm. The non-parametric modelling problem was reduced to design a feasible expression for the CNN weights in order to reproduce the states (including the generalized derivative of position vector) of all the nodes dynamics together and simultaneously. The adaptive laws for the CNN weights ensured the convergence of the CNN trajectories to the states of the uncertain interconnected system. To investigate the qualitative behaviour of the suggested methodology, two numerical examples were proposed. The first one represents the interconnection of three mass-spring-damper mechanical systems. The second example considers the problem of the non-parametric modelling problem for a wave partial differential equation. A set of three-dimensional graphic representations were used to demonstrate the identification abilities achieved by the CNN designed in this study for the second case.

Compared with the conventional event -triggered mechanism (ETM) with constant threshold, a novel resilient ETM is designed to withstand the affect of denial -of -service attacks and conserve communication resources. Different from the energy -bounded deception attacks, an unknown state -dependent nonlinear attack signal is considered in this work. To identify the deception attack, the NN technique is utilized to approximate the unknown attack signal. Subsequently, an adaptive controller is established to compensate for the malicious affects of deception attacks on the system. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the system are derived via applying the Lyapunov functional, and a co -design strategy for control gain and event -triggering parameter is provided.

The studied network consists of collaborative suppliers who satisfy their customers' needs by delivering their products through common platforms. Several parameters-namely, demands, unit transportation costs, the maximum number of vehicles in use, etc.-are subject to interval uncertainty. Mixed-integer linear programming formulations are presented for each of these cases, in which the economic and environmental dimensions of the sustainability are studied and applied to minimise the logistical costs and the CO2 emissions, respectively. These formulations are solved using CPLEX. In this study, we propose a case study of a distribution network in France to validate our models.

However, for network security and to provide guaranteed communications, it would still be desirable to ensure that a certain fraction of the bandwidth is assured through routers which cannot be put to sleep using software control. This paper presents an energy-minimized IP over WDM network using a mixture of sleep-enabled and non-sleep-enabled router cards where a certain percentage of the network bandwidth is guaranteed to the offered traffic. Such a mixed configuration is also motivated by the fact that there will always be some traffic demand between each node pair at any time even though the traffic between node pairs may fluctuate to very low levels. This implies a need for some non-sleeping router cards at any time. Another motivation for this mixed configuration is because in the course of migration from today's networks with non-sleep-enabled cards to future networks with sleep-enabled cards, the non-sleep-enabled network devices will not be quickly abandoned but will be gradually replaced. This also causes a network situation with the mixed router card types. To design an IP over WDM network where both sleep-enabled and non-sleep-enabled router cards are used, we propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model which jointly minimizes the energy consumption of all the router cards while guaranteeing a secured fractional bandwidth for all the node pairs. Modified MILPs with subsequent port-channel association are also proposed along with efficient heuristic algorithms which perform almost as well as the joint MILP approaches. The performance of these approaches is studied through simulations on a wide variety of networks.

However, state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require vast resources that are limited on edge devices. This limitation has brought the need to design custom hardware to implement DL-specific optimizations. Traditionally DNNs have run on high-precision number formats; however, DNNs are surprisingly robust and do not require this much precision. Instead, using quantization, networks can run on low-bit widths while achieving fair accuracy. This finding suggests that edge devices can run resource-efficient DNNs at the cost of accuracy. In addition, layers within a network do not require the same precision. Therefore, a further optimization suggests using mixed-precision over uniform quantization. A comparison is made between an architecture-designed to support mixed-precision DNNs in hardware-and its single-precision counterpart.

State variables are estimated by Luenberger observer using latest outputs received in controller. The control signals, bearing the same time-stamps as the target system, are constructed based on DSC methodologies. The control mechanism also considers the network-induced time-varying delays, packet drops and disorder; these parameters are systematically stacked into the network and transmitted into an actuator where the control function is performed.

J	Eusuff, MM; Lansey, KE				Eusuff, MM; Lansey, KE			Optimization of water distribution network design using the Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) is a meta-heuristic for solving discrete optimization problems. Here it is applied to determine optimal discrete pipe sizes for new pipe networks and for network expansions. SFLA is a Population based, cooperative search metaphor inspired by natural memetics. The algorithm uses memetic evolution in the form of infection of ideas from one individual to another in a local search. The local search is similar in concept to particle swarm optimization. A shuffling strategy allows for the exchange of information between local searches to move toward a global optimum. This paper summarizes the development of SFLANET, a computer model that links SFLA and the hydraulic simulation software EPANET and its library functions. Application of SFLANET to literature network design problems is then described. Although the algorithm is in its initial stages of development, promising results were obtained.

A new systematic approach is proposed to eliminate the kink points and linearize the composite curves. This is based on a systematic strategy that indicates how to mix and split the water streams in order to modify the shape of the initial composite curves. A new graphical thermodynamic rule that avoids the deterioration of energy targets while minimizing the number of heat transfer units as well as the mixing and splitting network complexity has been formalized. This rule permits the control of the procedure of mixing and splitting on the T-H diagram in order to guarantee the pre-established targets. The proposed approach can be used for either the manual design of heat recovery within water networks or the building of a superstructure with a limited number of feasible design options.																			0145-7632	1521-0537				JUL-AUG	2004	25	5					30	38		10.1080/01457630490459120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01457630490459120													WOS:000221933800006

The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the networked control system under S-ALOHA protocol is described as a stochastic discrete linear time invariant system.

Recent works have underlined that a global measure to quantify node homophily necessarily provides a partial, often deceiving, picture of the reality. Moving from such literature, in this work, we propose a novel measure, namely Conformity, designed to overcome such limitation by providing a node-centric quantification of assortative mixing patterns. Different from the measures proposed so far, Conformity is designed to be path-aware, thus allowing for a more detailed evaluation of the impact that nodes at different degrees of separations have on the homophilic embeddedness of a target. Experimental analysis on synthetic and real data allowed us to observe that Conformity can unveil valuable insights from node-attributed graphs.

Initially, the replacement of 10 Gbps legacy equipment was considered. Nowadays, some works point out that the deployment of mixed line rate (MLR) networks, where 10 Gbps and higher bit rate Gbps channels share the same fiber, could be more cost effective than the total replacement of 10 Gbps systems. In this paper, we investigate the planning of 10/40 Gbps MLR networks using the ITU 50 GHz grid, considering nonlinear interferences between 10 and 40 Gbps channels, which degrade the quality of transmission. This approach is novel in the literature. In addition, we conduct a set of tests normalizing the length of fiber links, to observe the trends in MLR planning for different network sizes.

Different from existing results for FD, the proposed ones are toward closed-loop design problem, that is, the controller gain, and the fault detection filter (FDF) gains are designed simultaneously. The missing phenomenon is assumed to occur, in the communication links for quantizer-to-FDF and controller-to-physical plant, where the missing probability of packet dropouts is governed by an individual random binary distribution, while the quantization errors are treated as sector-bound uncertainties. The discrete-time fuzzy networked system is first transformed into the form of interconnection of two subsystems by applying an input output method and a two-term approximation approach, which is employed to approximate the time-varying delay. Our attention is focused on the design of fuzzy fault detection filter (FFDF) such that, for all data missing conditions, and measurement quantization, the residual system is stochastically stable with a guaranteed H-infinity performance. Sufficient conditions are first established via introducing some slack matrices to facilitate the FDF design procedure by eliminating the coupling between the Lyapunov matrices and the system matrices. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bernardi, L				Bernardi, Laura			A Mixed-Methods Social Networks Study Design for Research on Transnational Families	JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY												This paper advocates the adoption of a mixed-methods research design to describe and analyze ego-centered social networks in transnational family research. Drawing on the experience of the "Social Networks Influences on Family Formation" project (2004 - 2005; see Bernardi, Keim, & von der Lippe, 2007a, 2007b), I show how the combined use of network generators and semistructured interviews (N = 116) produces unique data on family configurations and their impact on life course choices. A mixed-methods network approach presents specific advantages for research on children in transnational families. On one hand, quantitative analyses are crucial for reconstructing and measuring the potential and actual relational support available to children in a context where kin interactions may be hindered by temporary and prolonged periods of separation. On the other hand, qualitative analyses can address strategies and practices employed by families to maintain relationships across international borders and geographic distance, as well as the implications of those strategies for children's well-being.

The location of sampling stations is one of the most critical factors in monitoring network design. Most previous studies have focused on mathematical aspects of monitoring network design, whereas human activities within a river basin are often not considered comprehensively. In this study, a new water monitoring network design procedure is introduced to identify representative river water quality sampling locations. The new procedure combines river mixing length, human activities, and geographic information systems (GIS) to locate position of sampling points. An implementation of a new potential pollution score (PPS) model of land use helps to classify the importance of each sampling point prior to selecting the most appropriate locations for an entire river system. With the study area, urban and agriculture are mainly concentrated in the downstream area and were the primary non-point pollution sources in this region. Seven sampling points are proposed to monitor river water quality in the study area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The networked control system is modeled as a discrete-time switched system with time delay and parametric uncertainties. If feedback control access rate is higher than the stability condition, then the designed scheduling strategy can guarantee every subsystem reaches exponential stability. Sufficient condition for exponentially stability is also presented, and the result shows systems can be stabilized under the designed switch laws.

Different from the well used assumption that the normalized fuzzy weighting function for each subsystem is available at the filter node, we consider a practical case in which not only the measurement but also the normalized fuzzy weighting functions are transmitted via the network medium to the filter node. For the network characteristics, we consider the multiple packet dropouts which are described by using a Markov chain. We aim to design mode-dependent and fuzzy-basis-dependent T-S fuzzy filter by using the transmitted packet subject to the described network issue. With the augmentation technique, we obtain a stochastic filtering error system in which the filter parameters and the Markovian jumping variable are all involved. A sufficient condition which guarantees the stochastic stability and the H-infinity performance is derived with the Lyapunov method. Based on the sufficient condition, we propose the filter design method and the filter parameters can be determined by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A tunnel-diode circuit in a network environment is presented to show the effectiveness and the advantage of the proposed design approach.																			0743-1619	2378-5861	978-1-4799-3274-0				2014							5373	5378																WOS:000346492605157

However, there are two main communication bottlenecks in multi-GPU systems - accessing remote GPU memory and the communication between GPU and the host CPU. Recent advances in multi-GPU programming, including unified virtual addressing and unified memory from NVIDIA, has made programming simpler but the costly remote memory access still makes multi-GPU programming difficult. In order to overcome the communication limitations, we propose to leverage the memory network based on hybrid memory cubes (HMCs) to simplify multi-GPU memory management and improve programmability. In particular, we propose scalable kernel execution (SKE) where multiple GPUs are viewed as a single virtual GPU as a single kernel can be executed across multiple GPUs without modifying the source code. To fully enable the benefits of SKE, we explore alternative memory network designs in a multi-GPU system. We propose a GPU memory network (GMN) to simplify data sharing between the discrete GPUs while a CPU memory network (CMN) is used to simplify data communication between the host CPU and the discrete GPUs. These two types of networks can be combined to create a unified memory network (UMN) where the communication bottleneck in multi-GPU can be significantly minimized as both the CPU and GPU share the memory network. We evaluate alternative network designs and propose a sliced flattened butterfly topology for the memory network that scales better than previously proposed alternative topologies by removing local HMC channels. In addition, we propose an overlay network organization for unified memory network to minimize the latency for CPU access while providing high bandwidth for the GPUs. We evaluate trade-offs between the different memory network organization and show how UMN significantly reduces the communication bottleneck in multi-GPU systems.

We present a new continuous equilibrium network design problem to decide the capacity and fare of these parking lots at a tactical level. We assume that the parking facilities have already been located and other topological decisions have already been taken. The modeling approach proposed is mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints. In the outer optimization problem, a central Authority evaluates the performance of the transport network for each network design decision. In the inner problem a multimodal traffic assignment with combined modes, formulated as a variational inequality problem, generates the share demand for modes of transportation, and for parking facilities as a function of the design variables of the parking lots. The objective is to make optimal parking investment and pricing decisions in order to minimize the total travel cost in a subnetwork of the multimodal transportation system. We present a new development in model formulation based on the use of generalized parking link cost as a design variable. The bilevel model is solved by a simulated annealing algorithm applied to the continuous and non-negative design decision variables. Numerical tests are reported in order to illustrate the use of the model, and the ability of the approach to solve applications of moderate size.

However, the hardware circuits that can perform real-time IR task with high-effective analog computation are few in the literature. To address such problem, we propose a memristor-based continuous Hopfield neural network (HNN) circuit for processing the IR task in this work. In our circuit, a single memristor crossbar array is used to represent synaptic weights and perform matrix operations. Current feedback operation amplifiers are utilized to achieve integral operation and output function. Given these designs, the proposed circuit can perform continuous recursive operations in parallel and process different optimization problems with the programmability of the memristor array. On the basis of the proposed circuit, binary and greyscale image restorations are conducted through self-organizing network operations, providing a hardware implementation platform for IR tasks. Comparative simulations show the designed HNN circuit provides effective improvements in terms of speed and accuracy compared with software simulation. Moreover, the hardware circuit shows good robustness to memristive variation and input noise.

Firstly, a new type of 112 stochastic fuzzy neural network with parameter uncertainties is proposed. The parameter uncertainties can be efficiently tackled by lower and upper membership functions and relative weighting functions.

From the literature, 189 samples of different FA geopolymer concrete mix-designs were collected and analysed according to ten input variables (all relevant mix-design parameters) and the output variable (cylindrical compressive strength). The developed optimal FLNN model proved to be a powerful tool for predicting the compressive strength of FA geopolymer concrete with a small range of mean squared error (MSE = 10.4 and 15.0), a high correlation coefficient with the actual values (R = 96.0 and 97.5) and a relatively small root mean squared error (RMSE = 3.22 and 3.87 MPa) for the training and testing data, respectively. Based on the optimised model, a powerful design chart for determining the mix-design parameters of FA geopolymer concretes was generated. It is applicable for both one- and two-part geopolymer concretes, as it takes a wide range of mix-design parameters into account. The design chart (with its relatively small error) will ensure cost- and time-efficient geopolymer production in future applications.

The quality is measured considering both customers' travel distances and congestion delays. The strategies include opening new facilities, increasing the service capacities, and incorporating multiple backup services for customers, empowering the network to distribute the facilities' workload smoothly. The goal is to optimally configure the congested network while improving the service quality. Each facility is modeled as an M/M/1 queuing system and might be broken down frequently during its serving process. The recovery starts immediately, which is a multi-step process, and each step takes an exponentially-distributed random time. The problem is first modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear program; then, reformulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone program and can be optimally solved. An efficient solution algorithm based on Lagrangian decomposition is also developed. The numerical experiments illustrate the high efficiency of the solution methodology. Several managerial implications, including determining the best backup service level, are provided. Last, an example in distributed computing system design is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the model.

In this paper, the uncertainty of time delays is regarded as that of coefficient matrices in system state equations. Furthermore, NCS is modeled as an uncertain discrete-time model with time delays. Based on the model, the problem of stable control for NCS is converted to studying the robust stability of an uncertain discrete-time system with time delays. In terms of Lyapunov theory and LMI method, the sufficient conditions of NCS robust stability is deduced to be equivalent to solving a set of LMIs by static state feedback. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.					Li, Xiaoli/GYQ-7384-2022														2474-2953		978-1-4244-0341-7				2006							12	+																WOS:000246927400003

Fine-grained mixed-precision low-bit training is the most promising way for high-efficiency training, but it needs dedicated processor designs to overcome the overhead in control, storage, and I/O and remove the power bottleneck in floating-point (FP) units. This article presents a dynamic execution NN processor supporting fine-grained mixed-precision training through an online quantization sensitivity analysis. Three key features are proposed: the quantization-sensitivity-aware dynamic execution controller, dynamic bit-width adaptive datapath design, and the low-power multi-level-aligned block-FP unit (BFPU).

To fully consider the effects of quantizations, a new GC function is adopted, where the quantized state and quantized input instead of the normal state and normal input are contained. The nonfragile GC controller design criteria of the discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems are derived, which are expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, based on the two-step design strategy, the corresponding GC controller parameters can be obtained easily via the LMI toolbox.

Based on continuous recurrent neural networks, bipolar patterns inputted from external can cause the output of neural networks to be memorized patterns. In the method, two conditions relevant to external inputs are derived to ensure the network states converge to a stable interval, and an exponential stable criterion is proposed for the network being a bipolar associative memory with higher recall speed. By introducing a tunable slope activation function and considering time delay, the proposed model is general and can recall the memorized patterns in auto-associative and hetero-associative way, while higher robust and more flexible memory can be obtained through the proposed method. Experimental verification demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, J; Lu, KJ; Wang, JP; Qiao, CM				Wang, Jin; Lu, Kejie; Wang, Jianping; Qiao, Chunming			A Joint Network Coding and Device Association Design for Optimal Local Data Exchange in Fiber-Wireless Access Network	JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY												For many emerging mobile broadband services and applications, the source and destination are located in the same local region. Consequently, it is very important to design access networks to facilitate efficient local data exchange. In the past few years, most existing studies focus on either the wired or wireless domains. In this paper, we aim to exploit both the wired and wireless domains. Specifically, we consider a fiber-wireless access network in which a passive optical network (PON), consisting of one optical line terminal and multiple optical network units (ONUs), connects densely deployed base stations. In such a scenario, we propose two novel access schemes to utilize both network coding and device association in the following two cases: each device can be associated with one ONU for uploading and downloading its data packets; and each device can be associated with two different ONUs for uploading and downloading its data packets, which are referred to as, the network coding design and symmetric device association (NCsDA) problem and the network coding design and asymmetric device association (NCaDA) problem, respectively. To understand the potentials of NCsDA, we first formulate a mixed integer non-linear programming to minimize the weighted number of packet transmissions (WNT), which is related to both the energy consumption and system capacity. We then theoretically analyze the tight upper bounds of the minimal WNT in the PON, which helps us to approximate the NCsDA problem by mixed integer linear programming. We also give theoretical analysis on the NCaDA problem and formulate it as a mixed integer linear programming. Next, we develop efficient algorithms based on linear programming relaxation and give network coding designs to solve the NCsDA problem and the NCaDA problem. To validate our design, we conduct extensive simulations, which demonstrate the impact of important network parameters and the promising potentials of the proposed NCsDA and NCaDA schemes.

In the addressed RNN model, the delays occurring in the information interconnections are allowed to be different, and the phenomenon of sensor saturation is taken into consideration in the measurement model. A novel dynamic event-triggered protocol is employed in the data transmission from sensors to the observer with hope to improve the efficiency of resource utilization, where the threshold parameters are adaptive to the dynamical environment. By virtue of the Lyapunov-like approach, a general framework is established for examining the boundedness of the estimation errors in mean-square sense, and the ultimate bound of the error dynamics is also acquired. Subsequently, the explicit expression of the desired PIO is parameterized by using the matrix inequality techniques. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PIO design scheme.

The OCN is modeled by means of graph theoretic tools and a regulation scheme is designed basing on an outer reference generation loop for the whole OCN and a set of local controllers. Specifically, it is devised a fully distributed adaptive consensus-based algorithm within the discrete-time domain capable of: 1) generating a suitable tracking reference that stabilizes the water increments over the underlying network at a common level; 2) coping with general flow constraints related to each channel of the considered system. This iterative procedure is derived by solving a guidance problem that guarantees to steer the regulated network - represented as a closed-loop system - while satisfying requirements (1) and (2), provided that a suitable design for the local feedback law controlling each channel flow is already available. The proposed solution converges exponentially fast towards the average consensus thanks to a Metropolis-Hastings design of the network parameters without violating the imposed constraints over time. In addition, numerical results are reported to support the theoretical findings, and the performance of the developed algorithm is discussed in the context of a realistic scenario.					; CENEDESE, ANGELO/B-7525-2013	FABRIS, MARCO/0000-0003-1728-1331; CENEDESE, ANGELO/0000-0003-2249-5094													2169-3536						2024	12						14423	14436		10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3357722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3357722													WOS:001157911400001

A novel state-dependent switching (SDS) approach to tune the switching topology of CDNs is designed based on the information of the node dynamics with impulses. Different from the traditional SDS results which are based on continuous state space, some sufficient conditions for network synchronization based on SDS are proposed in the framework of impulse action. A relationship between impulse action, the network structure, and switching topology is established, which is crucial to design the SDS law. Two different impulse actions on the network dynamics are fully considered in this paper, namely, stabilizing continuous dynamics with desynchronizing impulses and destabilizing continuous dynamics with synchronizing impulses.

Especially, wearable monitoring systems require both ultralow power consumption and sufficiently complex deep neural network (DNN) classifiers to identify asymptomatic and critical health conditions, such as atrial fibrillation (AF). Such continuous data streams pose unique constraints on the processing pipeline for classification systems, which can be addressed in the design methodology of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In this work, we identify specific constraints to define common operating conditions, which guide the design of ECG accelerators in an algorithm-hardware codesign methodology. In specific, we show that the input frame size and the number of classifications per time frame play a significant role for the computational complexity (CC) of the classifier, as well as the ECG accelerator executing the classifier in a continuous manner. As an example, the constraints are applied in a top-down algorithm-hardware codesign flow. Here, an ECG accelerator is designed starting from an AF classifier, while proposed constraints are considered in an early design stage to estimate costs for the hardware design. In the end, it is essential for future ECG accelerators to adhere to common constraints in the design process to handle increasingly complex DNN classifiers for continuous data streams with ultralow power targets.					; Gemmeke, Tobias/D-5210-2017	Loh, Johnson/0009-0001-2659-5255; Gemmeke, Tobias/0000-0003-1583-3411													1063-8210	1557-9999				JAN	2024	32	1					68	78		10.1109/TVLSI.2023.3329360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2023.3329360		NOV 2023											WOS:001111132700001

Neural networks are utilized to approximate unknown functions, and a stable adaptive neural backstepping controller is synthesized. It is proven that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero by choosing the design parameters appropriately. Compared with the existing results for discrete-time systems, the proposed algorithm needs only less parameters to be adjusted online, therefore, it can reduce online computation burden.

To handle this, a new sampled-data disturbance rejection control method is developed via a well-designed discrete-time dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). First, a predictor-based generalized proportional integral observer is introduced to estimate the lumped disturbances, when only the sampled-data output is available. Then, a composite proportional feedback controller is formed by fully utilizing disturbance estimation. The composite controller updates only when the designed discrete-time DETM is violated, resulting in remarkable communication and computation resource savings while maintaining the desirable disturbance rejection ability. The designed DETM can be applied to digital computers easily due to the discrete-time detection. Simulations and experiments are carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Both Denial-of-Service (DoS) and deception attacks are taken into consideration. The objective of the addressed problem is to design the state estimation algorithm for the artificial neural networks under investigation in spite of the existence of the malicious mixed attacks. By means of the set-membership approach in combination with certain convex optimization algorithm, the sufficient condition is established for the existence of the desired state estimator in terms of the solvability of a recursive matrix inequality. The resulting state estimation error is confined within certain pre-specified ellipsoidal region. An optimization problem is then formulated with the purpose of seeking the filtering parameters guaranteeing the locally optimal performance. Finally, the developed theoretical results are verified via an illustrative numerical example. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This problem (for a single positive system), raised recently in the area of positive systems theory, is known to be challenging due to its inherent nonconvexity. In contrast to most works, which only provide sufficient synthesis conditions for a single positive system, we study this problem within a primal-dual scheme, in which necessary and sufficient synthesis conditions are proposed for networked positive systems. Based on the equivalent conditions, we develop a primal-dual iterative algorithm for solution, which helps prevent from converging to a local minimum. In the simulation, two illustrative examples are employed for verification of our proposed results.

The agents are at most critically stable and non-introspective (i.e. the agents have no access to their own states or outputs). There exists full state coupling among the agents. An upper bound for the delay tolerance is obtained which explicitly depends on agent dynamics. For any unknown delay satisfying this upper bound, a controller design methodology is proposed without relying on exact knowledge of the network topology so that synchronization in a set of unknown networks can be achieved.																			0743-1546		978-1-4799-7886-1				2015							7054	7059																WOS:000381554507041

After demarcating between forward, optimisation and inverse machine learned operators, the investigation proposes a novel methodology based on the recently developed influence zone concept which represents a fundamental shift in approach compared to traditional structural design methods. The aim of this approach is to conceptualise a non-iterative structural design model that predicts cross-section requirements for continuous beam systems of arbitrary system size. After generating a dataset of known solutions, an appropriate neural network architecture is identified, trained, and tested against unseen data. The results show a mean absolute percentage testing error of 1.6% for cross-section property predictions, along with a good ability of the neural network to generalise well to structural systems of variable size.

Existing and future information systems place a significant load on the tactical data network, resulting in a bandwidth management crisis, yet there is no prioritization, allocation, planning, or management tool available to simulate information flows over time for different communications configurations under different operational conditions. The development of such a tool requires the implementation of a communication network model and the supporting discrete-event simulation system. Models for the information systems that induce flows, the command posts using the information systems, and the influence of operational conditions on the information flows are also required, as is a graphical user interface that allows the tactical planner to configure the system and set up data capture.

A fuzzy detective observer is designed to detect the faults. Based on the fuzzy detective observer, a fuzzy controller is designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to ensure that the closed-loop system without faults is asymptotically stable. For the discrete-time fuzzy bilinear system with faults, a fuzzy adaptive diagnostic observer is designed to estimate the faults by solving a set of LMIs. Then, a fuzzy fault tolerant controller is designed based on the fuzzy diagnostic observer to ensure that the closed-loop system with faults is asymptotically stable. At last, simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed output feedback fault-tolerant control method.

However, the high dynamics of network topology and large scale of mega-constellation pose new challenges to the constellation simulation and performance evaluation. In this paper, we introduce UltraStar, a lightweight network simulator, which aims to facilitate the complicated simulation for the emerging mega-constellation of unprecedented scale. Particularly, a systematic and extensible architecture is proposed, where the joint requirement for network simulation, quantitative evaluation, data statistics and visualization is fully considered. For characterizing the network, we make lightweight abstractions of physical entities and models, which contain basic representatives of networking nodes, structures and protocol stacks. Then, to consider the high dynamics of Walker constellations, we give a two-stage topology maintenance method for constellation initialization and orbit prediction. Further, based on the discrete event simulation (DES) theory, a new set of discrete events is specifically designed for basic network processes, so as to maintain network state changes over time. Finally, taking the first-generation Starlink of 11 927 low earth orbit (LEO) satellites as an example, we use UltraStar to fully evaluate its network performance for different deployment stages, such as characteristics of constellation topology, performance of end-to-end service and effects of network-wide traffic interaction. The simulation results not only demonstrate its superior performance, but also verify the effectiveness of UltraStar.

However, it is quite difficult because of the existence of NN approximation errors. Unlike existing works that use discontinuous functions to eliminate the effects of NN approximation errors, a novel continuous function is proposed by utilizing the idea of time varying boundary layer technique. Firstly, we design a continuous NN adaptive controller with dynamic coupling strengths for the case with time invariant topology. It is shown that asymptotical consensus can be achieved without requiring any global information. Secondly, we consider time varying communication networks and design a continuous NN adaptive controller with fixed coupling strength. It is shown that the consensus error is ultimately uniformly bounded if the average dwell time is larger than a positive scalar. Finally, two examples are studied to verify the theoretical results, respectively.

Comparison of Petri Net and Finite State Machine Discrete Event Control of Distributed Surveillance Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS												Wireless sensor networks are an important military technology with civil and scientific applications. In this article, we derive a discrete event controller system for distributed surveillance networks that consists of three interacting hierarchiessensing, communications, and command. Petri Net representations of the hierarchies provide plant models of resource contention and internal consistency. Control specifications are derived that enforce consistency across the hierarchies. Three controllers are created using different methodologies to satisfy these specifications. The methods used are Petri Net, finite state automata using the Ramadge and Wonham approach, and vector addition control using the Wonham and Li approach. We use the controllers derived to contrast the design methodologies. Our results find these three approaches to be roughly equivalent. Each method has advantages and disadvantages.

Design of mixed energy-integrated batch process networks by Pseudo-direct approach	AICHE JOURNAL												In this article, a novel framework for the design of mixed (combined direct and indirect) integration for batch process systems is presented. The framework is based on the concept of pseudo-direct energy integration (PDEI) which reformulates indirect integration as direct integration using pseudo-process streams. Two algorithms are presented to achieve energy integration for batch processes operating cyclically (in a campaign mode). The first algorithm targets maximization of energy recovery and overcomes the limitations of some of the existing contributions for design of mixed integrated systems. The second algorithm provides a network reduction methodology to generate a cadre of integrated designs while exploring the trade-off between capital (number of heat exchangers and storage units) and operating costs (utility consumption). The proposed framework is illustrated using a benchmark example of two hot and two cold streams.

In the design procedure, two networks are provided where one is an action network to generate an optimal control signal and the other is a critic network to approximate the cost function. An optimal control signal and adaptation laws can be generated based on two NNs. In the previous approaches, the weights of critic and action networks are updated based on the gradient descent rule and the estimations of optimal weight vectors are directly adjusted in the design. Consequently, compared with the existing results, the main contributions of this paper are: 1) only two parameters are needed to be adjusted, and thus the number of the adaptation laws is smaller than the previous results and 2) the updating parameters do not depend on the number of the subsystems for MIMO systems and the tuning rules are replaced by adjusting the norms on optimal weight vectors in both action and critic networks. It is proven that the tracking errors, the adaptation laws, and the control inputs are uniformly bounded using Lyapunov analysis method. The simulation examples are employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.					Liu, Yan-Jun/H-6371-2011; 刘, 严君/GZL-5764-2022; Chen, C. L.

A typical objective is to minimise capital cost whilst satisfying hydraulic performance of the network. Pipes are manufactured in discrete diameters, where available sizes depend on the pipe material. Approaches to the pipe-sizing problem can be broadly grouped into the three categories. The trial and error method using a hydraulic simulator, the optimal design using nonlinear programming and the optimal design using discrete search methods such as genetic algorithms. The trial and error method is time consuming and requires a significant experience from the user. The nonlinear programming approach may lead to finding a local rather than the global solution. The discrete search methods can potentially find the global optimum but they require long calculation time. The paper proposes a hybrid approach by combining the nonlinear programming and the evolutionary approaches. The method is efficient in finding the global optimum in a comparatively short time and can facilitate significantly the interactive design procedure.																					90-5809-608-4				2003							157	164																WOS:000186106300017

Therefore, how to design more robust defense measures to minimize the loss is a great challenge. In recent years, defense strategies for enhancing the robustness of the networks are developed based on the game theory. However, the aforementioned method cannot effectively solve the defending problem on large-scale networks with a full strategy space. In this study, we achieve the purpose of protecting the infrastructure networks by allocating limited resources to monitor the targets. Based on the existing two-person zero-sum game model and the Double Oracle framework, we propose the EMSL algorithm which is an approximation algorithm based on a greedy search to compute effective mixed strategies for protecting large-scale networks. The improvement of our approximation algorithm to other algorithms is discussed. Experimental results show that our approximation algorithm can efficiently compute the mixed strategies on actual large-scale networks with a full strategy space, and the mixed defense strategies bring the highest utility to a defender on different networks when dealing with different attacks.

In today's information society with advanced telecommunications through mobile devices and computer networks, it is important to form a variety of virtual organizations and communities. Such virtual associations of people by professional or other interests are designed to quickly solve various tasks: to perform project tasks, create startups to attract investors, network marketing, distance learning, solving complex problems in science, economics and public administration, construction of various Internet services, discussion of political and social processes, etc. Objective of the study is to develop an adaptive Markov recurrent method based on the stochastic approximation of the modified condition of complementary non-rigidity, valid at Nash equilibrium points for solving the problem of game coverage of projects. Method. In this work the multiagent game model for formation of virtual teams of executors of projects on the basis of libraries of subject ontologies is developed. The competencies and abilities of agents required to carry out projects are specified by sets of ontologies. Intelligent agents randomly, simultaneously and independently choose one of the projects at discrete times. Agents who have chosen the same project determine the current composition of the team of its executors. For agents' teams, a current penalty is calculated for insufficient coverage of competencies by the combined capabilities of agents. This penalty is used to adaptively recalculate mixed player strategies. The probabilities of selecting those teams whose current composition has led to a reduction in the fine for non-coverage of ontologies are increasing. During the repetitive stochastic game, agents will form vectors of mixed strategies that will minimize average penalties for non-coverage of projects. Results. For solve the problem of game coverage of projects, an adaptive Markov recurrent method based on the stochastic approximation of the modified condition of complementary non-rigidity, valid at Nash equilibrium points, was developed. Conclusions. Computer simulation confirmed the possibility of using the stochastic game model to form teams of project executors with the necessary ontological support in conditions of uncertainty. The convergence of the game method is ensured by compliance with the fundamental conditions and limitations of stochastic optimization. The reliability of experimental studies is confirmed by the repeatability of the results obtained for different sequences of random variables.

Application of Artificial Neural Networks as Design Tool for Hot Mix Asphalt	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY												Reducing lab work to save time and costs has become one of the challenges which need to be taken on by researchers, for this reason, and a lot of studies have been performed to achieve this aim. Many approaches were developed for developing these models such as statistical, mathematical, mechanistic and so on. In the last decades, an advanced approach simulating the human neural system has opened the door for researchers to do what other approaches have failed with. One of these advanced approaches is called artificial neural networks (ANN) as one of so-called artificial intelligence (AI). The purpose of this study is to introduce ANN as a design tool for hot mix asphalt (HMA) based on actual data for job mix formula; achieving these points will contribute to reducing the time, cost, and data in the design of hot mixes asphalt. Data of 252 mixes were collected from different highway agencies in Iraq, all these mixes were designed according to the Marshall method. The data of 170 mixes were used for developing the ANN model, while the data of 82 mixes were discarded due to the shortage of information. Ten parameters (penetration, kinematic viscosity, surface area of aggregate, mechanical abrasion, and binder content) were extracted from the data of 170 mixes to be used as input and outputs variables for training the ANN. The results showed the visibility of ANN as a tool for designing the HMA as shown from the high correlation and quality analysis.

Two kinds of stochastic time-varying communication delays, namely stochastic discrete delays and stochastic distributed delays, are simultaneously considered. The purpose of the addressed filtering problem is to design a filter such that, for the admissible random measurement missing and communication delays, the filtering error dynamics is asymptotically stable in the mean square with a prescribed H 8 performance index. In terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, a sufficient condition is established that ensures the asymptotical stability in the mean square with a prescribed H 8 performance index of the filtering error dynamics and then the filter parameters are characterised by the solution to an LMI. A numerical example is introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.

Since Clifford algebra is a unital associative algebra and its multiplication is noncommutative, to overcome the difficulty of the noncommutativity of the multiplication of Clifford numbers, we first decompose the considered Clifford-valued neural network into 2m2n real-valued systems. Second, based on the Banach fixed point theorem, we establish the existence and uniqueness of almost periodic solutions of the considered neural networks. Then, by designing a novel state-feedback controller and constructing a proper Lyapunov function, we study the global asymptotic synchronization of the considered neural networks. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness and feasibility of our results.					yongkun, Li/AAC-1352-2021	yongkun, Li/0000-0002-3645-1167													1076-2787	1099-0526					2019									6982109	10.1155/2019/6982109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/6982109													WOS:000469203200001

Modeling the compressive strength of molasses-cement sand system using design of experiments and back propagation neural network	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY												Molasses, an eco-friendly and relatively cheap binder may be used as a substitute for chemical binders. For commercial exploitation of the molasses-cement sand system it is essential to generate models for predicting the properties of the sand mix from the composition. Central composite design is used to develop regression equations for predicting compressive strength of the sand mix when molasses is varied between 5.5% and 7.5% and cement between 2% and 4%. Though central composite design is an effective tool for studying the complex effects of number of independent variables on response factor it has quite a few limitations. Back propagation neural network is not only capable of modeling highly non-linear relationship using dispersed data in the solution domain but has a few advantages over the central composite design. But one of the major drawbacks of this network is that no theoretical basis exists to determine the number of hidden layers and number of neurons therein. Different configurations of BPNN have great effects on the predicted results. Back propagation neural networks of different configurations are trained. Results obtained form these networks are analyzed and compared with those obtained form regression equations and experiments. Guidelines for selecting the effective configuration of back propagation networks are proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the neural network (NN) approximating ability and RL control design technique, an adaptive backstepping RL optimal controller and a minimal learning parameter (MLP) adaptive RL optimal controller are developed by establishing a novel strategic utility function and introducing external function terms. It is proved that the proposed adaptive RL optimal controllers can guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop systems are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The main feature is that the proposed schemes can solve the optimal control problem that the previous literature cannot deal with. Furthermore, the proposed MPL adaptive optimal control scheme can reduce the number of adaptive laws, and thus the computational complexity is decreased. Finally, the simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed optimal control schemes.

Unfortunately, existing DES simulators cannot achieve satisfactory performance at the scale of modern networks. Recent work has attempted to address these challenges by reducing the traffic processed via novel approximation techniques; however, we argue in this paper that much of the slowdown of existing DES simulators is due to their underlying software architecture. Using ideas from high-throughput simulation of virtual worlds in gaming, this paper presents a fundamental redesign of DES network simulator, DONS, that marries domain-specific aspects of packet-level network simulation with recent advances in data-oriented design. DONS can automatically parallelize simulation within and across servers to achieve high core utilization, low cache miss rate, and high memory efficiency. On a relatively weak ARM-based laptop (MacBook Air (M1, 2020)), DONS can simulate one second of a 100 Gbps, 1024-server data center in 22 minutes (a speedup of 21x compared to OMNeT++). On a cluster of CPU-based servers, DONS can achieve a speedup of 65x, matching the order of magnitude of recent GPU-accelerated deep learning performance estimators, but without any loss of accuracy.					liu, V/KIA-9904-2024	Wang, Xizheng/0009-0003-6420-9014; Gao, Kaihui/0000-0001-9013-5993; Liu, Vincent/0000-0001-7683-208X															979-8-4007-0236-5				2023							167	181		10.1145/3603269.3604844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3603269.3604844													WOS:001116971100012

To be independent from existing power grids and to use renewable energy as much as possible, a decentralized energy network is proposed as a new grid system. The decentralized energy network is placed among houses to connect them with each other, and each house has a PV panel and a battery. A contribution of this paper is a network topology and battery size exploration for the decentralized energy network in order to make effective use of renewable energy. The proposed method for exploring the decentralized energy network design is inspired by the design methodology of VLSI systems, especially design space exploration in system-level design. The proposed method is based on mixed integer programming (MIP) base power flow optimization, and it was evaluated for all design instances. Experimental results show that the decentralized energy network has the following features. 1) The energy loss and energy purchased due to power shortage were not affected by each battery size but largely affected by the sum of all battery sizes in the network, and 2) the network topology did not largely affect the energy loss and the purchased energy. These results will become a useful guide to designing an optimal decentralized energy network for each region.

Discrete-time optimal adaptive RBFNN control for robot manipulators with uncertain dynamics	NEUROCOMPUTING												In this paper, a novel optimal adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) control has been investigated for a class of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear robot manipulators with uncertain dynamics in discrete time. To facilitate digital implementations of the robot controller, a robot model in discrete time has been employed. A high order uncertain robot model is able to be transformed to a predictor form, and a feedback control system has been then developed without noncausal problem in discrete time. The controller has been designed by an adaptive neural network (NN) based on the feedback system. The adaptive RBFNN robot control system has been investigated by a critic RBFNN and an actor RBFNN to approximate a desired control and a strategic utility function, respectively. The rigorous Lyapunov analysis is used to establish uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of closed-loop signals, and the high-quality dynamic performance against uncertainties and disturbances is obtained by appropriately selecting the controller parameters. Simulation studies validate that the proposed control scheme has performed better than other available methods currently, for robot manipulators.					chen, mou/KOC-4929-2024; Yang, Chenguang/AAJ-2509-2020	Yang, Chenguang/0000-0001-5255-5559													0925-2312	1872-8286				APR 19	2017	234						107	115		10.1016/j.neucom.2016.12.048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2016.12.048													WOS:000395221800008

The feed forward back propagation neural network with ten neurons and two hidden layers is designed with conjugate gradient optimization. The library wavelet such as daubachies, symletetc are used as activation function for one hidden layer for ECG signal estimation. The performance achieved with db6 wavelet is found to be superior.

J	Keshavarz, R; Shariati, N; Miri, MA				Keshavarz, Rasool; Shariati, Negin; Miri, Mohammad-Ali			Real-Time Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform Using Metamaterial Coupled Lines Network	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES												Discrete fractional Fourier transforms (DFrFTs) are universal mathematical tools in signal processing, communications, and microwave sensing. Despite the excessive applications of DFrFT, the implementation of corresponding fractional orders in the baseband signal often leads to bulky, power-hungry, and high-latency systems. In this article, we present a passive metamaterial coupled lines network (MCLN) that performs the analog DFrFT in real-time at microwave frequencies. The proposed MCLN consists of M parallel microstrip transmission lines (TLs) in which adjacent TLs are loaded with interdigital capacitors to enhance the coupling level. We show that with the proper design of the coupling coefficients between adjacent channels, the MCLN can perform an M-point DFrFT of an arbitrary fractional order that can be designed through the length of the network. In the context of real-time signal processing for the realization of DFrFT, we design, model, simulate, and implement a 16 x 16 MCLN and experimentally demonstrate the performance of the proposed structure. The proposed innovative approach is versatile and is capable to be used in various applications where DFrFT is an essential tool. The proposed design scheme based on MCLN is scalable across the frequency spectrum and can be applied to the millimeter and submillimeter wave systems.

Integration of these external heat flows in a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) has great potential to further enhance energy efficiency of such a plant; however, it is a challenging problem arising from the large design space of heat exchanger network. In this paper, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed for the design optimization of a HRSG with consideration of all alternative matches between the HRSG and external heat flows. This model is applied to four polygeneration cases with different HRSG types, and results indicate that the optimized heat network mainly depends on the HRSG type and the model specification.

It is well known by now that the channel model signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) happens to be an important parameter related to the overall stabilisability of the output feedback loop. In this paper we offer the rules for the design of discrete-time proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for given closed loop bandwidth that quantifies the SNR requirement for the memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel over the feedback path, which is a common used communication channel model. The design is centered on a PID controller structure due to its wide use in the industry. Since we focus on a PID controller structure, we then reduce the analysis to plant models of first and second order which are the structures more compatible with the PID controller design.

According to a systematic method of constructing the exact Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model, the system uncertainty is considered to affect the membership functions. Then, the grade functions, resulting from the membership functions of the control rules, are tuned by a back-propagation network. On the other hand, the feedback gains of the control rules are determined by solving a set of LMIs which satisfy sufficient conditions of the closed-loop stability. As a result, both stability guarantee and better performance are concluded. The scheme applied to a truck-trailer system is verified by satisfactory simulation results.

Layout Selection for an Optimal Sewer Network Design Based on Land Topography, Streets Network Topology, and Inflows	WATER												This paper proposes a methodology for the layout selection of an urban drainage system as an extension to the methodology for an optimal sewer network design proposed by Duque, Duque, Aguilar, & Saldarriaga. The layout selection approach proposed in this paper uses an objective function that takes into account all input data in the problem, such as: land topography, street network topology, and inflow to each manhole. Once the layout is selected, the network is optimally designed using dynamic programming. The problem of layout selection is solved as a mixed-integer programming problem and is divided into two steps. The first step tries to define an initial layout using the network topology and land topography as a criterion. This allows for an initial hydraulic design and an approximation of the sewer network's construction costs. The second step uses the data obtained in the previous process to establish an approximation of the construction costs of each arc that can be part of the layout. This is in order to minimize the objective function of the layout selection problem so that the hydraulic design cost is also minimized. The methodology was successfully tested on three case studies: the Chico sewer network proposed by Duque et al. and two sewer network benchmarks from the literature.

In order to simplify the complexity of designing the state estimator for nonlinear delayed model of GRNs, a state estimate algorithm based on a model transformation method is presented, which goal is to get the entire system state. First, in light of the Lagrange's mean-value theorem, the nonlinear model transformation method is applied to describe the nonlinear error system as a linear time-varying model. Second, by constructing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional dependent on the composite function variables of state estimate errors, a new technique lemma is provided and applied to the stability analysis. Third, the sufficient condition of state estimator design is obtained in term linear matrix inequalities, under which, the certification of the uniform asymptotic stability for state estimate error system is derived. Finally, a simulation example illustrates the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Quantifying synchronization measures for both types have been suggested and it has been shown that both types of synchronization are correlated to the logistics performance of the manufacturing system. Previous studies have indicated that structural properties of the manufacturing network might be central influencing factors triggering synchronization emergence. Synchronizability is a network property widely studied in the complex networks field. It is a common measure to evaluate the stability of synchronization in networks based on its structural properties. The aim of this paper is to explore synchronizability in manufacturing for the first time in order to better understand the impact of structural properties of a network on the emerging synchronization phenomena. We apply a multi-method investigation by triangulating a profound literature analysis, a two-stage discrete-event simulation study and an empirical data analysis of feedback data from industrial practice. Our findings show that synchronizability relates positively to physics and negatively to logistics synchronization. Based on these findings we present first considerations towards a synchronization-oriented design and control of manufacturing systems. (C) 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

The MSRBF network holds a simple but flexible structure capable to modelling complex systems. However MSRBF is originally designed to identify observational-type input-output systems. We aim to use this efficient network to get to concise but accurate models of digital images thanks to: a) the use of multiple scales in the RBF kernel width, and b) the adoption of the forward regression orthogonal least squares (FROLS) algorithm to refine the model structure selection. Thereafter the new tailored model is excited to produce output signals aimed at be compressed by the discrete cosine transform (DCT), adopted in this work to compact signals' energy into a few coefficients. To recognise images as MSRBF networks, a mathematical modelling was done by considering the first ones as multiple-input single-output systems. Based on the new methodology a novel computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for cancer detection in X-ray mammograms was designed. Classification results show that the new CAD method helped reach a competitive diagnostic accuracy of 93.5%. It was similarly found that the MSRBF network is able to construct tailored and precise image models.

Network coding which allows coding at the intermediate nodes in the network promises to increase throughput of the whole network and better utilizes network resources. To provide both robustness and efficiency for image multi-cast over wireless ad hoc networks, a scheme based on joint multiple description coding (MDC) and network coding is proposed in this paper. Multiple description lattice vector quantization (MDLVQ) is employed to encode an image at the source node, and different descriptions are transmitted on an individually or mixed base. Linear network coding is used to mix selected packets at the intermediate nodes provided that corresponding receivers can decode the mixed packet. At the destination nodes, received original packets and mixed packets can result in a reproduction with certain quality. Experimental results validate that the proposed scheme can benefit the image transmission with better reconstructed image quality, lower failure rate and less energy consumptions.

The objective is to design a reduced-order filter, such that the estimation errors converge to zero, while an l(2)-l(infinity) performance is satisfied. A Markov chain with partly unknown transition probabilities is used to describe the network-induced delay. Then, a delay-dependent linear filter is considered, whose parameters are described by the network-induced delay. By using Finsler's lemma, sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for the existence of the desired filter are derived, which guarantee that estimation errors converge to zero with an l(2)-l(infinity) performance gamma. By solving those LMIs, filter gain matrices can be calculated. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate that the designed filter is successful even in the existence of network-induced delays. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chu, TG				Chu, TG			Convergence in discrete-time neural networks with specific performance	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												We analyze convergence in discrete-time neural networks with specific performance such as decay rate and trajectory bounds in terms of componentwise absolute (exponential) stability. Simple necessary and sufficient stability and positive invariance conditions are presented, which allow us to design a convergent network with proscribed performance. Our approach is based on a decomposition of competitive-cooperative connectivity or inhibitory-excitatory interaction that abounds in neural networks, without assuming symmetry of the connection matrices. The hey idea is that through the decomposition, we can always relate a competitive-cooperative network with a cooperative dynamical system.

By regulating incoming and outgoing packets at a particular node, this paper first proposes a new traffic-based discrete congestion control model in WSNs. Then, based on this model, an exponential-reaching-law-based discrete-time sliding mode congestion controller (DSMC) is designed, which effectively adjusts bottleneck nodes' queue length to desired value. Extensive NS-2.35 simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DSMC outperforms conventional control approaches (such as Fuzzy control, PID control and Fuzzy-PID), it significantly controls queue length and avoids congestion, and has better performance such as short delay, low packet loss rate, high throughput, long network lifetime, fast convergence and strong stability.

Closed-loop control of constrained discrete event systems: application to a networked automation system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY												In this paper, we are interested in the design of closed-loop control laws to satisfy a set of temporal constraints in discrete event systems modeled by timed event graphs (TEGs). The dynamic behavior of the TEG is represented by a system of linear equations in Max-Plus algebra. Temporal constraints are imposed on some paths of the TEG and are expressed by a set of Max-Plus linear inequalities. The proposed approach is applied to the control of a networked automation producer/consumer system under a temporal constraint. The temporal constraint to be satisfied is imposed on the response time of the considered networked automation system (NAS). The calculated control laws are causal feedbacks and can be represented by monitor places connected to the NAS model.					tebani, karima/AAG-3022-2020	KARA, Redouane/0000-0001-7678-003X													0268-3768	1433-3015				MAY	2017	90	5-8					1295	1306		10.1007/s00170-016-9466-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-016-9466-7													WOS:000400608200009

In this paper, we propose a network architecture that incorporates directional antennas with multiple orthogonal channels to effectively enhance the performance of WMNs. First, a sectored connectivity graph is introduced to model multiradio multichannel WMNs with directional antennas. Next we formulate the topology design, directional interface assignment, channel allocation, and routing mathematically as a mixed integer linear programming problem. This problem is solved using an iterated local search algorithm to obtain optimized network resource allocation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed architecture can achieve higher packet delivery ratio while providing better network fairness.

ADAPTIVE OPTIMAL CONTROL OF LINEAR DISCRETE-TIME NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH TWO-CHANNEL STOCHASTIC DROPOUTS	SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION												This paper investigates the adaptive optimal control problem and proposes fundamentally novel non-model-based approaches for linear discrete-time networked control systems (NCSs) with both sensor and actuator two-channel stochastic dropouts by using directly the data transmitted via communication networks. First, we formulate a modified algebraic Riccati equation parameterized by the system dynamics and the network-induced packet dropouts probabilities, whose solvability is related to a critical arrival probability. To deal with this problem, two model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, policy iteration (PI) and value iteration (VI), are designed with their convergence proofs. To enable the application for NCSs with unknown system dynamics, two novel online PI and VI algorithms are designed. These algorithms develop a new theoretical framework to solve the Bellman function with stochastic dropouts by using directly the data transmitted via networks. Furthermore, a bilevel learning algorithm is proposed to approximate the critical arrival probability. Last but not least, an extension of the developed online VI algorithm is presented for stochastic systems with both unmeasurable noises and stochastic dropouts.

Such resource-constrained systems cannot support the execution of neural network based tasks due to their high execution overheads on general processors. Hence, we are approaching to design realtime AI applications on embedded systems with CPU and FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) coprocessors. We use dedicated FPGA to accelerate the neural network job and utilize CPU to process the rest jobs of real-time multitasking applications. We devise an Idle-Aware Earliest Deadline First policy to co-schedule the AI applications on hybrid CPU and FPGA coprocessors. Since the implementation of neural network job on FPGA accelerator with different precision configuration will result in different execution time and accuracy, we are also interested in the design optimization of real-time AI applications running on mixed-precision neural network accelerator, with the purpose of maximizing the accuracy related rewards of all applications subject to real-time related constraints. We address the problem as a multi-stage decision procedure, and propose an efficient dynamic programming approach with two pruning policies to reduce the intermediate searching states. Extensive experiments and real-life case evaluations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches.

J	Park, WC; Song, CY				Park, Woo Chang; Song, Chang Yong			Meta-Models and Genetic Algorithm Application to Approximate Optimization with Discrete Variables for Fire Resistance Design of A60 Class Bulkhead Penetration Piece	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												A60 class bulkhead penetration piece is a fire-resistance apparatus installed on bulkhead compartments to protect lives and to prevent flame diffusion in case of fire accident in ships and offshore plants. In this study, approximate optimization with discrete variables was carried out for the fire-resistance design of an A60 class bulkhead penetration piece (A60 BPP) using various meta-models and multi-island genetic algorithms. Transient heat transfer analysis was carried out to evaluate the fire-resistance design of the A60 class bulkhead penetration piece, and we verified the results of the analysis via a fire test. The design of the experiment's method was applied to generate the meta-models to be used for the approximate optimization, and the verified results of the transient heat transfer analysis were integrated with the design of the experiment's method. The meta-models used in the approximate optimization were response surface model, Kriging, and radial basis function-based neural network. In the approximate optimization, the bulkhead penetration piece length, diameter, material type, and insulation density were applied to discrete design variables, and constraints that were considered include temperature, productivity, and cost. The approximate optimum design problem based on the meta-model was formulated such that the discrete design variables were determined by minimizing the weight of the A60 class bulkhead penetration piece subject to the limit values of constraints. In the context of approximate accuracy, the solution results from the approximate optimization were compared to actual analysis results. It was concluded that the radial basis function-based neural network, among the meta-models used in the approximate optimization, showed the most accurate optimum design results for the fire-resistance design of the A60 class bulkhead penetration piece.						song, chang-yong/0000-0002-1098-4205														2076-3417				APR	2021	11	7							2972	10.3390/app11072972	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11072972													WOS:000638352200001

In the camera's application, patients are injected with tumor seeking radiopharmaceuticals before surgery, during surgery the body of tumor is removed, and the residual tumor is located with gamma or beta imaging probes. Common elements of both types of camera include: (1) a 2-3 meter long fiber optic bundle, consisting of 19 sets of groups of three 0.9 mm diameter multiclad fibers that allow a flexible optical connection to the scintillator in addition to electrical isolation of the patient from the electronics, (2) fibers are connected to a Multi-Channel Photomultiplier (MC-PMT) which has 64 parallel channels, (3) the parallel PMT outputs feed a resistive divider network and an i-V converter/line driver network with gain adjust adjustments, producing balanced +X, -X, +Y, and -Y outputs for analog image signals, (4) four ADCs connected to a Macintosh PC for digitizing and displaying the image. The beta camera utilized a 0.5 mm thick by 1.25 cm diam. CaF2(Eu) scintillation crystal coupled to 19 2-mm diameter multiclad optical fibers, which are in turn coupled by a longer fiber bundle to the MC-PMT. The crystal is coupled to fibers through a diffusing light guide ensuring adequate distribution of scintillation light among fibers. Image signals are directly histogrammed and displayed after Anger logic computations are performed on analog signals. The gamma camera concept was tested with 3 mm thick continuous crystals and matrices of CsI(TI) as the system front end with the same fiber optic coupling as the beta camera, and data processings analogous to the beta camera. With the matrices of crystals, a configuration which used a light diffuser between the matrix and fiber optics was evaluated. The beta imaging probe produced images with 0.6 mm FWHM resolution and a flood field uniformity of +/- 15%. The continuous crystal imaging probe gave intrinsic resolutions of 1.4 +/- 0.2 mm FWHM at 122 keV. Flood field images, made with the diffuser between fiber optics and discrete crystals, completely resolved the 1 x 1 mm(2) elements Intrinsic resolution as measured by a line spread function was 0.92 +/- 0.03 mm FWHM.

A hierarchical formation controller design is proposed to avoid the dynamics mismatch among agents with different dynamics orders. Firstly, a group of virtual agents are developed to act as the high-level reference generators. Neural networks are then employed for agents to construct adaptive low-level motion controllers. The high-level design and the low-level design are then composited to obtain the distributed hierarchical formation controller.

This design methodology expands the impedance space by adding free factors to the current equation of traditional inverse class-F power amplifier (PA). Additionally, an output matching network (OMN) incorporating an elliptical low-pass filter creates two transmission zeros near the passband and provides a rapid transition to the impedance from passband to stopband. In order to verify the effectiveness and superiority of this design method, an ultrawideband PA working over 0.7-3.7 GHz (136.4%) is designed and fabricated. Over this frequency range, the drain efficiency (DE) is measured as 60.7%-73.4% with the output power of greater than 41 dBm and a large signal gain ranging from 11 to 12.7 dB. This power amplifier combines the novel continuous inverse class-F theory with an ultrawideband design method to propose a hybrid extended continuous inverse class-F design theory that achieves cross-octave and high efficiency. The novel continuous inverse class-F theory extends the impedance space by adding two free factors to the current equation, achieving good bandwidth expansion. An elliptical low-pass filter is used to achieve low transmission loss and fast impedance conversion from pass to reject bands. image																			0098-9886	1097-007X				2024 JUN 12	2024										10.1002/cta.4139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cta.4139		JUN 2024											WOS:001244408000001

In these networks, it is also common and useful for mobile nodes serving as data collector or packet relayers. Hence, it is of great interest to investigate whether and how the design of mobile nodes can accelerate the discrete time average consensus while preserving the consensus value. This paper exploits a mobile node to reach fast discrete time average consensus. First, we give a sufficient condition of the mobile node's state, which guarantees the step-by-step convergence of consensus. Based on the condition, we propose a protocol for the mobile node to cope with information exchange without introducing much communication overhead for the static nodes. Then, we also provide rigorous proof that under our proposed protocol, the introduction of mobile node can increase the convergence rate of discrete time average consensus in expectation. Furthermore, a scheme to preserve the average value is provided. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol and validate the theoretical results.

Patients: Two hundred children ( age, 7 to < 18 yr) with type 1 diabetes. Intervention: At baseline, subjects were asked to wear the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) sensor and perform meter tests at eight prespecified times of the day (eight-point testing) each for 3 d ( 2 d using both, 1 d eight-point testing only, 1 d CGMS only). Hemoglobin A1c was measured in a central laboratory. Main Outcome Measure: Six-month hemoglobin A1c. This analysis looked at baseline glucose profiles/hemoglobin A1c. Results: Only 10% of subjects completed full eight-point testing for 3 d, but median CGMS use was 70 h. Mean glucose was lower when measured by the CGMS compared with eight-point testing ( 183 +/- 37 vs. 188 +/- 41 mg/dl; 10.2 +/- 2.1 vs. 10.4 +/- 2.3 mmol/liter; P = 0.009), especially overnight ( 2400 - 0400 h; 174 vs. 199 mg/dl; 9.7 vs. 11.1 mmol/liter; P < 0.001). Associations of hemoglobin A1c with mean glucose were similar for eight-point testing [ slope 23 mg/dl per1%(1.3 mmol/liter); correlation 0.40; P < 0.001] and CGMS [ slope 19 mg/dl per 1% (1.1 mmol/liter); correlation 0.39; P < 0.001]. Postprandial excursions were lower for eight-point testing vs. CGMS, especially after dinner ( mean excursion - 17 vs. 63 mg/dl; - 1.0 vs. 3.5 mmol/liter; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Both methods gave similar mean glucose profiles and associations with hemoglobin A1c. Advantages of the CGMS were higher density of data and better detection of postprandial peaks. However, the CGMS may overestimate the frequency of low glucose levels, especially overnight.

In this paper, we devise design techniques aimed to build "green" access networks to reduce energy consumption. We apply these techniques on a novel access network paradigm named Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN). We present a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) model to investigate the power consumption in WOBAN over dynamic traffic profiles. We analyze the impact of energy-aware design on the performance of WOBAN. Our results indicate that there are large scopes of power savings if we incorporate energy-aware design and routing in access networks.

The absence of a standard interface for coupling the open source EPANET software package to optimization algorithms increases the implementation effort and limits the comparison of results. This work presents a methodology for implementing an interface for coupling optimization algorithms with EPANET. The proposed technique uses the internal simulation clock events in a discrete event simulation platform to co-ordinate optimization loops and data exchange. The utilization of intermediate input/output files is avoided in order to increase the simulation speed. A water distribution network implemented in the EPANET solver is considered as a discrete event to be interfaced with optimization algorithms. The interface module is implemented as a C/C++ mex-file for EPANET in the MATLAB/Simulink platform. The methodology enables the user to evaluate the fitness of the design parameters with easy access to data logging and visualization tools at run-time. The proposed technique is used to implement the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and applied to design a benchmark water distribution network.

Utilization of these networks heavily depends on product design, end-of-life options, and consumer decisions on product take-back. Joint consideration of consumer decisions and RL networks to enhance sustainability in products is where this study contributes to the literature. We develop a hybrid agent-based and discrete event simulation model to explore the impact of consumer decisions on total cost and carbon emission at the early stage of product design. The agent-based model simulates the consumer decisions on product take-back systems in order to determine the quantity of returns while the discrete event simulation models the end of life (EoL) options for products. Different product design options are incorporated to the model to investigate the impact of modularity on quantity of returns, total cost, and carbon footprint. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The proposed CNN is robust in terms of the design parameter selection, which is dependent on a set of inequalities rather than the learning procedure. Some globally exponentially stable criteria are obtained to ensure multi-valued associative patterns to be retrieved accurately. The methodology, by generating CNN where the input data are fed via external inputs, avoids spurious memory patterns and achieves (2r) n storage capacity. These analytic results are applied to the associative memory of images. The fault-tolerant capability and the effectiveness are validated by illustrative experiments.

In order to achieve maximal efficiency under various constraints, it is critical to determine how devices should connect to each other, through wired or wireless links. The impact and the design of mixed wireline and wireless networks thus require thorough investigation. In this paper, link load, efficiency, and energy consumption of this kind of heterogeneous networks are studied through the simulation of network topologies using different spatial node distribution models, including uniform distribution, Poisson point process, and Matern cluster process. How the spatial node distribution affects the performance of the mixed wireless and wireline networks is discussed.																					978-1-4577-1348-4				2011							258	262																WOS:000300719700051

A Partial Linearization Method for Multi-Objective Continuous Network Design Problem with Environmental Considerations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Nowadays, the environmental impact of transportation project and, especially air pollution impacts, are major concerns in evaluating transportation projects. Based on this concern, beside definition of traditional objective functions like total travel time and total investment cost, different type of environmental related function is considered as objective function in urban network design. In this paper, the continuous network design problem (CNDP) is formulated as a multi-objective bi-level optimization problem. The objective function of the upper level problem is a weighted combination of total travel time, total investment cost and total vehicular emission in the network. The lower level problem is the traffic assignment problem which would predict the vehicular flow on each link in the network. A new solution algorithm is proposed for solving the bi-level optimization problem by the partial linearization of the lower level problem. The solution algorithm was applied to the city of Sioux Falls, a well known transportation network.

There may be cases when several candidate mixes with different components need to be evaluated for fatigue cracking resistance prior to final mix design selection, which can be time-consuming and sometimes non-practical. To reduce the number of laboratory tests, a quick prediction method to identify the mixtures with better cracking resistance without need to complete the test is required. Artificial neural network has shown potential to predict certain properties of asphalt mixtures in recent research. This study investigated implementing one type of artificial neural network-convolutional neural network (CNN), to predict the cracking resistance of asphalt mixtures, represented by the overlay test based on the material properties and test setup parameters. The architecture of the CNN was established and optimized, with predicting capability tested and evaluated. The predicting quality of the CNN was slightly better than the linear regression model, demonstrating potential to preliminarily predict the cracking resistance so the laboratory testing effort can be reduced.

The networks we considered are very general that account for nonlinear inner-coupling structures and nonidentical exogenous disturbances. In order to save the communication cost, a pinning controller under the event-triggered scheme is designed to realize the synchronization. The notion of bounded synchronization in probability is introduced to characterize the performance of the controlled dynamical networks in the presence of exogenous disturbances, switching rules and event-triggered schemes. Upper bounds of the states of the switched stochastic complex networks are first provided, and then the controller gain, the event-trigger parameters and the average dwell time are co-designed for switched subsystems. At last, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, we restrict feasible communication sequences to periodic ones to preserve the structural properties of the plant, which separates the selection of the communication sequences from the controller design.

To obtain the low noise Solutions over a wide range of operating frequency, the overshoot resonances excited at some frequencies should be firstly analyzed. Some resonances make the signal and power integrity problems in the high speed digital boards. To solve these issues related with overshoot resonances, the equivalent circuit model for a PDN Should be developed. It is well known that the transmission line matrix (TLM) model serves a proper design method for power delivery network (PDN) including the power/ground plane, via, capacitors, and so on. As using this TLM method, the power impedance and overshoot resonance for the designed PDN call be estimated. Therefore, the power impedance and some resonances oil PDN call be easily approached and optimized for low noise interconnection design. The discrete capacitors are conventionally used to minimize the power impedance at any frequency band where the impedance of the decoupling capacitor is lower than that of the power/ground planes pair. However, the increase of equivalent series inductance (ESL) in the discrete capacitor degrades the low noise frequency bandwidth under the multilayer board environments. It is noted that the embedded discrete capacitor structure presented in this paper call be used to maintain the parasitic inductance of the decoupling capacitor as low as possible to decrease the overshoot of the resonance frequency. According to our experimental results, the resonance magnitude and power noise characteristic arc front 15 Omega to 1 Omega and from -53dBm to -64dBm, respectively.																					978-1-4244-2117-6				2008							1241	1246																WOS:000265818600197

Such models suffer from inherent lack of generality and are useful on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, determination of the best values of design and operation parameters in combination cannot be performed rigorously, but only on an experimentation basis. This work proposes a systematic procedure for optimisation. The final stage is an optimisation procedure using a genetic algorithm which uses the classic genetic operators tuned with due care to avoid local maxima of the fitness function. The actual value of the fitness function corresponding to each breeding case could be obtained by running the discrete event simulation application, but that would make for lengthy response. Therefore, a first stage of the optimising procedure is proposed that calculates the essential part of the fitness function by a neural network metamodel generalising on simulation results. Conditions for successful application of the above procedures are discussed.

Optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) has been an important tool to enhance its efficiency such that the best design is selected in a timely fashion. It, however, fails to address the issue of selecting the best and worst designs efficiently. The need to select both rapidly given a fixed computing budget has arisen from many applications. This work develops a new OCBA-based approach for selecting both best and worst designs at the same time. Its theoretical foundation is laid.

In this contribution models are developed where significant properties of communication networks such as stochastic delays, error control protocols and shared-network influences are embedded in a closed-loop control system. The resulting integrated systems are analyzed by methods of classical system theoretic and discrete-time state analysis methods as well as by computer simulations. Fundamental insights in the properties of NCSs can already be gained through system-theoretic studies on basic architectures which provide closed-form expressions which are verified and extended by more detailed studies based on tool supported discrete-time system state analysis and simulation-tool results. The approach allows for a more detailed detection of network protocol impacts on, e.g., the real-time behavior of NCSs when certain Service Level Agreements (SLA) have to be guaranteed as prescribed percentiles of control reaction times.																			2157-0221		978-1-5386-3435-6				2017							32	39																WOS:000427948400006

In addition, CNDP plays a critical role for local authorities in tackling traffic congestion with a limited budget. Due to the mutual interaction between road users and local authorities, CNDP is usually solved using the bilevel modeling technique. The upper level seeks to find the optimal capacity enhancements of selected links, while the lower level is used to solve the traffic assignment problem. In this study, we introduced the enhanced differential evolution algorithm based on multiple improvement strategies (EDEMIS) for solving CNDP. We applied EDEMIS first to a hypothetical network to show its ability in finding the global optimum solution, at least in a small network. Then, we used a 16-link network to reveal the capability of EDEMIS especially in the case of high demand. Finally, we used the Sioux Falls city network to evaluate the performance of EDEMIS according to other solution methods on a medium-sized road network. The results showed that EDEMIS produces better solutions than other considered algorithms, encouraging transportation planners to use it in large-scale road networks.

The proposed scheme suppresses the required backup link capacity while providing a guaranteed level of recovery against multiple independent link failures. The conventional scheme is based on robust optimization and suffers from the problem of overestimating the backup link capacity. The proposed scheme addresses the overestimation problem by computing the probabilistic distribution function of required backup link capacity in polynomial time. We formulate the backup network design problem with the proposed scheme as a mixed integer linear programming problem to minimize the total required backup link capacity. We prove that the decision version of backup network design problem is NP-complete. Given that network size will continue to increase, we introduce a heuristic approach of simulated annealing to solve the same problem. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme requires less total backup link capacity than the conventional scheme based on robust optimization.

First, a mixed-integer linear programming model on the non-budget-sharing mechanism is formulated, which aims to minimize the total amount of CO2 emissions generated from freight transport activities within a regional logistics network. The other two mechanisms are addressed to compare their effects on the system performance of the regional network. To empirically assess the effectiveness of the three mechanisms, a case study based on Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan regional low-carbon logistics network design is investigated. The findings show that the performance of the conditional-budget-sharing mechanism is superior to the non-budget-sharing mechanism, but inferior to the centralized-budget-sharing mechanism. Furthermore, the designed investment coordination mechanisms and corresponding optimization models provide a coordinated reference for multiple cities regarding logistics park investment and low-carbon logistics network design.

The layout selection model determines the flow rate and direction per pipe using mixed-integer programming, which results in a tree-like structured network. This network layout parametrizes a second model that determines hydraulic features including the diameter and the upstream and downstream invert elevations of pipes using a shortest path algorithm. These models are embedded in an iterative scheme that refines a cost function approximation for the first model upon learning the actual design cost from the second model. The framework was successfully tested on two sewer network benchmarks from the literature and a real sewer network located in Bogota, Colombia, that is proposed as a new instance. For both benchmarks, the proposed methodology found a better solution with up to 42% cost reduction compared to the best methodologies reported in the literature. These are near-optimal solutions with respect to construction cost that satisfy all hydraulic and pipe connectivity constraints of a sewer system.

The networks are modelled its discrete time, nth order systems. On the basis of the system state space description, a feedback control law is derived by minimising a quadratic cost functional. The proposed analytical solution to the optimisation problem allows the expression of control law in a closed form, which is simple in implementation and guarantees efficient rate computations. Afterwards, nonlinearity is introduced into the basic controller operation, which limits the transmission rates to the network transfer capabilities. The closed-loop system stability of the obtained Solution is demonstrated,, and conditions for data loss elimination and full bandwidth usage at the node implementing the designed algorithm are presented, and strictly proved.

An MPEC formulation and its cutting constraint algorithm for continuous network design problem with multi-user classes	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING												Continuous network design problem (CNDP) is to determine the set of link capacity expansions and the corresponding equilibrium flows for which the measures of performance index for the network is optimal. Conventionally, CNDP assumed users to be homogeneous, that is, all travelers on the same link of the network are identical insofar as congestion effect and they have the same value of time (VOT). In fact, it does not accord with the real situation that all have the same VOT. So, multiple user classes with different VOT should be considered. This paper examines the CNDP with different VOT for multiple user classes, which is generally expressed as a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraint (MPEC). Then, the cut constraint algorithm (CCA) is presented to solve the problem. The numerical experiments on the examples from the literature are illustrated to demonstrate that our model and algorithm are feasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Designing Networks: A Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization Approach	NETWORKS												Designing networks with specified collective properties is useful in a variety of application areas, enabling the study of how given properties affect the behavior of network models, the downscaling of empirical networks to workable sizes, and the analysis of network temporal evolution. Despite the importance of the task, there currently exists a gap in our ability to systematically generate networks that adhere to theoretical guarantees for the given property specifications. In thisarticle, we propose the use of Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization modeling and solution methodologies to address this Network Generation Problem. We present useful modeling techniques and apply them to mathematically express and constrain a broad class of network properties in the context of an optimization formulation. We derive complete formulations for the generation of networks that attain specified levels of connectivity, spread, assortativity and robustness, and we illustrate these via a number of computational case studies.

The proposed DETS uses both the current and past samples to determine the next trigger, unlike the traditional event-triggered scheme (ETS) that uses only the current sample. The proposed DETS is employed in a dual setup for two network channels to significantly reduce redundant data transmission. A DOFC is designed to achieve the synchronization of the NNs. Stability criteria of the synchronisation error system are derived based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, and the co-design of the DOFC and DETS parameters are accomplished using the Cone-complementarity linearization (CCL) approach.

The accurate observation of the concentration conversion rate of the mixture and the internal temperature of the reaction vessel is a prerequisite for obtaining the desired mixture. This paper proposes a novel observer based on residual neural networks for CSTR systems. Firstly, the mathematical model of the CSTR reaction is given, as well as a detailed description of the structure and equations of the residual neural networks and the designed observer. Then the matrix method is used for the nonlinear isolation of the residual neural networks and the theory of quadratic constraints for nonlinear activation functions of the neural networks is applied. Thus, the convergence of the proposed observer is analyzed theoretically in detail. Finally, the numerical simulations are implemented to demonstrate that the proposed residual neural network-based observer can quickly and accurately observe the state changes during the CSTR reaction.																			1007-5704	1878-7274				JAN	2024	128								107592	10.1016/j.cnsns.2023.107592	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2023.107592		OCT 2023											WOS:001096587100001

The systematic identification of retrofit designs of the existing complex network in industrial processes is case-dependent problem, especially crude oil atmospheric distillation systems. Therefore, retrofit design is one of the most challenging heat exchanger network (HEN) designs where no standard formulation deals with the fixed cost of topology changes. The revision of an existing HEN is more complex than the grassroots design. This work is to modify a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) stage-wise model using commercial optimization software; GAMS, for retrofitting HEN where the main objective is to maximize profit calculated by energy saving subtract total investment cost of additional exchanger area, new exchanger, stream splitting and repiping. The proposed model overcomes the area trade-off restriction caused by the assumption of isothermal mixing and allows several matches located on a branch of each process stream. Dealing with the MINLP case, the initialization strategy is developed to find feasible starting point for the optimization problem resulting in generating more profitable HEN design compared to the published one from the literature.																			2283-9216		978-88-95608-36-5				2015	45						1903	1908		10.3303/CET1545318	http://dx.doi.org/10.3303/CET1545318													WOS:000366034200318

Simultaneous Energy and Water Optimization in Multiple-Contaminant Systems with Flowrate Changes Consideration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In this paper, a new systematic design methodology has been developed for the simultaneous energy and water minimization in multiple-contaminant systems that also feature maximum re-use of water. In addition to allowing re-use of water in multiple-contaminant systems, issues about heat losses and flowrate changes inside unit operations have also been incorporated in this new design method. To implement such a design, two new design aspects are introduced; new method for "Non-isothermal Mixing" point identification and new "Separate System" generation. The first aspect involves "non-isothermal mixing", which enables direct heat recovery between water streams, and therefore allows the reduction of the number of heat transfer units. The other aspect is the generation of "separate system "in heat exchanger network design. The flexibility of mixing and splitting of water streams allows separate systems to be created as a cost-effective series of heat-exchanger units between freshwater and wastewater streams. The new design aspects have been illustrated with two examples.					유, 창규/AAJ-1226-2020	Yoo, ChangKyoo/0000-0002-9406-7649													1735-6865	2008-2304				WIN	2010	4	1					11	26																WOS:000273827000002

First, we design an adaptive continuous controller based on relative full states that is consist of a synchronization term and an uncertainty elimination term, where the latter term can completely eliminate the effects of target's nonzero inputs and is continuous by adding an exponential decay function with positive initial values into the denominator. By developing a stochastic Lyapunov function, we show that zero error synchronization in the mean square sense can be achieved if the union of switching graphs contains a directed spanning tree with the target being the root. Second, we design an adaptive continuous controller based on relative outputs.

To reconcile both processes and take into account demand variability, we generalize the capacitated multicommodity fixed charge network design class of problems by including different types of fixed costs (installation and maintenance costs) and variable costs (routing costs) but also variable traffic demands over multiple periods. However, conventional integer programming methods can typically solve only small to medium size instances of this problem. Two major difficulties are encountered when using commercial solvers to solve the associated mixed integer programs: (i) problems are large scale and even solving the linear relaxation of the problem can be challenging; and (ii) the solver hardly find good feasible solutions for medium to large scale instances. As an alternative, we propose a Lagrangian approach for computing a lower bound by relaxing the flow conservation constraints such that the Lagrangian subproblem itself decomposes by node. Though this approach yields one subproblem per network node, solving the Lagrangian dual by means of the bundle method remains a complex computational tasks. However, it always provides a lower bound on the optimal solution. Moreover, based on this relaxation, we propose a Lagrangian heuristic that makes the approach more robust than a black-box usage of a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver.

The reasonable design of the IT2 polynomial fuzzy event-triggered controller guarantees the closed-loop system's positivity and stability, reduces energy consumption, and efficiently utilizes the communication bandwidth. Furthermore, for DPPFNC systems with time delay, obtaining more relaxed stability conditions and lower network communication frequency is quite challenging, even for the current advanced theory. Meanwhile, to strengthen the practicality of the control strategy, the asynchronous constraints of premise variables due to the introduction of the network are considered. Aiming at the above problems, a polynomial fuzzy event-triggered control (ETC) strategy is proposed based on the stability analysis of IT2 membership function (IT2-MF) dependence and imperfect premise matching. First, the IT2 polynomial fuzzy model, which employs IT2-MFs to capture parameter uncertainty, depicts the event-triggered positive nonlinear dynamics. Second, an IT2 polynomial fuzzy event-triggered controller is designed by introducing the 1-norm ETC strategy. Then, by optimizing the approximation error between the original and the approximate membership function, a genetic algorithm is employed to relax the stability criteria. Finally, numerical and practical examples illustrate the viability of the suggested design.																			1063-6706	1941-0034				MAR	2024	32	3					1346	1358		10.1109/TFUZZ.2023.3323650	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2023.3323650													WOS:001179721500030

Our objectives are to determine which design factors influence community activity and therefore community output. We furthermore intend to make recommendations to improve the design of community systems that support professional communities using a mix of communication modes. Our study is exploratory and based on action research given the lack of studies on the design of community-supporting systems in professional communities that employ a mix of communication modes. To illustrate similarities and to enhance the generalizability of our findings, we analyzed two real-world professional communities in-depth, namely, a learning network and an interorganizational expert network. Our study shows that face-to-face communication is the primary mode of communication in these communities; the community systems that they employ only have a supporting function. This leads us to a few design guidelines for the systems that support such communities. Generally, community systems have to support professional communities' work processes and relationship development. Important functions for work-process support are those that support face-to-face meetings (for the preparation and wrap-up of meetings) and that explicitly support specific work processes. Important functions for relationship development are functions that enable or facilitate face-to-face meetings, for example, member profiles.																			1548-3908	1548-3916				OCT-DEC	2005	1	4					19	36		10.4018/jthi.2005100102	http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/jthi.2005100102													WOS:000444104200002

Under certain conditions, a surjective mapping exists between a power diagram, defined by a set of 2D vertices and associated weights, and the reciprocal diagram that characterizes the force diagram of a discrete self-supporting network. This observation lets us define a new and convenient parameterization for the space of self-supporting networks. Based on it and the discrete geometry of this design space, we present novel geometry processing methods including surface smoothing and remeshing which significantly reduce the magnitude of force densities and homogenize their distribution.

We now propose co-continuous network polymers (CNPs) for the design of tough polymer materials. CNP is a new composite material fabricated by filling the three-dimensionally continuous pores of a hard epoxy monolith with any cross-linked polymer having a low glass transition temperature (T-g). The structure and mechanical properties of the CNPs containing epoxy resins, thiol-ene thermosets, and polyacrylates as the low-T-g components were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, tensile tests as well as scanning electron microscopic observations and non-destructive 3D X-ray imaging in order to clarify a mechanism for exhibiting an excellent strength and toughness. It has been demonstrated that the mechanical properties and fractural behavior of the CNPs significantly depend on the network structure of the filler polymers, and that a simultaneous high strength and toughness are achieved via the sacrificial fracture mechanism of epoxy-based hard materials with co-continuous network structures.

To this end, we start by putting forth a novel distributed event-triggering transmission strategy based on periodic sampling, under which a model-based stability criterion for the closed-loop network system is derived, by leveraging a discrete-time looped-functional approach. Marrying the model-based criterion with a data-driven system representation recently developed in the literature, a purely data-driven stability criterion expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is established. Meanwhile, the data-driven stability criterion suggests a means for co-designing the event-triggering coefficient matrix and the feedback control gain matrix using only some offline collected state-input data. Finally, numerical results corroborate the efficacy of the proposed distributed data-driven event-triggered network system (ETS) in cutting off data transmissions and the co-design procedure.

In order to surmount the difficulty of noncommutativity of quaternion, a new vector matrix differential equation (VMDE) is proposed by employing decomposition method. And then, a nonlinear controller is designed to stabilize the VMDE in a finite-time interval. Furthermore, under that controller, the finite-time stability and instability of the QVNNs are analyzed via Lyapunov function approach, and two criteria are derived, respectively; furthermore, the settling time is also estimated.

Moreover, theoretical verifications and results verify the convergence performance and noise suppression ability of the proposed neural network, which is further verified by simulation examples. In addition, the simulations on robot motion control embody its superiority and powerful versatility compared to the existing methods.

By relaxing the tight-coupling requirement, the proposed phase shifters are realized with much easier fabrication process. It is demonstrated how the embedded low-pass/bandpass/high-pass networks make the phase shifters wideband. The fabricated phase shifters with low-pass, bandpass, and high-pass networks using discrete elements achieve the operating bandwidths of 44%, 83%, and 107%, respectively. Later, discrete elements are replaced by their equivalent short and open microstrip lines to make the system monolithic and more reliable, especially at higher frequencies.

In order to control long-term quality of Self-Compacting Semi-Lightweight Concrete (SCSLC), the 90 days compressive strength is considered as a key issue in this paper. In fact, combined artificial neural networks are used to predict the compressive strength of SCSLC at 28 and 90 days. These networks are able to re-establish non-linear and complex relationships straightforwardly. In this study, two types of neural networks, including Radial Basis and Multilayer Perceptron, were used. Four groups of concrete mix designs also were made with two water to cement ratios (W/C) of 0.35 and 0.4, as well as 10% of cement weight was replaced with silica fume in half of the mixes, and different amounts of superplasticizer were used. With the help of rheology test and compressive strength results at 7 and 14 days as inputs, the neural networks were used to estimate the 28 and 90 days compressive strengths of above-mentioned mixes. It was necessary to add the 14 days compressive strength in the input layer to gain acceptable results for 90 days compressive strength. Then proper neural networks were prepared for each mix, following which four existing networks were combined, and the combinatorial neural network model properly predicted the compressive strength of different mix designs.

Because generally the melt flow along the mixing zone is non-isothermal, one establishes relations for the temperature variation along the mixing zone, namely: temperature variation caused by, external heating, by internal friction, by external friction and due to melt compressibility. By using the established relations one develops a network procedure for pressure and temperature variation calculation along the mixing zone. The computer program based on the network procedure was used to calculate a usual mixing zone for a 63.5 mm extruder-screw. The program gives the possibility to represent the pressure and temperature variation between the inlet and the outlet of the mixing zone. This is useful when we are interested in the optimum design of such mixing zones.																			0930-777X					MAR	2000	15	1					3	11		10.3139/217.1574	http://dx.doi.org/10.3139/217.1574													WOS:000086219400002

The nonlinear system is transformed to a predictor form, and the desired control signal is thus achieved by implicit function theorem. A neural network using only a norm adaptation law is utilized to approximate this desired control signal iteratively. By using Lyapunov analysis, it is proven that all the system signals are bounded and the system tracking error converges to a neighborhood around zero as iteration number goes to infinity. In contrast to the existing AILC results, the most advantage of the proposed neural network-based AILC is that the number of the adjustable parameters is highly reduced.																					978-1-5386-5500-9				2018							854	858		10.1109/ICISCE.2018.00179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICISCE.2018.00179													WOS:000462044200169

J	Delgado, D; Claro, J				Delgado, Daniel; Claro, Joao			Transmission network expansion planning under demand uncertainty and risk aversion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS												The explicit incorporation of uncertainty in transmission network design can help to improve the balance between different and important concerns such as network utilization, demand satisfaction, or dynamic sourcing from lower-cost generation options. The explicit study of mean-risk trade-offs in network design can also better support planners in risk-related decisions. With these motivations, we present in this paper a mean-risk mixed integer linear programming model for transmission network expansion planning. The model has the potential to be used in practical applications, but in the scope of the paper is used to search for network design insights, with a study of loss-averse design of three fundamental network building blocks-an independent design, a radial design, and a meshed design. The study illustrates how different network designs feature different trade-offs between mean cost minimization and risk mitigation, focusing on the impact of network structure, loss aversion, variability, and demand correlation.

Discrete-time level-crossing analysis of soft handoff performance in cellular networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY					IEEE International Conference on Communications	APR 28-MAY 02, 2002	NEW YORK, NY	IEEE Commun Soc, ICC GLOBECOM, IEEE, AT&T Labs, Avaya Labs, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, Nokia, Polytech Univ, Verizon Commun				In this correspondence, we develop a formal method for solving a class of level-crossing problems in discrete-time with application to the analysis of soft handoff performance in cellular networks such as code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. In such networks, proper dimensioning of soft handoff parameters is critical to overcoming propagation impairments and providing a transparent radio access service for multiple user profiles. We obtain exact expressions for the cell assignment and active set update probabilities of a mobile station traveling along an arbitrary straight-line trajectory. We develop recursive algorithms to compute performance measures such as outage probability, macrodiversity gain, and signaling load. The discrete-time level-crossing analysis yields an accurate and efficient computational tool for designing and dimensioning high performance soft handoff algorithms while avoiding the need for approximations or time-consuming computer simulations.																			0018-9448	1557-9654				JUL	2006	52	7					3283	3290		10.1109/TIT.2006.876357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.876357													WOS:000238921200028

Mix design development for geopolymer treated expansive subgrades using artificial neural network	COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS												Expansive soils have been inevitable during road constructions due to its widespread availability. Conventional stabilizers; cement and lime have not been quite reliable in terms of economic, environmental, and durability perspectives. Thus, geopolymer has come into limelight as a sustainable alternative. However, the complexity of geopolymer-soil behaviour makes it challenging to predict their strength development patterns and it requires a large number of trial and error tests in laboratory scale due to the soil specific nature of such mixes. To date, no research has been attempted to develop design charts for geopolymer-expansive soil stabilization field applications. This study proposes design charts using Artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the 28-day unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of Class F fly ash (FA) based geopolymer stabilized expansive soil (PI = 32% - 46%) to support field implementation of this novel geopolymer based soil stabilization. The model was developed based on a robust collection of literature data; FA/Soil, Activator/FA, Na2SiO3/NaOH, alkaline molarity, and their respective 28-day UCS values. Three contour plots for mix design: FA/soil vs. NaOH molarity, activator/FA vs. Na2SiO3/NaOH, and Na2SiO3/NaOH vs. NaOH molarity were proposed based on the model predictions. The proposed mix design charts were validated through the in-house tests which showed reasonable match in comparison with the predicted 28-day UCS using the contour plots. The proposed mix design charts can be employed for in-situ geopolymer-expansive subgrade stabilization to achieve strengths between 0.6 and 2.1 MPa.

Given a set of nodes and a set of traffic demands between these nodes, the network design and traffic grooming problem (NDGP) consists of installing a minimum number of lightpaths between the nodes and of routing the demand on the lightpaths while respecting capacity constraints. We introduce a new mathematical formulation of the NDGP as well as a hybrid algorithm capable of finding high quality solutions in short computing times. The proposed algorithm uses linear and mixed integer programming as slave methods and embeds them within a tabu search procedure. Computational results and comparisons with an existing method from the literature show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Further analyses also show the efficiency of the neighborhood structure and of its evaluation technique. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The solution of this problem would require the continuous monitoring of several key patient parameters, including the assessment of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity using non-invasive sensors, providing information for emotional, sensorial, cognitive and physiological analysis of the patient. Recent advances in embedded systems, microelectronics, sensors and wireless networking enable the design of wearable systems capable of such advanced health monitoring. The subject of this article is an ambulatory system comprising a small wrist device connected to several sensors for the detection of the autonomic nervous system activity. It affords monitoring of skin resistance, skin temperature and heart activity. It is also capable of recording the data on a removable media or sending it to computer via a wireless communication. The wrist device is based on a Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC (TM)) from Cypress: PSoCs are mixed-signal arrays, with dynamic, configurable digital and analogical blocks and an 8-bit Microcontroller unit (MCU) core on a single chip. In this paper we present first of all the hardware and software architecture of the device, and then results obtained from initial experiments.

J	Unnikrishnan, A; Lin, DY				Unnikrishnan, Avinash; Lin, Dung-Ying			User Equilibrium with Recourse: Continuous Network Design Problem	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING												The focus of this article is to study the continuous network design problem (CNDP) that arises when users receive information about uncertain network states as they traverse the network and make en-route routing decisions. The primary motivation is to show that long-term planning decisions can change significantly when provision of information is considered. This article provides a bi-level mathematical programming network design formulation of CNDP. To efficiently solve this problem and gain the insights, we use two existing metaheuristics (a quantum-inspired genetic algorithm and a generic genetic algorithm) and replace the evaluation function to account for user behavior with information provision. Numerical tests conducted on two different networks reveal that quantum-inspired genetic algorithms marginally outperform generic genetic algorithms. The tests also reveal that network design decisions made when users have access to en-route information are considerably different from those made when users do not have access to such information. This result has significant implications because it shows that long-term planning decisions for networks in which users have access to en-route information are drastically different from those for networks without en-route information provision.																			1093-9687	1467-8667				AUG	2012	27	7			SI		512	524		10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00753.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00753.x													WOS:000305962900003

An event-triggered communication mechanism is adopted over the sensor network with hope to reduce the communication burden and the energy consumption, where the measurements on each sensor are transmitted only when a certain triggering condition is violated. Furthermore, a novel distributed state estimator is designed where the available innovations are not only from the individual sensor, but also from its neighbouring ones according to the given topology. The purpose of the problem under consideration is to design a set of distributed state estimators such that the dynamics of estimation errors is exponentially mean-square stable and also the prespecified H disturbance rejection attenuation level is guaranteed. By utilising the property of the Kronecker product and the stochastic analysis approaches, sufficient conditions are established under which the addressed state estimation problem is recast as a convex optimisation one that can be easily solved via available software packages. Finally, a simulation example is utilised to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed design scheme of event-triggered distributed state estimators.

Designing an optimal water quality monitoring network for river systems using constrained discrete optimization via simulation	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION												The problem of designing a water quality monitoring network for river systems is to find the optimal location of a finite number of monitoring devices that minimizes the expected detection time of a contaminant spill event while guaranteeing good detection reliability. When uncertainties in spill and rain events are considered, both the expected detection time and detection reliability need to be estimated by stochastic simulation. This problem is formulated as a stochastic discrete optimization via simulation (OvS) problem on the expected detection time with a stochastic constraint on detection reliability; and it is solved with an OvS algorithm combined with a recently proposed method called penalty function with memory (PFM).

More recently, there has been a growing interest in the study of tracking control problem. In this paper, we discuss the design and stability properties of a special approximate/adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method for a general multipleinput-multiple-output (MIMO) discrete-time nonlinear optimal tracking control problem. The direct heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) design algorithm is firstly derived by incorporating the PID control rule into neural networks (NNs). This design approach considers using not only the typical state variables but also their derivatives and cumulative sums as inputs to the controller output. It is therefore expected to retain PID controller properties with additional learning capability. Moreover, our nonlinear control problem is formulated under a general condition that system nonlinearity is unknown and therefore it introduces modelling errors for the controller design. By using a Lyapunov stability construct, we provide new results of uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) for the proposed PIDNN-based direct HDP controller in discrete-time nonlinear tracking setting with desired tracking performance.

Using the rate of cognitive relay network as the common utility, we firstly formulate the problem of the joint relay selection and discrete power control as a noncooperative game. Then, we prove that the proposed game is a potential game which possess at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) and the optimal strategy profile which maximizes the rate of the cognitive relay network constitutes a pure strategy NE of our proposed game. We prove that, under mild conditions, our proposed game can guarantee the feasibility of the pure strategy NE without the advance knowledge of the infeasible strategy profiles. Then we design a decentralized stochastic learning algorithm based on learning automata and prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to a pure strategy NE. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm has good convergence and promising performance.

Visual Analysis of Trajectories in Multi-Dimensional State Spaces	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM												Multi-dimensional data originate from many different sources and are relevant for many applications. One specific sub-type of such data is continuous trajectory data in multi-dimensional state spaces of complex systems. We adapt the concept of spatially continuous scatterplots and spatially continuous parallel coordinate plots to such trajectory data, leading to continuous-time scatterplots and continuous-time parallel coordinates. Together with a temporal heat map representation, we design coordinated views for visual analysis and interactive exploration. We demonstrate the usefulness of our visualization approach for three case studies that cover examples of complex dynamic systems: cyber-physical systems consisting of heterogeneous sensors and actuators networks (the collection of time-dependent sensor network data of an exemplary smart home environment), the dynamics of robot arm movement and motion characteristics of humanoids.																			0167-7055	1467-8659				SEP	2014	33	6					310	321		10.1111/cgf.12352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12352													WOS:000342802200023

A feedforward neural network with the structure of Volterra system is newly presented. This kind of mathematical model possesses more adjustable parameters than the original Volterra system to further enhance the modeling capacity. Tuning adjustable parameters inside the neural network is based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) instead of the commonly used back-propagation method. The PSO algorithm is with multiple direction searches and can easily find out the global solution for the given optimization problem. This paper also develops the whole design steps for PSO-based feedforward neural network modeling for nonlinear discrete systems. Two kinds of examples are illustrated to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method. In addition, some examinations containing different initial conditions and population sizes, and presence of measurement noises are considered to evaluate the modeling performance.

Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods case study was conducted to investigate the problem. Both strands of quantitative and qualitative data were given equal priority. Three rounds of primary data were sequentially collected, analysed and triangulated. An online questionnaire was distributed to a sampling frame of seventeen companies which were randomly selected from the population. Three company executives were purposively sampled to participate in a focus group interview. Data from an open-ended questionnaire were used to explain and validate the findings from clients and executives who participated in the two preceding rounds of data collection. Findings It was found that information sharing improves the collaboration of channel members, increases competitive advantage and ultimately leads to better customer service. The improvement of relationships and continuous technological upgrades are recommended for improving visibility of information and effectiveness in the management of supply chains. Research limitations/implications This study is limited by the characteristics of the case study methodology. Case study research suffers from restricted generalisability, problems with cross-checking and the risk of bias and subjectivity. This implies that the results of this case study may not be generalised to the overall population. The selection of a mixed methods design was intended to curb the limitations that are inherent to this study. Practical implications This study was limited to a few respondents and participants, which raises concerns about both the statistical power and the generalisability of the results. However, the results provide useful insights into some of the information sharing practices in the industry. Originality/value The value of the study contributes to the supply chain's dependence on 3PLs for value creation and the reliance on technology to share information amongst channel members. This study highlights a need for organisations to build collaborative relationships with 3PLs and continuously update technological infrastructure in order to meet supply chain network goals.

Firstly, if each node of a network is geometrically incrementally dissipative, the entire network can be viewed as a geometrically dissipative nonlinear system by choosing a particular input-output pair. Then, based on the geometrical dissipativity property, we consider two cases: output synchronization under arbitrary topology and switching topology, respectively. For the first case, we establish several criteria of output synchronization under arbitrary switching between a set of connection topologies by employing a common Lyapunov function. For the other case, we give the design method of a switching signal to achieve output synchronization even if all subnetworks are not synchronous. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the main results. (C) 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, challenges arise and remain open when shifting machine learning workloads to the serverless environment. Specifically, the restriction on the deployment size over serverless platforms combining with the complexity of neural network models makes it difficult to deploy large models in a single serverless function. In this paper, we aim to fully exploit the advantages of the serverless computing paradigm for machine learning workloads targeting atmitigating management and overall cost while meeting the response-time Service Level Objective (SLO). We design and implement AMPS-Inf, an autonomous framework customized for model inferencing in serverless computing. Driven by the cost-efficiency and timely-response, our proposed AMPS-Inf automatically generates the optimal execution and resource provisioning plans for inference workloads. The core of AMPS-Inf relies on the formulation and solution of a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming problem for model partitioning and resource provisioning with the objective of minimizing cost without violating response time SLO. We deploy AMPS-Inf on the AWS Lambda platform, evaluate with the state-of-the-art pre-trained models in Keras including ResNet50, Inception-V3 and Xception, and compare with Amazon SageMaker and three baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that AMPSInf achieves up to 98% cost saving without degrading response time performance.																			0190-3918		978-1-4503-9068-2				2021										10.1145/3472456.3472501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3472456.3472501													WOS:000946959000045

A definition of security in probability is adopted to account for the transient dynamics of controlled systems. The purpose of the problem under consideration is to design a dynamic output feedback controller such that the prescribed security in probability is guaranteed while obtaining an upper bound of the quadratic cost criterion. First of all, some sufficient conditions with the form of matrix inequalities are established in the framework of the input-to-state stability in probability. Then, an easy-solution version on above inequalities is proposed by carrying out the well-known matrix inverse lemma to obtain both the controller gain and the upper bound. Furthermore, the main results are shown to be extendable to the case of discrete-time stochastic linear systems.

D-SNDP issues focus on the principle of generalized resources especially high-quality resource sharing or complementarity. Discrete time-space networks are applied to reconstruct a dynamic service network by putting into time dimension. Then, a conceptual model and an integer programming design model of dynamic service network are both proposed with multi-arcs given with multi-commodity of same-day parcel express. This model is minimizing the total operation costs of networking with constrains on service elements, including space, cost, capacity etc. The revenue-sharing model for alliance using the generalized resource contribution coefficient V is also proposed at same time. A case analysis shows that the design model and revenue sharing model indeed play a role in improving the efficiency of network resource allocation and promoting cooperation among alliance members.

The continuous growth is also producing a by product that blocks the global distribution of data services because the evolved network functions are effective only within a single network domain. In short, the global network will have the network generations of conventional IP-based network, the next generation network, and the emerging future network. In order to achieve advanced network services utilizing evolved network functions across multiple network domains and generations, this paper proposes a network function exchange architecture. The proposed network function exchange intermediates the various differences related to control protocols, management information, and data format. A service scenario using the network function exchange and detailed architecture is described. Functional requirements of the exchange, a design of the universal interface protocol, and an operational procedure based on the design are described.

J	Hellemo, L; Tomasgard, A				Hellemo, Lars; Tomasgard, Asgeir			A generalized global optimization formulation of the pooling problem with processing facilities and composite quality constraints	TOP												We present a generalized formulation of the pooling problem. Our formulation is different from the standard formulations in explicitly modeling component flows. Modeling the physical components directly, allows easy inclusion of processing facilities that may alter the flow composition. It also allows adding composite quality constraints that cannot be added directly as quality parameters as they do not blend linearly. We provide new test instances motivated by natural gas transport problems at the Norwegian Continental Shelf and give computational results. We show examples of nonlinear composite constraints on quality attributes and give computational results on the effect of adding such constraints to the new set of test instances. The increased flexibility of our formulation comes at the cost of less tight constraints and a performance penalty on existing test cases in literature. The advantage is that it can solve the more general test cases described above. We use GAMS implementations of the various formulations and solve the problems with BARON. We compare the performance of our bilinear formulation in BARON with discretizations solved as a Mixed Integer Linear Program using CPLEX. The discretized versions do not generally perform as well as the continuous model; however, they have better worst-case behavior on the new test cases.

Protect me not: The effect of tariffs on US supply networks	JOURNAL OF PURCHASING AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT												In 2018, the United States imposed numerous tariffs with the stated intent of protecting U.S. firms from international competitors. These tariffs have had a substantial impact on supply chains which were not well understood. While tariffs can provide some protection to certain industries, they can also create inefficiencies for the industries they were designed to protect, as well as for their supply chain partners. We analyze the impacts of the tariffs imposed by the United States in 2018, on the industries they were intended to protect (steel, semiconductors, agricultural equipment, and chemicals industries) as well as on their suppliers and customers. We perform an event study to analyze the effects of four discrete suites of tariffs on the firm value of 691 publicly traded U.S. firms. We utilize resource dependence theory (RDT) to better understand the net impact of tariffs on protected industries and their supply chains. The results demonstrate that the implementation of the 2018 tariffs had an overall negative impact on firm value, leading to a decrease in the value of domestic producers within the protected industries and mixed financial effects on firms in their supplier and customer industries. These findings demonstrate the ripple effect of unintended consequences that tariffs can lead to throughout supply chains, motivating further theoretical development and informing trade policy.

Finally, these three models are compared with each other and resulted in the fact that ANN and ANFIS models enables us to reliably evaluate the compressive strength of concrete with different mix designs, however, multiple linear regression model is not feasible enough in this area because of nonlinear relationship between the concrete mix parameters. Finally, the sensitivity analysis (SA) for two different sets of parameters on the concrete compressive strength prediction are carried out.

The control system is designed on the basis of a discrete Lyapunov function. Part of the equivalent control is estimated by an on-line estimator, which is realised by a recurrent neural network (RNN) because of its outstanding ability for modelling a dynamical process. A real-time iterative learning algorithm is developed and used to train the RNN. Unlike the conventional learning algorithms for RNNs, the proposed algorithm ensures that the learning error converges to zero. As a result, the stability of the control system is always assured. In addition, this learning algorithm can be applied for on-line estimation. The proposed controller eliminates chattering and provides sliding-mode motion on the selected manifolds in the state space. Numerical examples are given and simulation results strongly demonstrate that the control scheme is very effective.																			1350-2379					JAN	1999	146	1					84	90		10.1049/ip-cta:19990376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/ip-cta:19990376													WOS:000079914800012

The suggested model utilizes continuous approximation techniques to calculate the optimal length and spacing between bike lanes, determine the number and location of bike-sharing stations, and estimate the appropriate fleet size (number of bikes). Throughout the process, both user and agency interests are considered. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, an example is provided using data from the City of Guayaquil, Ecuador. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is performed to gain further insights into the impact of significant parameters on the network design. The results indicate that agency costs constitute a relatively small proportion of the overall network costs compared to user costs. This finding suggests that the initial investment in facilities has been amortized over time, highlighting the network's long-term viability. Moreover, the study demonstrates that an increase in demand does not necessarily require a corresponding increase in investment. To strike a balance, the model tends to offer a reduced number of facilities, such as bikes, stations, and kilometers of lanes per person, while simultaneously densifying the network to reduce user access times, resulting in shorter total travel times for users. The proposed optimization model serves as a valuable tool for urban planners, aiding them in strategic design decisions during the planning stage of bike mobility systems.

The use of an appropriate mix of the two renewable energy source technologies, PV1 and WT2 in conjunction with the usage of an energy storage device, as an example a battery system, as a form of power balancing medium, might address output intermittency and dependability concerns. Different storage methods might help with the unreliability problem, but they consume a lot of electricity and produce a lot of expenses and carbon emissions. As a temporary distributed energy storage device, two-way power transfer capability in plug-in electric cars (V2G(3) , G2V(4)) and electric vehicles are an option. In this study, the benefits of two wind and solar resources are compared in a weak low-voltage distribution system, and it is demonstrated that using these two resources together may overcome the problems of generating renewable resources with a stochastic nature. An uneven power distribution, the behavior of the grid at the PCC5 in the presence of a wind turbine, solar generator, and electric vehicle was also studied. Finally, the stability of transients has been investigated under various fault situations. The DIgSILENT PowerFactory program is used to run simulations.

As the design of these networks require the use of discrete variables and non-linear equations, it is a complex problem, being metaheuristics the most suitable techniques to solve them. In this study, simulated annealing is used to solve two well-known networks, Alperovits and Hanoi.

This is accomplished if a given system of reactions with known reaction kinetic models and feedstock is available. This paper shows experimentally how the geometry of a two-dimensional attainable region can be generated by reaction and mixing as the only fundamental processes occurring in the reactor of a hydrolysis process without taking the reaction kinetic model of the process into consideration. The experiment was conducted using an adiabatic batch reactor fitted with a thermistor for temperature measurement. The results were used to develop a novel technique to run the adiabatic batch reactor by applying the attainable region analysis. From the analysis the production rate of the product and the process time of the adiabatic batch reactor were optimized by graphical techniques, and it is shown that the maximum production rate increased by 72% as compared with the standard method of operating the batch reactor and the corresponding minimized process time was reduced to 0.36 h compared with 1.26 h of the standard batch operation. It is also shown that the limit of the optimization process generated the optimal process configuration required for a continuous operation to achieve the highest production rate in a minimum time possible.

I. Fast Computational Strategies for Large-Scale Problems	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH					International-Mexican Congress on Chemical Reaction Engineering (IMCCRE)	JUN 06-10, 2010	Ixtapa Zihuatanejo, MEXICO					In this paper, we address the optimization of industrial gas distribution systems, which consist of plants and customers, as well as storage tanks, trucks, and trailers. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is presented to minimize the total capital and operating costs, and to integrate short-term distribution planning decisions for the vehicle routing with long-term inventory decisions for sizing storage tanks at customer locations, In order to optimize asset allocation in the industrial gas distribution network by incorporating operating decisions, the model also takes into account the synergies among delivery schedule, tank sizes, customer locations, and inventory profiles. To effectively solve large-scale instances, we propose two fast computational strategies. The first approach is a two-level solution strategy based on the decomposition of the full-scale MILP model into an upper level route selection-tank sizing Model and a lower level reduced routing model. The second approach is based on a continuous approximation method, which estimates the operational cost at the strategic level and determines the trade-off with the capital cost from tank sizing. Three case studies including instances with up to 200 customers are presented to illustrate the applications of the Models and the performance of the proposed solution methods.

Two separate nonlinear gains, together with an unknown linear dynamical system, construct the nonlinear model (NM) of the piezoelectric actuator systems. A nonlinear inverse control (NIC) according to the learned NM is then designed to compensate the hysteretic phenomenon and to track the reference input without the risk of discontinuous response. Because the uncertainties are dynamic, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with residue compensation is employed to model them in a compact subset.

This paper deals with the problem of iterative learning controller design for linear discrete time systems with missing measurements. The missing measurements will happen at any sample time, and the probability of the occurrence of missing data is assumed to be known. The iterative learning controller is developed to guarantee the convergence of the tracking error and with quadratic performance index. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed design approach.																					1-4244-0331-6				2006							3748	+																WOS:000241773204058

Event-Triggered Discrete-Time Cubature Kalman Filter for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems With Packet Dropout	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												We propose a design framework for discrete-time event-triggered cubature Kalman filter for nonlinear dynamic systems over a wireless network with packet dropout. The design ensures that the prediction error covariance is bounded when packet delivery rate has a lower bound. We then show that the estimation error can be guaranteed to be bounded by properly tuning the threshold of the event-triggered mechanism.

However, this self-organization behavior may result in excessive phase separation with electron donors and thereby deteriorate device efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate an effective approach to tune the molecular organization of a fluorinated NFA (INPIC-4F), and its phase separation with the donor PBDB-T, by varying the casting solvent. A prolonged film drying time encourages the crystallization of INPIC-4F into spherulites and consequently results in excessive phase separation, leading to a low device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.1%. Contrarily, a drying time leads to fine mixed domains with inefficient charge transport properties, resulting in a moderate device PCE of 11.4%. An intermediate film drying time results in the formation of face-on pi-pi stacked PBDB-T and INPIC-4F domains with continuous phase-separated networks, which facilitates light absorption, exciton dissociation as well as balanced charge transport towards the electrode, and achieves a remarkable PCE of 13.1%. This work provides a rational guide for optimizing the molecular ordering of NFAs and electron donors for high device efficiency.

Nevertheless, currently available methods are labor intensive or too complex for field applications. Here, we report the design and performance of the first fully automated portable carbonate ion analyzer. Measurements are based on reaction of carbonate and chloride ions with Pb(II) followed by quantitative UV spectrophotometric detection of the PbCO30 complex. The core hardware is a syringe pump equipped with a multi-position valve that is controlled by software written in LabVIEW. Measurement precision is 1.1% (n = 13) with a measurement frequency of 12 h(-1). The analyzer was used to continuously monitor carbonate ion concentration variations in a 2500 L coral reef tank for five days (test 1), and used for shipboard underway and vertical profile analysis during a 13-day cruise (test 2). The analyzer attained a combined standard uncertainty of 3.0%, which meets the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network's "weather level" goal. Through use of a syringe pump mechanism for mixing seawater and reagent solution, the analyzer is robust, functionally flexible, and quite suitable for continuous environmental monitoring under harsh conditions.

Multi-drug combinations cannot be practically elucidated using conventional devices owing to structural limitations or operational complexity. 3D printing has recently attracted attention as a way to fabricate complicated and interconnected microfluidic channels, which is of design flexibility. Here, an easy-to-use, high-throughput, multi-drug combinations 3D printed microfluidic chips were brought forward. 36 discrete concentration combinations have been generated by repeated splitting-and-mixing of four inlet drugs in interconnected network channels, which are used to determine the optimal concentration of inhibition of cancer cells survival. We evaluate the potential to advance multi-drug combinations efficiency by optimizing the geometric parameters of tree-shaped branch unit, as well as the chip performance by dye visualization. The microfluidic chip was further applied to study multidrug combinations responses, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay was employed to test the cytotoxic effect of four drugs combinations on A549. The experiment results demonstrated clinically relevant antagonistic, synergistic interactions between the four different antitumor drugs. Moreover, this chip has outstanding features, e.g., more compact structure, more accurate combination of concentrations, greater space for scalability. As such, it will be an effective multi-drug combinations screening platform for applications in biomedical research and clinical medicine.

Confocal microscope is used to observe the mixing and fluid motion in the microchannel. We observed the evolution of Dean vortices along the spiral inlet channel and the disruption of stream boundary at the expansion chamber which are further pulled along the outlet spiral channel resulting in higher mixing efficiency compared to that without chamber Laminar flow of two fluids still maintained at the end of the normal spiral networks but the perfect mixing can be achieved at a given flow rates (Re of 15 to 45) from our design. Furthermore, uniform mixing can be obtained even at the spiral channel with shorter channel length. Unlike other complex designs, the design of the expansion chamber does not increase the pressure drop of the microchannel system and its dimension is larger than that of the main channel allowing to be fabricated by using conventional fabrication approach.

Through partitioning delay intervals [0, tau(m)] and [tau(m), tau(M)], respectively, and choosing an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the delay-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained by using free-weighting matrix and convex combination methods. These criteria are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and their feasibility can be easily checked by resorting to LMI in Matlab Toolbox in Ref. 1. The activation functions are not required to be differentiable or strictly monotonic, which generalizes those earlier forms. As an extension, we further consider the robust stability of discrete-time delayed Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed results is further illustrated by three numerical examples in comparison with the reported ones.																			0129-0657					AUG	2009	19	4					269	283		10.1142/S0129065709002038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0129065709002038								19731400					WOS:000269527600004

These evolve from a structure covering uniformly a continuous space towards an optimal design in terms of optimal transport theory. At convergence, the networks should optimize the way resources are transported through it. As the network structure shapes in time towards optimality, its topological properties also change with it. The question is how do these change as we reach optimality. We study the behavior of various network properties on a number of network sequences evolving towards optimal design and find that the transport cost function converges earlier than network properties and that these monotonically decrease. This suggests a mechanism for designing optimal networks by compressing dense structures. We find a similar behavior in networks extracted from real images of the networks designed by the body shape of a slime mold evolving in time.

Distributed IMA and distributed mixed criticality system are related concepts which help to address rising complexity in integrated systems. Distributed IMA offers all benefits of IMA, but for completely distributed systems. This closes the gap between federated and integrated modular architectures. Ethernet networks with time-triggered services (SAE AS6802) enable robust bandwidth partitioning and enable standard asynchronous and TDM-style communication, which is the key to integration of hard real-time controls, audio, video and other non-critical functions in one networked system. In our view, time-triggered services enable application of Ethernet for any type of critical embedded system.																					978-1-4244-4077-1				2009							206	215																WOS:000279662700021

In this study, rather than focusing on modifying a specific model, we studied the performance of different calculation structures in a multi-objective optimization framework. The Hydraulic and Risk Combined Model (HRCM) combines hydraulic performance and pipe breaking risk in a drainage system to provide optimal rehabilitation strategies. We evaluated different framework structures for the HRCM model. The results showed that the conventional framework structure used in engineering optimization research, which includes (1) constraint functions; (2) objective functions; and (3) multi-objective optimization, is inefficient for drainage rehabilitation problem. It was shown that the conventional framework can be significantly improved in terms of calculation speed and cost-effectiveness by removing the constraint function and adding more objective functions. The results indicated that the model performance improved remarkably, while the calculation speed was not changed substantially. In addition, we found that the mixed-integer optimization can decrease the optimization performance compared to using continuous variables and adding a post-processing module at the last stage to remove the unsatisfying results. This study (i) highlights the importance of the framework structure inefficiently solving engineering problems, and (ii) provides a simplified efficient framework for engineering optimization problems.

The objective of this paper is to create an agent-based modeling framework to evaluate the impact of the vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) technology on the mobility performance (i.e., travel time and its reliability) of a two-lane highway work zone scenario. This paper studies when and at what MP will the mobility benefits of connected vehicles emerge. Results showed that the mobility benefits are highly dependent on the CVs MP levels and traffic flow rates. In addition, the study found that the higher the traffic flow rate is, the higher MP level is required to enable the mobility benefits in the mixed traffic environment. Research findings will inform agency professionals, traffic engineers, and planners the achievable benefits that could accompany the implementation of CV technologies in diverse roadway settings such as work zone. Moreover, the results will help the decision-makers in agencies as state DOTs to develop effective resource allocation strategies and evaluate the cost and benefit ratio of deploying this technology in highway work zone scenario.

Ensuring cost-efficient and energy-efficient network design requires novel approaches that optimize across all network layers. Therefore, to moderate the growth of operators' expenses, in this paper, we investigate low-cost and energy-efficient cross-layer deployment of hierarchical optical transport network (OTN) boards minimizing equipment and energy consumption cost in mixed 10G and 100G/200G filterless metro networks. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model and a genetic algorithm (GA) approach that decide: (i) the node structure by deploying various stacked OTN boards (performing traffic-grooming at the electrical layer) and (ii) lightpath establishment considering coherent and non-coherent transmission technologies.

Heat integration in water allocation networks is also addressed through nonisothermal mixing of streams, and this is formulated as a discontinuous nonlinear programming problem. Utility requirements, for isothermal as well as for nonisothermal mixing, are compared over a range of minimum approach temperatures to evaluate the energy performance using illustrative examples.

This study presents a new method for concrete mixture design by combining artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithms (GA), and Scipy libraries for hybrid intelligent modeling. This method enables the prediction of concrete mechanical properties and the optimization of mix proportions with single or multi-objective goals. The GA is used to optimize the structure and weight parameters of ANN to improve prediction accuracy and generalization ability (R-2 > 0.95, RMSE and MAE < 10). Then, the Scipy library combined with GA-ANN is used for the multi-objective optimization of concrete mix proportions to balance the compressive strength and costs of concrete. Moreover, an AI-based concrete mix proportion design system is developed, utilizing a user-friendly GUI to meet specific strength requirements and adapt to practical needs.

Its concurrent and non-deterministic nature makes its analysis and design very complex. These systems can develop through different states and as a consequence of its magnitude is possible that the system has states unconsidered during the design phases that lead it to an undesirable performance. According to the above in this paper we have made several contributions aimed in to developing a procedure for modeling and analyzing discrete event systems that integrate wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN) by using Colored Petri Nets (CPN) models, in order of to establish a method for designing plans to minimize the time sequence of tasks execution and to fulfil with safety requirements ensuring absence of locks, process overflows, and unwanted presence of mutual exclusion conditions on the use of shared resources.

Often, a real-world diffusion cannot be directly observed while it is occurring - perhaps it is not noticed until some time has passed, continuous monitoring is too costly, or privacy concerns limit data access. This leads to the need to reconstruct how the present state of the diffusion came to be from partial diffusion data. Here, we tackle the problem of reconstructing a diffusion history from one or more snapshots of the diffusion state. This ability can be invaluable to learn when certain computer nodes are infected or which people are the initial disease spreaders to control future diffusions. We formulate this problem over discrete-time SEIRS-type diffusion models in terms of maximum likelihood. We design methods that are based on submodularity and a novel prizecollecting dominating-set vertex cover (PCDSVC) relaxation that can identify likely diffusion steps with some provable performance guarantees. Our methods are the first to be able to reconstruct complete diffusion histories accurately in real and simulated situations. As a special case, they can also identify the initial spreaders better than existing methods for that problem. Our results for both meme and contaminant diffusion show that the partial diffusion data problem can be overcome with proper modeling and methods, and that hidden temporal characteristics of diffusion can be predicted from limited data.					sefer, emre/AAY-2245-2020	sefer, emre/0000-0002-9186-0270													1550-4786		978-1-4799-4303-6				2014							530	539		10.1109/ICDM.2014.135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2014.135													WOS:000389267400054

Due to the profile of the cutting edge could not be expressed with definite mathematics formulas, the nonlinear mapped characteristics of BP neural network were used to simulate the cutting edge in the method. The results indicated that this method not only accurately simulated the discrete coordinates to fulfill the task of accurate irregular cutting edge design, furthermore, the design of cutting edge was optimized, the accurate design of complicated irregular cutting edge with the aid of computer was fully achieved.

Here, a new catalyst architecture comprising a nanoneedle network of iridium-containing oxides assembled into macroporous micrometric particles with approximate to 75% of porosity is reported. The rationally designed porous hierarchical structure optimizes the accessibility of reactants and products to the surface of the nanoparticles and maximizes catalyst activity. The materials are easily prepared from aqueous solutions by an industrially viable spray-drying route through an evaporation self-assembly mechanism. The versatility of the process enables the preparation of mixed oxides with low iridium content, particles with tunable crystallinity, and various iridium surface species with high electrochemical activity. Highly porous Ir0.7Ru0.3O2 outperforms commercial iridium oxide. These materials also represent an ideal platform to assess the reactivity of the iridium and oxygen species involved in the oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that these highly porous particles are optimal building blocks to be integrated into catalyst layers, without the drawbacks associated with the use of discrete nanoparticles. Fresh- and end-of-test membrane-electrode assemblies' characterization shows that their particular architecture is preserved upon catalyst layer preparation and after operation in a proton-exchange membrane electrolysis cell.

J	Guo, K; Pan, YP				Guo, Kai; Pan, Yongping			Composite adaptation and learning for robot control: A survey	ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL												Composite adaptation and learning techniques were initially proposed for improving parameter convergence in adaptive control and have generated considerable research interest in the last three decades, inspiring numerous robot control applications. The key idea is that more sources of parametric information are applied to drive parameter estimates aside from trajectory tracking errors. Both composite adaptation and learning can ensure superior stability and performance. However, composite learning possesses a unique feature in that online data memory is fully exploited to extract parametric information such that parameter convergence can be achieved without a stringent condition termed persistent excitation. In this article, we provide the first systematic and comprehensive survey of prevalent composite adaptation and learning approaches for robot control, especially focusing on exponential parameter convergence. Composite adaptation is classified into regressor-filtering composite adaptation and error-filtering composite adaptation, and composite learning is classified into discrete-data regressor extension and continuous-data regressor extension. For the sake of clear presentation and better understanding, a general class of robotic systems is applied as a unifying framework to show the motivation, synthesis, and characteristics of each parameter estimation method for adaptive robot control. The strengths and deficiencies of all these methods are also discussed sufficiently. We have concluded by suggesting possible directions for future research in this area.

We first analyze the limiting behavior of this model and derive the two asymptotically optimal configurations of facilities: one of these configurations is the well studied honeycomb heuristic, and the other is an Archimedean spiral. We then give a fast constant-factor approximation algorithm for finding the placement of a set of facilities in any convex polygon that minimizes the sum of the three aforementioned costs.																			0041-1655					AUG	2015	49	3					433	451		10.1287/trsc.2013.0511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2013.0511													WOS:000359425900001

J	Dukkanci, O; Kara, BY; Bektas, T				Dukkanci, Okan; Kara, Bahar Y.; Bektas, Tolga			The green location-routing problem	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												This paper introduces the Green Location-Routing Problem (GLRP), a combination of the classical Location-Routing Problem (LRP) and the Pollution-Routing Problem (PRP). The GLRP consists of (i) locating depots on a subset of a discrete set of points, from where vehicles of limited capacity will be dispatched to serve a number of customers with service requirements, (ii) routing the vehicles by determining the order of customers served by each vehicle and (iii) setting the speed on each leg of the journey such that customers are served within their respective time windows. The objective of the GLRP is to minimize a cost function comprising the fixed cost of operating depots, as well as the costs of the fuel and CO2 emissions. The amount of fuel consumption and emissions is measured by a widely used comprehensive modal emission model. The paper presents a mixed integer programming formulation and a set of preprocessing rules and valid inequalities to strengthen the formulation. Two solution approaches; an integer programming based algorithm and an iterated local search algorithm are also presented. Computational analyses are carried out using adaptations of literature instances to the GLRP in order to analyze the effects of a number parameters on location and routing decisions in terms of cost, fuel consumption and emission. The performance of the heuristic algorithms are also evaluated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This CZM constitutive model, which is formulated in terms of S-N stress-life curves rather than the more usual rates of crack propagation described with a Paris law, can predict both crack initiation and propagation by relying on the intrinsic relationships between S-N and the Paris law. This feature of the model is of significant practical interest since S-N curves can be synthesized with few parameters and simple engineering assumptions, while the experimental characterization of the Paris law parameters for all required stress ratios, mode mixities, and material interfaces in a composite structure is very difficult and often impractical. Used in combination with the Rx-FEM method, this CZM can predict mesh-independent crack networks in composite structures subjected to cyclic or quasi-static loads. The Rx-FEM methodology for fatigue damage was implemented in Abaqus using two superimposed sets of standard Abaqus elements to represent the enriched displacement field. The capabilities of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by comparing the experimental and predicted response of a mixed-mode bending (MMB) test, as well as a Clamped Tapered Beam (CTB) sub-element designed to study matrix crack initiation, delamination propagation, and subsequent delamination migration from one ply interface to another.

J	Yu, GD; Haskell, WB; Liu, Y				Yu, Guodong; Haskell, William B.; Liu, Yang			Resilient facility location against the risk of disruptions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												In this paper, we consider an uncapacitated facility location problem (RUFL) with random facility disruptions. We develop risk-averse optimization formulations to compute resilient location and customer assignment solutions for two cases (i.e., under either independent or correlated disruptions), where the risks are expressed through a family of risk measures including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and absolute-semideviation (ASD). The risk-averse RUFL with independent facility disruptions is to control the risks at each individual customer and modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, which is challenging to be solved. In response, we develop a branch-and-cut algorithm combined with augmented Lagrangian decomposition for globally optimizing the problem. As for the risk averse RUFL with correlated facility disruptions, we propose a scenario-based model to minimize the total fixed costs and risks across the entire customer set. The resulting formulation is a pure MILP and a Lagrangian decomposition scheme is proposed for computational aspects in large-scale cases. Our numerical results show that the risk-averse models outperform the classic risk-neutral models in improving the reliability. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithms perform well. To conclude, we extract managerial insights that suggest important guidelines for controlling risk in the face of disruption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two types of random number generators were taken into account: discrete and continuous. Different combinations between the dimensionality property and the number of function evaluation setting were tested on: i) a set of benchmark functions from the CEC 2013 special session on real parameter optimization; and ii) 2 chemical engineering problems (optimal operation of an alkylation unit and heat exchanger network design). Also, a comparison with other optimizers was performed. It was found that, in similar conditions, the performance of the algorithm (in terms of the best solutions) varies substantially depending on the distribution used. In case of the benchmark problems, the best solutions were obtained for Binomial and Weibull distribution. For the separable functions is was observed that, indifferent of the distribution used, the algorithm was not able to find acceptable solution within the constraint represented by the number of function evaluations. In the case of the alkylation problem the best solutions were obtained by the Weibull distribution, the performance of the Differential Search algorithm being comparable to other optimizers such as Differential Evolution. In the case of the heat exchanger, three different distribution provided near optimal solutions (Binomial, ChiSquare and Weibull). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Firstly, a event-triggered control policy is proposed based on the quantized state of the system model. Then, by using linear matrix inequality method, a new co-design algorithm for the parameter of event-triggered mechanism and state feedback controller is presented. In addition, based on Bernoulli binary distribution model, a mean square asymptotical stability condition is proposed for the obtained controller when there exits packet dropout phenomenon. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by some numerical simulations.

J	Li, SZ; Chen, S				Li, Suzhen; Chen, Shu			Field monitoring and prediction on temperature distribution of glass curtain walls of a super high-rise building	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES												Temperature action has a significant effect on the behavior of a supertall structure but has rarely been investigated due to lack of knowledge on the actual temperature measurements. It would be of great significance to predict the time-pace temperature distribution of a high-rise building by using the general environmental monitoring data which is more easily acquired and has a close relation with structural thermal action. In this study, the actual temperature distribution of the exterior glass curtain wall of Shanghai Tower is investigated using the field monitoring data achieved by the integrated real-time Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system installed on the tower. The data recorded during 2018.1.1-2018.10.13 (283 days) are employed. A data-driven model is developed based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is capable of predicting the temperature distribution of the curtain wall by using the environmental monitoring data including the wind velocity and direction measurements as well as the public weather information. Compared with the discrete temperature measurements at a few limited locations, the proposed model provides continuous time-space temperature distribution of the curtain wall, which adds insights into the knowledge of temperature actions for the maintenance of the Shanghai Tower and the design of glass curtain wall of a supertall structure.																			0141-0296	1873-7323				JAN 1	2022	250								113405	10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.113405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.113405		OCT 2021											WOS:000712162400002

Nonlinear Network Optimization-An Embedding Vector Space Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION												This paper proposes a normed-space vector representation of networks which allows de. ning evolutionary operators for network optimization that resemble continuous-space operators. These operators are employed here to build a genetic algorithm which becomes generic for the optimization of tree networks, without the requirement of any special encoding scheme. Such a genetic algorithm has been compared with several encoding-based genetic algorithms, on 25 and 50-node instances of the optimal communication spanning tree and of the quadratic minimum spanning tree, and has been shown to outperform all other algorithms in a stochastic dominance analysis. The proposed approach has also been applied to an electric power distribution network design (a multibranch problem), outperforming the results presented in a former reference (which have been obtained with an Ant Colony algorithm). The results of some landscape dispersion analysis suggest that the proposed normed-space network vector representation is analogous to some continuous-variable space dilation operations, which define favorable space coordinates for optimization.

The hybrid tree-structured network representation suggests that terminal harmonics with non-multiple frequencies may enter polynomial function nodes as variables. The harmonics with non-multiple, irregular frequencies axe derived analytically using the discrete Fourier transform. The development of polynomial harmonic GP includes also design of a regularized statistical fitness function for improved search control and overfitting avoidance. Empirical results show that this hybrid version outperforms the previous GP system manipulating polynomials STROGANOFF, the traditional Koza-style GP, and the harmonic GMDH network algorithm on processing time series.																					0-7803-6657-3				2001							267	274																WOS:000172263900038
J	Feng, XC; Han, JK; Zhang, R; Xu, S; Xia, H				Feng, Xuecai; Han, Jikai; Zhang, Rui; Xu, Shuo; Xia, Hui			Security defense strategy algorithm for Internet of Things based on deep reinforcement learning	HIGH-CONFIDENCE COMPUTING												Currently, important privacy data of the Internet of Things (IoT) face extremely high risks of leakage. Attackers persistently engage in continuous attacks on terminal devices to obtain private data of crucial importance. Although significant progress has been made in recent years in deep reinforcement learning defense strategies, most defense methods still face problems such as low defense resource allocation efficiency and insufficient defense coordination capabilities. To solve the above problems, this paper constructs a novel adversarial security scenario and proposes a security game model that integrates defense resource allocation and patrol inspection. Regarding the above game model, this paper designs a deep reinforcement learning algorithm named SDSA to calculate its security defense strategy. SDSA calculates the allocation strategy of the best patrolling strategy that is most suitable for the defender by searching the policy on a multi-dimensional discrete action space, and enables multiple defense agents to cooperate efficiently by training a multi-intelligent Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) with prioritized experience replay. Finally, the experimental results show that the SDSA-learned security defense strategy can provide a feasible and effective security protection strategy for defenders against attacks compared to the MADDPG and OptGradFP methods.

J	Yu, H				Yu, Hao			Modeling a remanufacturing reverse logistics planning problem: some insights into disruptive technology adoption	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY												Remanufacturing is the process to restore the functionality of high-value end-of-life (EOL) products, which is considered a substantial link in reverse logistics systems for value recovery. However, due to the uncertainty of the reverse material flow, the planning of a remanufacturing reverse logistics system is complex. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of disruptive technologies in Industry 4.0/5.0, e.g., the Internet of things (IoT), smart robots, cloud-based digital twins, and additive manufacturing, has shown great potential for a smart paradigm transition of remanufacturing reverse logistics operations. In this paper, a new mixed-integer program is modeled for supporting several tactical decisions in remanufacturing reverse logistics, i.e., remanufacturing setups, production planning and inventory levels, core acquisition and transportation, and remanufacturing line balancing and utilization. The model is further extended by incorporating utilization-dependent nonlinear idle time cost constraints and stochastic takt time to accommodate different real-world scenarios. Through a set of numerical experiments, the influences of different demand patterns and idle time constraints are revealed. The potential impacts of disruptive technology adoption in remanufacturing reverse logistics are also discussed from managerial perspectives, which may help remanufacturing companies with a smart and smooth transition in the Industry 4.0/5.0 era.

J	Parichatprecha, R; Nimityongskul, P				Parichatprecha, Rattapoohm; Nimityongskul, Pichai			An integrated approach for optimum design of HPC mix proportion using genetic algorithm and artificial neural networks	COMPUTERS AND CONCRETE												This study aims to develop a cost-based high-performance concrete (HPC) mix optimization system based on an integrated approach using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GA). ANNs are used to predict the three main properties of HPC, namely workability, strength and durability, which are used to evaluate fitness and constraint violations in the GA process. Multilayer back-propagation neural networks are trained using the results obtained from experiments and previous research. The correlation between concrete components and its properties is established. GA is employed to arrive at an optimal mix proportion of HPC by minimizing its total cost. A system prototype, called High Performance Concrete Mix-Design System using Genetic Algorithm and Neural Networks (HPCGANN), was developed in MATLAB. The architecture of the proposed system consists of three main parts: 1) User interface; 2) ANNs prediction models software; and 3) GA engine software. The validation of the proposed system is carried out by comparing the results obtained from the system with the trial batches. The results indicate that the proposed system can be used to enable the design of HPC mix which corresponds to its required performance. Furthermore, the proposed system takes into account the influence of the fluctuating unit price of materials in order to achieve the lowest cost of concrete, which cannot be easily obtained by traditional methods or trial-and-error techniques.																			1598-8198	1598-818X				JUN	2009	6	3					253	268																WOS:000267324800005

Attention is focused on the design of a state estimator to estimate the neuron states, through available output measurements. First, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to establish sufficient conditions for the existence of admissible state estimators. These conditions are expressed in the form of LMIs, which guarantee the estimation error to be globally exponentially stable in the presence of time-varying delays. Then, the desired estimator matrix gain is characterized in terms of the solution to these LMIs. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

This idea may be a state-of-the-art interpretation of a method game. Each player has an accurate prediction of other players' behavior and acts consistent with such a rational prediction. This paper aims to apply the game theory idea of equilibrium as a decision-making tool to develop a simple method for solving a multi-objective decision-making problem with any number of players to achieve an equilibrium point. Game theory and Nash equilibrium have been used to determine the equilibrium point of multi-objective decision-making problems of production planning in non-cooperative environments. A mixed and conditional N-player model was proposed as a development of the Nash model. The method was applied to a second-square planning problem with multiple constrained objectives (with linear constraints) in order to allocate a larger share of the sales market in a situation where all objectives were in conflict with each other. Effective solutions were first obtained using the b(l) constraint method, and then, an effective equilibrium point was extracted using the proposed method. Since the problem-solving method was discrete, the effective equilibrium point was reduced, and the results were used for making decisions about six products in the competitive market.																			1432-7643	1433-7479				MAR	2023	27	6					3151	3167		10.1007/s00500-022-07507-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-022-07507-9		OCT 2022											WOS:000874473700002

We observe a distinct gas invasion pattern, where gas progresses through the pore space in the form of disconnected clusters mediated by double and multiple displacement events. Gas advances in a process we name three-phase Haines jumps, during which gas re-arranges its configuration in the pore space, retracting from some regions to enable the rapid filling of multiple pores. The gas retraction leads to a permanent disconnection of gas ganglia, which do not reconnect as gas injection proceeds. We observe, in situ, the direct displacement of oil and water by gas as well as gas-oil-water double displacement. The use of local in situ measurements and an energy balance approach to determine fluid-fluid contact angles alongside the quantification of capillary pressures and pore occupancy indicate that the wettability order is oil-gas-water from most to least wetting. Furthermore, quantifying the evolution of Minkowski functionals implied well-connected oil and water, while the gas connectivity decreased as gas was broken up into discrete clusters during injection. This work can be used to design CO2 storage, improved oil recovery and microfluidic devices.

J	Arashpour, M; Arashpour, M				Arashpour, Mohammadreza; Arashpour, Mehrdad			Analysis of Workflow Variability and Its Impacts on Productivity and Performance in Construction of Multistory Buildings	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING												The meeting of milestones presents a constant challenge in construction projects. One root cause behind this challenge is the presence of variability in the project workflow. In fact, impacts of variability at both the trade contractor level and project level remain difficult to manage. This paper aims to analyze impacts of variability in the workflow caused by rework and fluctuating work quantities. Toward this end, production data of two residential construction companies were collected, and a mixed method of mathematical and simulation modeling was used to analyze performance and productivity at both the trade and project levels. Performance metrics such as completion times, work-in-process levels, and delays were then measured in different real-life production scenarios. The findings clearly show that the workflow variability significantly downgrades performance metrics by causing inflated completion times, longer queues of uncompleted jobs, and excessive delays, resulting in productivity loss. The paper provides those who manage construction projects with recommendations on stabilizing the workflow in the interconnected network of trade contractors to improve productivity and performance. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in engineering management by enhancing the insight into workflow variability and its impacts on tangible performance measures.

However, the data model and storage architecture of these systems are significantly different than those in use today. We developed a data acquisition and signal analysis platform using a relatively inexpensive cluster of commodity computing hardware running a Hadoop Distributed File System, an Accumulo database infrastructure, and the Zeppelin web-based analytics tool suite. The Accumulo data model allows individual waveform samples and their associated metadata to be stored as discrete rows in the database. This is a significant departure from traditional storage practices, in which continuous waveform segments are stored with their associated metadata as a single entity. Our design allows for rapid table scans of large data archives within the Accumulo database for locating, retrieving, and analyzing specific waveform segments directly. The system infrastructure is horizontally scalable, which allows additional data acquisition and processing resources to be added simply through the addition of new data nodes. Easy scalability permits the system to accommodate the ingestion and analysis of new data as the network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic sensors grows. The barrier of entry for establishing a functional data acquisition system is relatively low for which a proof of concept prototype can be developed on a limited budget and later scaled as storage and processing requirements dictate.																			0895-0695	1938-2057				NOV-DEC	2017	88	6					1553	1559		10.1785/0220170056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0220170056													WOS:000416303100017
J	Genç, I; Güzelis, C				Genc, Ibrahim; Guzelis, Cuneyt			A convergent algorithm for a cascade network of multiplexed dual output discrete perceptrons for linearly nonseparable classification	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES												In this paper a new discrete perceptron model is introduced. The model forms a cascade structure and it is capable of realizing an arbitrary classification task designed by a constructive learning algorithm. The main idea is to copy a discrete perceptron neuron's output to have a complementary dual output for the neuron, and then to select, by using a multiplexer, the true output, which might be 0 or 1 depending on the given input. Hence, the problem of realization of the desired output is transformed into the realization of the selector signal of the multiplexer. In the next step, the selector signal is taken as the desired output signal for the remaining part of the network. The repeated applications of the procedure render the problem into a linearly separable one and eliminate the necessity of using the selector signal in the last step of the algorithm. The proposed modification to the discrete perceptron brings universality with the expense of getting just a slight modification in hardware implementation.

The hybrid tree-structured network representation suggests that terminal harmonies with non-multiple frequencies may enter polynomial function nodes as variables. The harmonics with non-multiple, irregular frequencies are derived analytically using the discrete Fourier transform. The development of polynomial harmonic GP includes also design of a regularized statistical fitness function for improved search control and overfitting avoidance. Empirical results show that this hybrid version outperforms the previous GP system manipulating polynomials STROGANOFF, the traditional Koza-style GP, and the harmonic GMDH network algorithm on processing time series.																					0-7803-6657-3				2001							902	909																WOS:000172263900125

The calibration targets include initial damage, failure mode, and mechanical properties of the material. The research utilise 243 training datasets generated through orthogonal experimental design and conducted simulations to train the BP neural network. In addition, a parameter sensitivity analysis is employed on the trained BP neural network to quantify the impact level of each microparameter and guide future macroparameter fine-tuning. The results indicate that the mean absolute percentage error of the BP-PSO inversion method is only 3.79%. This research also study on the concrete failure mechanism by using a mesoscale model based on clustered-particle logic, which considered concrete as a three-phase composite composed of mortar matrix, aggregates, and interfacial transition zone. The crack initiation, propagation and coalescence of DEM model show a good agreement with the experimental results.																			0013-7944	1873-7315				NOV 15	2023	292								109659	10.1016/j.engfracmech.2023.109659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engfracmech.2023.109659		OCT 2023											WOS:001096006300001
J	He, H; Varshney, PK				He, Hao; Varshney, Pramod K.			Fusing Censored Dependent Data for Distributed Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING												In this paper, we consider a distributed detection problem for a censoring sensor network where each sensor's communication rate is significantly reduced by transmitting only "informative" observations to the Fusion Center (FC), and censoring those deemed "uninformative". While the independence of data from censoring sensors is often assumed in previous research, we explore spatial dependence among observations. Our focus is on designing the fusion rule under the Neyman-Pearson (NP) framework that takes into account the spatial dependence among observations. Two transmission scenarios are considered: one where uncensored observations are transmitted directly to the FC, and second where they are first quantized and then transmitted to further improve transmission efficiency. Copula-based Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) for censored data is proposed with both continuous and discrete messages received at the FC corresponding to different transmission strategies. We address the computational issues of the copula-based GLRTs involving multidimensional integrals by presenting more efficient fusion rules, based on the key idea of injecting controlled noise at the FC before fusion. Although, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reduced by introducing controlled noise at the receiver, simulation results demonstrate that the resulting noise-aided fusion approach based on adding artificial noise performs very closely to the exact copula-based GLRTs. Copula-based GLRTs and their noise-aided counterparts by exploiting the spatial dependence greatly improve detection performance compared with the fusion rule under independence assumption.																			1053-587X	1941-0476				AUG 15	2015	63	16					4385	4395		10.1109/TSP.2015.2439231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2439231													WOS:000357778600019

Mixing in the NETmix Reactor	FRONTIERS IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												NETmix is a static mixing reactor composed of a network of mixing chambers interconnected by channels. The repetitive mixing pattern inside the reactor enables the use of reduced geometries to represent the NETmix network, such as the ExtendedNUB model, used in this work. Mixing in NETmix is based on the impingement of jets, issuing from channels. Inside the chambers, the jets are engulfed by dynamic vortices which can be quantified using Lagrangian techniques. Batch Lagrangian Mixing Simulation (BLMS) is based on successive injections of particles to measure the fraction of the fluids at the outlet of the mixing chambers. The distribution of the outlet fraction of particles indicates that it is possible to have nearly perfect mixing inside the NETmix chambers, depending on the dimensions of the channels and chambers. The NETmix design is here optimized in relation to the chamber diameter to channel width ratio, D/d. Results from BLMS show that best performance in NETmix occurs for 6.65 = D/d = 6.85.

Despite being a multi-objective problem, most existing approaches treat feature selection as a single-objective optimization problem. Recently, Multi-objective Grey Wolf optimizer (MOGWO) was proposed to solve multi-objective optimization problem. However, MOGWO was originally designed for continuous optimization problems and hence, it cannot be utilized directly to solve multi-objective feature selection problems which are inherently discrete in nature. Therefore, in this research, a binary version of MOGWO based on sigmoid transfer function called BMOGW-S is developed to optimize feature selection problems. A wrapper based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to assess the classification performance of a subset of selected features. To validate the performance of the proposed method, 15 standard benchmark datasets from the UCI repository are employed. The proposed BMOGWO-S was compared with MOGWO with a tanh transfer function and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). The results showed that the proposed BMOGWO-S can effectively determine a set of non-dominated solutions. The proposed method outperforms the existing multi-objective approaches in most cases in terms of features reduction as well as classification error rate while benefiting from a lower computational cost.

By means of nonlocal version of N-fold Darboux transformation (DT) technique, discrete multi-soliton solutions in determinant form are constructed for the reverse space-time nonlocal nonlinear self-dual network equation. Through the asymptotic and graphic analysis, unstable soliton structures of one-, two- and three-soliton solutions are discussed graphically. We observe that the single components in this nonlocal equation display instability while the combined potential terms with nonlocal PT-symmetry show stable soliton structures. It is shown that these nonlocal solutions are clearly different from those of its corresponding local equation. The results given in this paper may explain the soliton propagation in electrical signals.																			0217-9849	1793-6640				JUL 10	2021	35	19							2150314	10.1142/S0217984921503140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217984921503140													WOS:000667726300001

However, although two different networks can coexist in a large-scale industrial complex, few studies have been conducted to develop an integrated utility supply and H-2 supply network (IUHSN) design in a techno-economic optimization framework. In this study, we design an IUHSN which includes a number of utilities (steam, water, and electricity), and H-2 sources (manufacturers) and sinks (end customers), Steam methane reforming (SMR) process is used as an intermediate linkage between both networks. To obtain an optimal design of the IUHSN reflecting the reality, we develop a mathematical model which is formulated as multi-period stochastic mixed integer linear programming concerning uncertain raw material prices. This model allows identification of a promising design strategy to minimize total supply cost, because sources and sinks can be connected to each other to transfer unused resources and products.

One common key issue regarding CLN resource combination is the network design optimization problem under discrete uncertainty (DU-CLNDOP). Operational environment changes and information uncertainty in network designs, due to partner selection, resource constrains and network robustness, must be effectively controlled from the system perspective. Therefore, a general two-stage quantitative framework that enables decision makers to select the optimal network design scheme for CLNs under uncertainty is proposed in this paper. Phase 1 calculates the simulation result of each hypothetical scenario of CLN resource combination using the expected value model with robust constraints. Phase 2 selects the optimal network design scheme for DU-CLNDOP using the orthogonal experiment design method. The validity of the model and method are verified via an illustrative example.

The optimal control problems are discretised by using a finite element method in time and space, then transcribed into a nonlinear programming problems. To find optimal controls and optimal trajectories ESNs adaptive critic designs are used to approximate co-state equations.

However, inversely mapping algorithm-trained physical model parameters onto real-world optical devices with discrete values is a non-trivial task as existing optical devices have non-unified discrete levels and non-monotonic properties. This work proposes a novel device-to-system hardware-software codesign framework, which enables efficient physics-aware training of DONNs w.r.t arbitrary experimental measured optical devices across layers. Specifically, Gumbel-Softmax is employed to enable differentiable discrete mapping from real-world device parameters into the forward function of DONNs, where the physical parameters in DONNs can be trained by simply minimizing the loss function of the ML task. The results have demonstrated that our proposed framework offers significant advantages over conventional quantization-based methods, especially with low-precision optical devices. Finally, the proposed algorithm is fully verified with physical experimental optical systems in low-precision settings.

Recent analysis of pit wall stability for the operating open pit at Diavik Diamond Mines has led to the exploration of new techniques to estimate the impact of intact rock bridges within pervasive fracture sets on the factor of safety for the pit slopes. The kimberlite pipes being mined from the A 154 pit are hosted in a strong, moderately fractured granitic rock mass. Although located within the zone of continuous permafrost, the pipes are being mined in unfrozen rock below the shallow waters of Lac De Gras. To facilitate mining from surface, a water containing dike was constructed and the lake above the pipes was dewatered prior to mining. Rock structure is comprised primarily of shallow and sub-vertical joints with an average continuity of less than 10 m and a relatively small proportion of structure that extends across benches. An assessment of the rock structure using the Discrete Fracture Network approach has suggested that the critical failure surface is a step-path type mechanism with shear along a combination of shallow joints, steep joints, and intact rock bridges. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the proportion of a failure surface that will require shearing through the rock mass, and simplified approaches to consider the impact of rock bridges on overall pit wall stability.																					978-0-415-44401-9				2007							1245	1250		10.1201/NOE0415444019-c154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/NOE0415444019-c154													WOS:000252215300154
J	Gnecco, G; Gori, M; Melacci, S; Sanguineti, M				Gnecco, Giorgio; Gori, Marco; Melacci, Stefano; Sanguineti, Marcello			Foundations of Support Constraint Machines	NEURAL COMPUTATION												The mathematical foundations of a new theory for the design of intelligent agents are presented. The proposed learning paradigm is centered around the concept of constraint, representing the interactions with the environment, and the parsimony principle. The classical regularization framework of kernel machines is naturally extended to the case in which the agents interact with a richer environment, where abstract granules of knowledge, compactly described by different linguistic formalisms, can be translated into the unified notion of constraint for defining the hypothesis set. Constrained variational calculus is exploited to derive general representation theorems that provide a description of the optimal body of the agent (i. e., the functional structure of the optimal solution to the learning problem), which is the basis for devising new learning algorithms. We show that regardless of the kind of constraints, the optimal body of the agent is a support constraint machine (SCM) based on representer theorems that extend classical results for kernel machines and provide new representations. In a sense, the expressiveness of constraints yields a semantic-based regularization theory, which strongly restricts the hypothesis set of classical regularization. Some guidelines to unify continuous and discrete computational mechanisms are given so as to accommodate in the same framework various kinds of stimuli, for example, supervised examples and logic predicates. The proposed view of learning from constraints incorporates classical learning from examples and extends naturally to the case in which the examples are subsets of the input space, which is related to learning propositional logic clauses.					; Gnecco, Giorgio/P-7623-2014	Sanguineti, Marcello/0000-0003-0355-8483; Gnecco, Giorgio/0000-0002-5427-4328; MELACCI, STEFANO/0000-0002-0415-0888													0899-7667	1530-888X				FEB	2015	27	2					388	480		10.1162/NECO_a_00686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00686								25380338					WOS:000348139300006
J	Wang, RQ; Li, JW; Bai, RB				Wang, Ruoqi; Li, Jiawei; Bai, Ruibin			Prediction and Analysis of Container Terminal Logistics Arrival Time Based on Simulation Interactive Modeling: A Case Study of Ningbo Port	MATHEMATICS												This study is a driving analysis of the transfer data of container terminals based on simulation interactive modeling technology. In the context of a container yard, a model was established to analyze and predict the arrival time and influencing factors of container transportation through the data from the control center of the yard. The economic benefit index in the index system was determined through expert consultation, the automatic terminal can be obtained by acquiring the actual operating parameters of the terminal, and the terminal to be built can be acquired mainly through simulation modeling. Therefore, when determining the design scheme before constructing the automated container terminal, a terminal simulation model needs to be established that meets the requirements of loading and unloading operations and terminal production operations. In addition, an automated container terminal simulation model needs to be implemented to verify the feasibility of the evaluation model. The results reveal that the accuracy of the current prediction model is still limited-the highest accuracy is only 72%, whether there are continuous or discrete variables, traffic or weather variables. Moreover, the study denotes that the relationship between weather and specific time factors and the arrival time of containers is weak, even negligible. This study provides guidance and decision-making support for the construction of automated terminals.

We introduce edge2vec, an edge representations framework for learning discrete and continuous features of edges in deep architecture. In edge2vec, we learn a mapping of edges associated with nodes where random samples are augmented by statistical and semantic representations of words and documents. We argue that infusing semantic representations of features for edges by exploiting word2vec and para2vec is the key to learning richer representations for exploring target nodes or labels in the hierarchy. Moreover, we design and implement a balanced stochastic dual coordinate ascent (DCA)-based support vector machine for speeding up training. We introduce a global decision-based top-down walks instead of random walks to predict the most likelihood labels in the deep architecture. We judge the efficiency of edge2vec over the existing state-of-the-art techniques on extreme multi-label hierarchical as well as flat classification tasks. The empirical results show that edge2vec is very promising and computationally very efficient in fast learning and predicting tasks. In deep learning workbench, edge2vec represents a new direction for statistical and semantic representations of features in task-independent networks.

J	Petrovsky, V				Petrovsky, Vitaly			Electrical properties of multicomponent CMM in correlation with their microstructure	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL												In this work, electrical properties (resistance, resistance temperature coefficient, thermoelectric voltage, current-voltage curve) of multicomponent ceramic matrix materials have been investigated. The influence of the structure of discrete particles on the microstructure and properties relations of CMM composites has been studied. Three groups of resistive materials were analyzed: (a) high resistance matrix and percolation clusters; (b) ionic or (c) covalent ceramic matrix and metal-like percolation clusters. The percolation threshold in composite materials is defined as the composition at which the conducting phase forms a continuous three-dimensional network through the material. However, in typical CMC we have observed a multi-threshold situation: at some content of conducting particles the first percolating clusters are formed; when the number of particles increases, clusters are destroyed to be created again at some higher content of conducting particles. These processes are strongly dependent on the starting materials properties, as well as on the thermal treatment of composites. Based on this approach a new product has been designed. Much attention was paid to the particulate structure and processing. A CMM with the resistance ratio R-800/R-20 = 1.4 has been manufactured. Intensive resistance growth begins at 700 degrees C and the maximum is achieved at 1100 degrees C. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

In view of this, we focus on the linear plants without unknown parameters and investigate the stabilization problem of networked control systems with noisy sampling intervals and stochastic time-varying delays. First, a closed-loop discrete-time stochastic system, whose system matrices are characterized by high nonlinearity and randomness, is obtained by considering the noisy sampling intervals and stochastic time-varying delays in a unified framework. Second, an equivalent yet tractable stochastic-augmented model is established with the aid of matrix exponential computation. With a confluent Vandermonde matrix associated with the minimal polynomial and Kronecker product operation, the mathematical expectation of a product of three matrices, including the system matrix of the stochastic-augmented model and its transpose, is calculated. Based on this, a stabilization controller is designed such that the stochastic stability of the original discrete-time stochastic system is guaranteed. Finally, an illustrative example with four different cases is provided to verify the effectiveness of the designed method.

In this paper, we study the wirelessly powered IoT networks, in which a central node transmits radio frequency (RF) energy to power the IoT sensors, and the sensors harvest RF power to transmit data back to the central node. In this IoT network, the sensors transmit data according to their energy utilization policies, and the central node allocates charging powers to all sensors. We design the sensor energy utilization policies and the power allocation among sensors by maximizing the total data throughput of the system. In particular, the subproblem of energy utilization policy design is formulated as a Markov decision process and the power allocation subproblem is formulated as discrete optimization. By showing several key properties of these two subproblems, we propose low-complexity algorithms to solve the subproblems optimally. We demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed algorithms over some simple heuristics via simulations in terms of the total data throughput in wireleslly powered IoT networks.					wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; Li, June/JEF-1173-2023; zhong, shan/HZJ-4647-2023														2327-4662					AUG	2018	5	4			SI		2781	2792		10.1109/JIOT.2018.2828851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2828851													WOS:000441428700050

The algorithm is general purpose and efficiently implementable on multiprocessor systems with associative memory. Details of its implementation on a 64-CPU parallel computer and results are presented for a hard problem arising in antibody-inventory optimization in vitro. Performance is discussed along with scope vis-a-vis other general purpose efficient algorithms for discrete SPPs. Scope and Purpose: Many real world optimization problems require solutions of large scale discrete programming problems with random or uncertain coefficients and inputs. Computational difficulties arise owing to the involvement of multiple summations of large number of nonlinear mathematical terms which may not satisfy any common regularity condition within the range of summations. Parallel and associative memory based algorithms are currently in demand for solving such problems. A general purpose computing network design is presented here which contributes in the above direction. Parallel implementation and results are illustrated on a real-world problem of cost (energy) minimization.																			0898-1221					MAR	1997	33	5					111	123		10.1016/S0898-1221(97)00024-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0898-1221(97)00024-2													WOS:A1997WT19300011

When designing a time-variant matrix inversion algorithm, it is highly demanded to suppress noises without violating the performance of real-time computation. However, most existing algorithms only consider a nominal system in the absence of noises, and may suffer from a great computational error when noises are taken into account. Some other algorithms assume that denoising has been conducted before computation, which may consume extra time and may not be suitable in practice. By considering the above situation, in this paper, an enhanced discrete-time Zhang neural network (EDTZNN) model is proposed, analyzed and investigated for time-variant matrix inversion. For comparison, an original discrete-time Zhang neural network (ODTZNN) model is presented. Note that the EDTZNN model is superior to ODTZNN model in suppressing various kinds of bias noises. Moreover, theoretical analyses show the convergence of the proposed EDTZNN model in the presence of various kinds of bias noises. In addition, numerical experiments including an application to robot motion planning are provided to substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed EDTZNN model for time-variant matrix inversion.

Specifically, the data missing happens randomly from the sensor to the controller and the controller to the actuator. A sequence of independent variables obeying the Bernoulli random binary distribution is introduced to account for the measurement missing.

Here, attention is focused on obtaining the sufficient conditions to guarantee the closed-loop system to be stochastically stable as well as the prescribed H performance.

Converting distribution networks designed for intermittent supply to continuous supply can further complicate this issue. Transitioning intermittent systems to continuous water supply, especially when the water utility is not able to ensure adherence of the fundamental assumptions, require not only good hydraulic engineering solutions but also sound engineering management solutions. The transition time can be very high ranging anywhere from several months to few years. This presentation will discuss the differences between traditional continuous water supply systems, intermittent water supply systems and future continuous water supply systems transitioned from intermittent water systems, and describes the necessary hydraulic engineering solutions as well as the engineering management solutions. The hydraulic engineering solutions include design of network elements based on both demand driven and pressure dependent flow models. Engineering management solutions include pressure and flow control solutions, air management solutions, and the feedback control loop for effective transitioning from intermittent water supply to continuous water supply.																					978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							267	277																WOS:000404788200020
J	Lyu, QY; Guo, M; Pei, Z				Lyu, Qiongshuai; Guo, Min; Pei, Zhao			DeGAN: Mixed noise removal via generative adversarial networks	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												Restoration of images corrupted by mixed noise (e.g., additive white Gaussian noise and impulse noise) is very difficult due to the complexity of the mixed noise distribution. Various mixed noise removal models involve the preprocessing based on outlier detection. However, the performance of these models largely depends on the accuracy of pixel location detection of outliers, and artifacts and missing image details are prone to occur when the mixture noise is strong. In this paper, a new denoising model based on generative adversarial network (DeGAN) is proposed to remove mixed noise in images. The proposed model combines generator, discriminator, and feature extractor networks. Through the mutual game between the generator and discriminator networks combined with additional training from the feature extractor network, the generator network implements a direct mapping from the noisy image domain to the noise-free image domain. In addition, we design a new joint loss function to incorporate information from image features and human visual perception into the mixed noise elimination task, which further improves the image quality and the visual effect. Abundant experiments show that the performance of our model is better than the state-of-the-art mixed noise removal methods in three different types of mixed noise scenarios, and the joint loss function does improve the denoising performance.

J	Hai, Q; Liu, ST				Hai, Quan; Liu, Shutang			Exponential synchronization of two different discrete-time chaotic neural networks with time delays and stochastic missing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS												In this paper, the exponential synchronization problem of two different discrete-time chaotic neural networks with time delays and stochastic disturbances is investigated. In addition, the unreliable communication links are taken into account between the master system and its slave system, which are modelled as stochastic data dropouts satisfying Bernoulli distributions. By utilizing the Lyapunov functional approach and the stochastic analysis theory, a sufficient condition for the error dynamic system to be mean-square exponentially stable is first obtained. Then based on such sufficient condition, a reliable controller is designed to guarantee that two different discrete-time delayed neural networks with stochastic disturbances are exponentially synchronized in the mean square. The parameters of a desired state feedback controller can be achieved by solving in terms of linear matrix inequality. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed synchronization approaches.					zhao, wenqing/KEZ-9488-2024														0020-7160	1029-0265				JUN 3	2022	99	6					1159	1177		10.1080/00207160.2021.1955106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207160.2021.1955106		JUL 2021											WOS:000678915200001

While the majority of currently existing CGG devices are based on complete mixing of chemical species, Our design harnesses partial diffusive mixing in multi-stream laminar flow, and hence, features simple network structures and enhanced device reliability. An iterative Simulation approach that incorporates our previous system-level models of CGG networks is developed to locate best-matched combinations of geometrical and operating parameters (e.g.. inlet flow rates and inlet sample concentrations) for the device design. Microfluidic CGG chips are fabricated and experimentally characterized using optimal layout and operating conditions selected by the design process. The experimental results not only serve as a benchmark for model verification but also establish the feasibility of concentration gradient generation based on partial mixing for a variety of microfluidic applications.

Deception attacks, in particular, are taken into account in the filter when the attacker attempts to modify the broadcast signal in communication networks by inserting some misleading information data into the assessment output. The Bernoulli distribution is satisfied by two sets of introduced stochastic variables. It shows the likelihood that the broadcaster's data transmissions will be the focus of deception attacks and sensor saturation. The Lyapunov functional technique is established, and criteria are derived to ensure that the system is meansquare stable. Furthermore, explicit expression of the filter gains is obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Lastly, two simulation examples including a synthetic genetic regulatory network are provided to further demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the suggested theoretical results.

Engineers have conventionally applied Taguchi methods to optimize parameter design. However, Taguchi methods can only obtain the optimal solution among the specified control factor levels. They cannot identify the real optimum when the parameter values are continuous. This study proposes a hybrid procedure combining neural networks and scatter search to optimize the continuous parameter design problem. First, neural networks are used to simulate the relationship between the control factor values and corresponding responses. Second, scatter search is employed to obtain the optimal parameter settings. The desirability function is utilized to transform the multiple responses into a single response. A case with dynamic characteristics is carried out in blood glucose strip manufacturing in Taiwan to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed procedure.

The network measurements are transmitted from two groups of sensors to a remote state estimator via two independent communication channels of limited bandwidths, and two SCPs are utilized to orchestrate the transmission orders of sensor nodes with aim to avoid data collisions. The estimation error dynamics is modeled by a Markovian switching system with two switching signals. By constructing a transmission-orderdependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and utilizing an up-to-date discrete Wirtinger-based inequality together with the reciprocally convex approach, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the stochastic finite-time boundedness for the estimation error dynamics with a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. The parameters of the state estimator are designed by solving a convex optimization problem which minimizes the disturbance attenuation level subject to several inequality constraints. The repressilator model is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the design procedure of the proposed state estimator.

J	Keskin, ME				Keskin, Muhammed Emre			Lifetime maximization of wireless sensor networks with sink costs	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES												Balanced distribution of the energy load of the sensors is important for the elongation of wireless sensor network (WSN) lifetimes. There are four main WSN design issues affecting the energy distribution among the sensors: sensor locations, sensor activity schedules, mobile sink routes, and data flow routes. Many studies try to make energy usage more efficient through optimal determination of these design issues. However, only very few studies handle these four design issues in a combined manner. Additionally, the cost of the sinks is neglected in all studies. In this study, a mixed integer linear program is first proposed, in which the cost of the sinks is taken into consideration in terms of lifetime hours and the four design issues are integrated. Next, a heuristic solution procedure for the solution of large network instances is offered and the efficiency of the heuristic is proven by comparing its performance with that of commercial solvers in extensive numerical instances.																			1300-0632	1303-6203					2017	25	6					4602	4614		10.3906/elk-1702-107	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/elk-1702-107													WOS:000416947200013

Due to the high cost and prolonged time required for upgrading infrastructure, it is expected that AVs will be introduced gradually into the existing transport network of human-driven vehicles (HVs) either jointly or separately in a special area or zone within that network. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework for modelling and deployment of multi-lane AV zone in a mixed-user traffic network that takes into account the different route choice decisions of HVs and AVs. The model is used to study two different designs for a multi-lane AV zone, where in Design 1, both lanes are dedicated for AVs inside the AV zone; while in Design 2, one lane is dedicated for AVs, and another lane is for the HV traffic. We then derive an equivalent convex formulation and develop a novel solution method for this complex problem, as well as evaluate and compare the performance of the designs in a realistic large-scale transportation network. Numerical results show that the deployment of a multi-lane AV zone improves network performance in terms of the total system travel time (TSTT). The proposed framework can be used to assist transportation planners and decision-makers to successfully deploy AVs seamlessly with mixed traffic.

The finite energy constraint limits the synchronization of sensors at every sampling instant which introduces sampling jitters. In this letter, we model sampling jitters using fractional delay transfer functions. The WSN is modeled using a hybrid multirate filter bank where the objective is to design discrete-time, causal and stable synthesis filters to minimize the effect of sampling jitters.

Different from the existing literature, we focus on the linear networked systems with external disturbances and both sensor- controller channel and controller-actuator channel are studied. First, we present a discrete-time modeling framework that leads to a stochastic closed-loop system with randomly varying parameters. To facilitate the analysis and H-infinity control of resulting discrete-time stochastic closed-loop system, an equivalent yet analyzable stochastic augmented model is further constructed by matrix exponential computation. Based on this model, a stability condition is derived in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) with the aid of a reduced-order confluent Vandermonde matrix, Kronecker product operation, and law of total expectation. Specifically, the dimension of the LMI obtained in this article does not increase as the upper bound of consecutive packet dropouts does, which is also different from the existing literature. Subsequently, a desired H-infinity controller is obtained such that the original discrete-time stochastic closed-loop system is exponentially mean-square stable with a prescribed H-infinity performance. Finally, a numerical example and a direct current motor system are exploited to substantiate the effectiveness and practicability of the designed strategy.

Lesion segmentation can remove unnecessary background areas and help doctors diagnose the condition. However, the infected areas showed differences at different stages, and the border between the infected areas and the surrounding tissue was blurred. To solve this problem, a novel COVID-19 lung infection segmentation network (Mix-Net) is designed for the automatic identification of infected areas from chest CT slices. Specifically, first, the local and global features of the infected areas are extracted and interacted with using the mixing block. Then, the features extracted from multiple layers of the encoder are fused and connected to the decoder. Experiments show that Mix-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and achieves good segmentation results.

Furthermore, microstrip crossover is used to avoid the use of multilayer PCB design, resulting in the elegant transfer of intersecting RF signals. The simulation and measurement results show acceptable mixed-mode results, confirming that the common-mode suppression is achieved.

Effects of residential greenness on attention in a longitudinal study at 8 and 11-13 years	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In an urbanizing world, with 55% of the population living in cities, it is essential to design friendly and healthy ones. An emerging body of evidence has associated greenspace exposure with improved cognitive development, including attentional function; however, the longitudinal studies looking at the association with attentional function are still scarce. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the association of the exposure to greenspace and attention in school children. This study was based on 751 participants at 8 years and 598 at 11-13 years of two sub-cohorts of the INMA cohort study in Gipuzkoa and Asturias, Spain. Greenspace exposure at home was characterized using four indicators: (i) average of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and (ii) Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) in buffers of 100 m, 300 m, and 500 m around the residential address, (ii) availability of a green space within 300 m from the residential address, and (iv) residential distance to green spaces. Participants' attention was characterized twice at ages of 8 and 11 years, using the computerized Attentional Network Test (ANT). General linear models were used for the cross-sectional analyses and linear mixed effects model for the longitudinal analyses. Our cross-sectional analyses showed a statistical significant protective association between average NDVI at 300 m and inattentiveness (-7.20, CI 95%: 13.74;-0.67). In our longitudinal analyses, although we generally observed beneficial associations between greenspace exposure and attention, none attained statistical significance.

J	Lee, J; Hube, S; Elgeti, S				Lee, Jaewook; Hube, Sebastian; Elgeti, Stefanie			Neural networks vs. splines: advances in numerical extruder design	ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS												In this paper, we present a novel approach to geometry parameterization that we apply to the design of mixing elements for single-screw extruders. The approach uses neural networks of a specific architecture to automatically learn an appropriate parameterization. This stands in contrast to the so far common user-defined parameterizations. Geometry parameterization is crucial in enabling efficient shape optimization as it allows for optimizing complex shapes using only a few design variables. Recent approaches often utilize computer-aided design (CAD) data in conjunction with spline-based methods where the spline's control points serve as design variables. Consequently, these approaches rely on the design variables specified by the human designer. This approach results in a significant amount of manual tuning to define a suitable parameterization. In addition, despite this effort, many times the optimization space is often limited to shapes in close proximity to the initial shape. In particular, topological changes are usually not feasible. In this work, we propose a method that circumvents this dilemma by providing low-dimensional, yet flexible shape parametrization using a neural network, which is independent of any computational mesh or analysis methods. Using the neural network for the geometry parameterization extends state-of-the-art methods in that the resulting design space is not restricted to user-prescribed modifications of certain basis shapes. Instead, within the same optimization space, we can interpolate between and explore seemingly unrelated designs. To show the performance of this new approach, we integrate the developed shape parameterization into our numerical design framework for dynamic mixing elements in plastics' extrusion. Finally, we challenge the novel method in a competitive setting against current free-form deformation-based approaches and demonstrate the method's performance even at this early stage.

However, large feature sizes in PE limit the complexity of a machine learning classifier (e.g., a neural network (NN)) in PE. Stochastic computing Neural Networks (SC-NNs) can reduce area in silicon technologies, but still require complex designs due to unique implementation tradeoffs in PE. In this paper, we propose a printed mixed-signal system, which substitutes complex and power-hungry conventional stochastic computing (SC) components by printed analog designs. The printed mixed-signal SC consumes only 35% of power consumption and requires only 25% of area compared to a conventional 4-bit NN implementation. We also show that the proposed mixed-signal SC-NN provides good accuracy for popular neural network classification problems. We consider this work as an important step towards the realization of printed SC-NN hardware for near-sensor-processing.

In this article, a new kind of fast distributed discrete-time algorithms is developed for solving convex optimization problems with closed convex set constraints over directed interaction networks. Under the gradient tracking framework, two distributed algorithms are, respectively, designed over balanced and unbalanced graphs, where momentum terms and two time-scales are involved. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the designed distributed algorithms attain linear speedup convergence rates provided that the momentum coefficients and the step size are appropriately selected. Finally, numerical simulations verify the effectiveness and the global accelerated effect of the designed algorithms.

J	Wakui, T; Hashiguchi, M; Sawada, K; Yokoyama, R				Wakui, Tetsuya; Hashiguchi, Moe; Sawada, Kento; Yokoyama, Ryohei			Two-stage design optimization based on artificial immune system and mixed-integer linear programming for energy supply networks	ENERGY												A two-stage optimization approach based on an artificial immune system (AIS) and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) was developed to efficiently solve large-scale structural design problems of energy supply networks and obtain multiple and diverse design candidates. By focusing on a hierarchical relationship between design and operation variables, a structural design problem, formulated using MILP, is decomposed into an upper-level design problem and a lower-level operation problem. The upper-level design problem is solved using an AIS, in which multiple and diverse sets of suboptimal solutions are searched in a short computation time. In the lower-level optimization, design variables are fixed at the values searched in the upper-level optimization and operation variables are optimized using MILP. Moreover, the lower-level optimization for multiple sets of design variables is separately conducted using parallel computing. The developed approach was applied to the structural design of an energy supply network, consisting of candidates of cogeneration units and heat pump water heating units under power and heat interchange, for a housing complex with four dwellings. The diversity and energy-saving performance of multiple design candidates were analyzed. The computational efficiency was also demonstrated in comparison to the results obtained using only a commercial MILP solver. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their deployments not only span a wide range of networking and communications environment, but also range from small sized networks (e.g., special operations networks) to large scale networks (e.g., sensor networks, military networks). While the design and analysis for small sized networks is well underway, the counterpart for large sized networks (i.e., networks with 1000's of nodes, which we also refer to as 0(1000) node networks) is far from having been understood. It is not only important that this gap in the understanding of scalability performance is filled, but it is also extremely critical given the fact that the large scale networks that are being deployed (e.g., sensory networks, military networks) need to carry mission critical data. However the challenges in analyzing large scale MANETs (i.e., 0(1000) node networks) are daunting. In this work, we focus on this scalability analysis problem and propose techniques to render such an analysis feasible. More specifically, we combine the power of discrete event simulations (DES), novel memory management (state-of-the-art computing hardware) and analytic modeling in a judicious manner in order to provide a methodology for scalability analysis. We also propose an adaptive algorithm (via analytic modeling), which when combined with DES techniques enhances scalability performance and analysis of MANET routing protocols, significantly.

A DTDO is first constructed to estimate the unknown bounded disturbance. On the basis of the output of the DTDO and the discrete-time fractional-order theories, a robust discrete-time fractional-order control scheme is then designed by using the backstepping control technique for a discrete-time UAV system with disturbances. The proposed control scheme is expected to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system with all system signals bounded. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.					chen, mou/KOC-4929-2024	Shao, Shuyi/0000-0001-9458-661X													1049-8923	1099-1239				MAY 25	2022	32	8					4665	4682		10.1002/rnc.6046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rnc.6046		FEB 2022											WOS:000750904700001

Design Rules for Binary Bisamide Gelators: toward Gels with Tailor-Made Structures and Properties	LANGMUIR												This study intends to develop design rules for binarymixture ofgelators that govern their assembly behavior and subsequently explorethe impact of their supramolecular assembly patterns on the gels'rheological properties. To achieve these goals, nBA gelators with odd and even parities [n-methylenespacers between the amide groups (n = 5-10)and 17 carbons at each end] were blended at different ratios. Suchbisamides with simple structures were selected to study because theirdifferent spacer lengths offer the possibility to have matching ornon-matching hydrogen bonds. The results show that the assembly behaviorof binary mixtures of bisamide gelators is the same in the solid andgel states. Binary mixtures of gelators, which only differ two methylenemoieties in the spacer length, form compounds and co-assemble intofibers and sheets observed for (5BA)(1)(7BA)(1) and(6BA)(1)(8BA)(1) mixtures, respectively. Binarygelator mixtures of the same parity and a larger spacer length differencestill lead to mixing for the odd parity couple (5BA)(1)(9BA)(1)), but to partial phase separation for the even parity mixture(6BA)(1)(10BA)(1). Binary mixtures of gelators ofdifferent parities gave complete phase separation in the solid state,and self-sorted gels consisting of discrete fibers and sheets in thegels of (5BA)(3)(6BA)(1) and (5BA)(3)(10BA)(1). The even-even binary gels (20 wt %) consisting ofco-assembled sheets show higher G & PRIME; than odd-oddbinary gels (20 wt %) consisting of co-assembled fibers. In general,the self-sorting of odd and even molecules into the separate primarystructures results in a dramatic decrease of G & PRIME;compared to the co-assembled gels (20 wt %), except for (5BA)(1)(9BA)(1) gel (20 wt %). It might be due to largerwoven spheres in (5BA)(1)(9BA)(1) gel (20 wt %),which probably have a less entangled gel network.					; van Esch, Jan/E-5543-2011	Picken, Stephen/0000-0002-6003-518X; van Esch, Jan/0000-0001-6116-4808													0743-7463	1520-5827				2023 AUG 14	2023										10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c01487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c01487		AUG 2023						37578393					WOS:001048192100001

This problem consists of designing a collection network for a wind farm, assuming that the locations of the turbines and the potential cables are known, several cable types are available, and the cost of the energy that dissipates through the cables is known. We propose a mixed integer quadratic programme to model the network design problem and then linearize the quadratic programme because the latter is too difficult to solve using a standard mathematical programming software. We describe several classes of inequalities that strengthen the resulting mixed integer linear programme.

The graph properties complicate the design of synchronization controllers due to the interplay between the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix and the required stabilizing gains. Two methods are given herein that decouple the design of the synchronizing gains from the detailed graph properties. Both are based on computation of the local control gains using Riccati design; the first is based on an H-infinity type Riccati inequality and the second on an H-2 type Riccati equation. Conditions are given for synchronization based on the relation of the graph eigenvalues to a bounded circular region in the complex plane that depends on the agent dynamics and the Riccati solution. The notion of 'synchronizing region' is used. An example shows the effectiveness of these design methods for guaranteeing synchronization in cooperative discrete-time systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Ferrocene, exhibiting redox activity and facile chemical modification, is a versatile metalloligand component. However, most metal complexes with ferrocene-containing ligands form discrete low-dimensional chelate complexes or coordination polymers. Thus, we designed and synthesized ferrocene-based multidentate ligands, 1,2-di(4-pyridylthio)ferrocene (L1) and 1,2-di(2-pyridylthio)ferrocene (L2). Here we report the synthesis and structures of molecular square complexes and coordination polymers containing L1, which reacted with M(hfac)(2) (hfac = 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoroacetylacetonate) and AgCF3SO3 to yield molecular square complexes [M(hfac)(2)(L1)](2)center dot 2C(6)H(5)CH(3)[M = Ni (1) and Co (2)] and [Ag(CF3SO3)(L1)(H2O)(0.5)](2)center dot 2CH(2)Cl(2)center dot H2O (3). The molecular square units comprise two metal ions bridged by two ligands. Isomorphic complexes 1 and 2 accommodate two toluene molecules above and below the molecular square. Ll reacted with Cu(hfac)(2) and CuI to yield zigzag, {[Cu(hfac)(2) (LI)]}(n)center dot 0.25n(CH2Cl2) (4), and ribbon-shaped, {[Cu4I4(L1)(2)]}(n) (5), coordination polymers. In 4, L1 behaves as a bidentate N,N-ligand bridging the Cu-II ions, while in 5 it acts as a tridentate S,N,N-ligand linking the stepped-cubane Cu4I4 units. L1 reacted with AgX to form two-dimensional coordination polymers {[Ag(ClO4)(L1)]}(n) (6) and {[Ag(L1)]PF6}(n) (7), in which it acted as a tetradentate S,S,N,N-ligand.

First, a switched time delay system model in discrete domain is established to describe the dynamic of discrete triggering control system subjected to DoS attacks. To analyze the H-infinity performance of the switched delay system, we combine discrete piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method and average dwell time (ADT) based switch system method. Then, the weighted H-infinity performance would be preserved if the derived sufficient conditions were satisfied. The main conclusion is a criterion that the allowable margin of the duration and frequency of DoS attacks can be estimated explicitly. Under the criterion, the static output feedback control law can be solved by using LMIs techniques. Finally, we apply our method to design the resilient load frequency control (LFC) scheme of a three-area power system.

Specifically, an ANN is successfully applied to problems that are difficult to solve or do not have any information on their operating techniques. In this article, an ANN was applied to predict the concrete mix composition for steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC). Thus, an ANN model was developed and trained with data collected from literature. These data have SFRC mix compositions, workability measurements of fresh SFRC, compressive strength of SFRCs, and additional information that affects concrete quality. Additionally, the ANN included steel fiber volume fraction in the SFRC and steel fiber properties. With the goal of determining the concrete mix composition, which is cement dosage, amount of water, coarse aggregate content, fine aggregate content, and chemical admixture, an ANN model was developed. The inputs for the ANN were consistency class of SFRC, compressive strength of SFRC, maximum size of aggregate, steel fiber volume fraction, steel fiber length, and diameter. At the end of the study, a feed forward ANN model with six inputs and five outputs was successfully trained and used to produce the correct responses to testing data. Designing SFRC requires more trial mixtures to obtain the desired quality than does conventional concrete. In conclusion, artificial neural networks have a strong potential for predicting concrete mix composition for SFRC such that without trial mixes and loss of time, an SFRC design is possible with the desired workability and mechanical properties.

How to identify the connections from these fundamental properties to the network topology and weights is of great interest. It is, however, very challenging to do that because the Gramian is an extremely complicated function of the network topology and weights. In this paper, we consider the simplest case where the Gramian is diagonal. One of the main contributions of this paper is to prove the necessary and sufficient graphical conditions for a discrete-time dynamical network to feature a diagonal Gramian. The explicit relations between the values of the diagonal entries of the Gramian and the network weights are also established. The proposed results may be used to design networks with desired control energy and robustness performance. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a mixed formation control design based on edge and bearing measurements is proposed for networked multi-vehicle systems. Although conventional edge-based controllers have been widely used in many formation tasks, the tracking accuracy may not be guaranteed in some extreme environments as it depends on the quality of the sensors and requires the exact position data of each vehicle. To overcome this limitation, we combine the edge-based controller with a bearing-based method where only relative bearings among the vehicles are required. Depending on the sensingability of the robotic platform, this mixed control method can provide an efficient solution to maximise the tracking performance. Both leaderless and leader-follower cases are considered in the protocol design. The stability of the networked multi-vehicle systems under the proposed mixed formation approach is ensured by Lyapunov theory. Finally, we present simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

This paper presents a new design procedure for synthesizing associative memories based on continuous-time cellular neural networks with time delays characterized by input and Output matrices obtained using two-dimensional space-invariant cloning templates. The design procedure enables hetero-associative or auto-associative memories to be synthesized by solving a set of linear inequalities with few design parameters and retrieval probes feeding from external inputs instead of initial states. The designed associative memories are robust in terms of design parameter selection, In addition, the hosting cellular neural networks are guaranteed to be globally exponentially stable. Simulation and experimental results of illustrative examples and Monte Carlo tests demonstrate the applicability and superiority of the methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design optimization techniques that account for process variation while presenting an accurate and fast design flow which can perform design optimization in reasonable time are still lacking. As a trade-off of the accuracy and speed, this paper presents a process-variation aware design flow for ultra-fast variability-aware optimization of nano-CMOS based physical design of analog circuits. It combines Kriging bootstrapped Neural Network (KBNN) metamodels with a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in the design optimization flow. The KBNN provides a trade-off between analog-quality accuracy and scalability and can be effectively used for large and complex AMS circuits while capturing correlations in process variations. The effectiveness of the design flow is demonstrated using a 180nm CMOS based PLL as a case study with 21 design parameters. The KBNN metamodel is 24x faster than NN metamodeling.

Efficient implementation of the recovery and recycling policy requires appropriate logistics structures to be designed for the flow of recyclable products from source to manufacturer. The present study develops a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for optimal design of recycled paper distribution network. The model helps in determining the optimal location of facilities and product flow for paper recycling network in a multi-item, multi-echelon, multi-facility environment. The expansion and contraction of requirements of the facility capacities was analyzed by conducting sensitivity analysis. The significance of segregation of relevant wastepaper at the source compared to intermediate stages could also be established. The over-estimation and under-estimation of unit cost parameters of recycling network led to only marginal deviation in the system cost. The utility of the proposed model is illustrated through a case study on an Indian recycled paper network.

Vertical gap (clearance) between two consecutive trays is optimized for selected latitudes of 30 degrees, 35 degrees, 40 degrees, 45 degrees and 50 degrees N. Global solar radiation and thermal models are developed to predict the solar radiation availability and HGCD chamber air temperature (T-hgcd). Forced draft paddy straw bale combustor (FDPSBC) is used to generate flue gas above 500 degrees C temperature as supplemental heat source and coupled with flue gas heat transfer pipe network (FGHTPN) laid inside the HGCD to maintain T-hgcd at constant temperature. Biomass heating load requirements (forced convection and radiation heats) were predicted through developed heat transfer model. The developed thermal model predicted the Thgcd of 26 degrees C to 38 degrees C equivalent to heating load of 4-6.5 kW when ambient air temperature remained between 10 degrees C and 18 degrees C at Ludhiana climate (30 degrees N) India. Heat transfer model predicted about 26.2 kW and 13.4 kW of supplemental heat during severe and moderate night temperatures of -5 degrees C and 10 degrees C which can be met through complete combustion of 80 kg and 40 kg of paddy straw biomass per hour respectively to maintain Thgcd between 60 and 62 degrees C. Logarithmic drying model is the best fitting drying model for fenugreek drying. Economic analysis shows that the proposed technology can recover its cost within five years and has great adaptability potential in terms of paddy straw management in India.						sethi, veerparkash/0000-0003-1663-5580													0038-092X					AUG	2020	206						120	135		10.1016/j.solener.2020.06.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2020.06.006													WOS:000566925200001

The DCFB was comprised of a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) at reducing temperature for the release of fuel-N and a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) for combustion of the residue char. A dense discrete phase model coupled with kinetic theory of granular flow (DDPM-KTGF) model was used to determine the gas-solid flow characteristics of the DCFB, and a one-dimensional chemical reaction network (1D-CRN) with detailed chemical reaction mechanisms was used for understanding its NO(x)formation mechanisms. Results showed that bed particles in the CFB dense phase of DCFB were well-mixed and showed a typical "ring-core" structure in the dilute phase, proving good fluidization quality of bed materials. Meanwhile, circulation ash in BFB with sizes lager than 0.1 mm would pass through the designed overflow port, allowing mass flow from BFB to CFB. Investigation into NO(x)formation revealed that reactions such as R398, R1-N-1, R569, and R17 associating with O/O(2)and volatile N would promote NO(x)formation in DCFB, whereas reactions mainly R411, R570, R571, R5, and R6 associating with NH2, soot, and char inhibited NO(x)formation. The overall NO(x)emission at the furnace outlet of DCFB was calculated to be 97.29 mg/Nm(3), which was 56.66% lower than that in traditional CFB with the same configuration. Consequently, the novel DCFB design that separating fuel-N release and char combustion provides an alternative means for manipulating NO(x)emission during CFB combustion.

Due to the eco-friendly nature of sustainable bioenergy, we investigated an integrated bioenergy supply chain network design. In the proposed network, different energy crops, Azadirachta indica and Eruca sativa are taken into account, which leads to different sources for bioenergy production. Furthermore, to prevent further environmental pollution, the wastewater produced at biorefinery is used to generate bioelectricity. This paper addresses a sustainable-efficient bioenergy supply chain network design under uncertainty. A multi-period, multi-product mathematical model is proposed to minimize inefficiency, environmental impacts, and supply chain costs. Furthermore, to cope with uncertainty, a mixed robust-possibilistic programming approach is applied to the model. Finally, computational results based on Iran's real-world case demonstrate the improved performance of the designed bioenergy network by considering three measures of cost, efficiency, and environmental impacts.

In response, researchers are increasingly focusing on cryptographic solutions to ensure the reliability of confidential information. Recognizing the superiority of chaotic systems preference as entropy source of cryptographic systems, this paper proposes a novel true random number generator (TRNG) design by combining four different chaotic systems outputs, tailored for real-time video encryption application. These chaotic systems are continuous-time Lorenz and fractional-order Chen-Lee systems, as well as discrete-time Logistic and Tent maps. This study generates true random bit (TRB) sequences at a high bit rate (25 Mbps) through the hardware implementations of four distinct chaotic systems to have the best statistical randomness in the resulting output. Then, the cryptographic true random key bits (8-bit at 25 MHz frequency) are employed in the post-processing with real-time video data by using the XOR operation, a fundamental post-processing algorithm. The real-time video encryption application is executed on an experimental assembly, composed of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) development kit, an OV7670 camera module, a VGA monitor, and prototype circuit boards for the chaotic systems. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encryption system, several security assessments are conducted. These include NIST SP 800 - 22 statistical tests, FIPS 140-1 standards, chi-square tests, histogram and correlation analysis, and NPCR and UACI differential attack resilience tests. Consequently, the findings suggest that the presented real-time embedded cryptosystem is robust and suitable for secure communications, particularly in the realm of video transmission.																			1380-7501	1573-7721				2024 JAN 16	2024										10.1007/s11042-023-17972-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-023-17972-5		JAN 2024											WOS:001156040200004

J	Wang, G				Wang, Gang			Designing a stochastic supply chain network: An error-bound-based heuristic	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING												Designing a stochastic supply chain is challenging because demand is often partially observable or unknown in advance. This paper presents an alternative approach to address a three-echelon stochastic supply chain network design with insufficient demand information. We formulate a stochastic mixed-integer program with chance constraints. We identify a lower and upper bound on the value at risk to deal with chance constraints, thus inducing two mixed-integer linear approximations to the stochastic program. We develop a branch-and-price scheme to solve the approximations and a primal heuristic algorithm for initial columns. We then create a heuristic algorithm for solving the original problem by implementing sensitivity analysis and error bound on the approximations. Besides network size, computational experiments find that network design performance depends on aggregate service levels and maximum demand variations. The aggregate behavior of service levels has an inverse impact on the network design performance, while maximum coefficients of demand variations present a positive effect. Computational results reveal that our proposed algorithms perform well compared to normal distributions and a robust optimization formulation. Our models and algorithms suggest a feasible network design tool for handling uncertainties in supply chains.																			0360-8352	1879-0550				OCT	2023	184								109570	10.1016/j.cie.2023.109570	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109570		SEP 2023											WOS:001076360500001

Since that the controller is connected with the plant via a communication channel, it can only access the sampled information of the switching signal and system state, where there may exist the time varying transmission delay from the sensor to the controller. The original switching signal are merged with its sampled measurements to formulate a new switching signal, therefore, a switched system with state delay is obtained for the resulted closed-loop system when input delay approach is applied. A new sufficient condition for the exponential stability of the closed-loop system is obtained by discrete time multiple Lyapunov functional method. Then, a particular quadratic Lyapunov function is constructed in order to design the state feedback controllers.

J	Yang, QM; Jagannathan, S				Yang, Qinmin; Jagannathan, Sarangapani			Reinforcement Learning Controller Design for Affine Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems using Online Approximators	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS												In this paper, reinforcement learning state- and output-feedback-based adaptive critic controller designs are proposed by using the online approximators (OLAs) for a general multi-input and multioutput affine unknown nonlinear discrete-time systems in the presence of bounded disturbances. The proposed controller design has two entities, an action network that is designed to produce optimal signal and a critic network that evaluates the performance of the action network. The critic estimates the cost-to-go function which is tuned online using recursive equations derived from heuristic dynamic programming. Here, neural networks (NNs) are used both for the action and critic whereas any OLAs, such as radial basis functions, splines, fuzzy logic, etc., can be utilized. For the output-feedback counterpart, an additional NN is designated as the observer to estimate the unavailable system states, and thus, separation principle is not required. The NN weight tuning laws for the controller schemes are also derived while ensuring uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system using Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the two controllers is tested in simulation on a pendulum balancing system and a two-link robotic arm system.																			1083-4419	1941-0492				APR	2012	42	2			SI		377	390		10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2166384	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2166384								21947529					WOS:000302097000008

The purpose is to compute a topology that provides low response delays for network users at a minimal cost of bridge installations. We formulate this network design problem as a mixed binary integer linear program. We develop effective heuristic algorithms. The algorithms exploit the topology and routing solutions of the linear programming relaxation in a sophisticated manner which we believe is new in the literature. The model incorporates performance issues, such as network stability, bridge overflow, back pressure effect and broadcast storm, that are specific to the underlying communication technology. By formally incorporating these performance issues, we tighten the model formulation and improve the quality of the LP bound considerably. Computational results are reported for problems with up to 20 token rings and 190 potential bridge locations.

The NRCP system consists of a PC controller equipped with MATLAB/Simulink software and an embedded target designed with open-source hardware, e.g., Raspberry Pi and STM32. Therefore, it benefits from the following advantages, such as simple structure, low cost, convenient deployment, and robust scalability. In order to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NRCP, a networked magnetic levitation control system (NMLCS) is developed on the basis of this NRCP system. Furthermore, a discrete-time equivalent-input-disturbance (DEID)-based model predictive control approach is proposed for NMLCS to deal with the common practical issues in NCSs, such as time delay and disturbance. Specifically, the time delay is modeled as delay-induced disturbance (DID), whose influence is effectively estimated and eliminated by the designed controller. Several experimental case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of the NRCP, the DEID-based control algorithm, and the analytical method of DID.

J	Pishvaee, MS; Rabbani, M				Pishvaee, Mir Saman; Rabbani, Masoud			A graph theoretic-based heuristic algorithm for responsive supply chain network design with direct and indirect shipment	ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE												The configuration of the supply chain network has a strong influence on the overall performance of the supply chain. A well designed supply chain network provides a proper platform for efficient and effective supply chain management. The supply chain network should be designed in the way that could meet the customer needs with an efficient cost. This paper studies the responsive, multi-stage supply chain network design (SCND) problem under two conditions: (1) when direct shipment is allowed and (2) when direct shipment is prohibited. First, two mixed integer programming models are proposed for multi-stage, responsive SCND problem under two abovementioned conditions. Then, to escape from the complexity of mixed integer mathematical programming models, graph theoretic approach is used to study the structure of the SCND problems and it is proven that both of SCND problems considered in this paper could be modeled by a bipartite graph. Finally, since such network design problems belong to the class of NP-hard problems, a novel heuristic solution method is developed based on a new solution representation method derived from graph theoretic view to the structure of the studied problem. To assess the performance of the proposed heuristic solution method, the associated results are compared to the exact solutions obtained by a commercial. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, SW; Yuan, CX; Zhang, CM				Wang, Suwei; Yuan, Chenxun; Zhang, Caiming			LPE-Unet: An Improved UNet Network Based on Perceptual Enhancement	ELECTRONICS												In Computed Tomography (CT) images of the coronary arteries, the segmentation of calcified plaques is extremely important for the examination, diagnosis, and treatment of coronary heart disease. However, one characteristic of the lesion is that it has a small size, which brings two difficulties. One is the class imbalance when computing loss function and the other is that small-scale targets are prone to losing details in the continuous downsampling process, and the blurred boundary makes the segmentation accuracy less satisfactory. Therefore, the segmentation of calcified plaques is a very challenging task. To address the above problems, in this paper, we design a framework named LPE-UNet, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure similar to UNet. The framework includes two powerful modules named the low-rank perception enhancement module and the noise filtering module. The low-rank perception enhancement module extracts multi-scale context features by increasing the receptive field size to aid target detection and then uses an attention mechanism to filter out redundant features. The noise filtering module suppresses noise interference in shallow features to high-level features in the process of multi-scale feature fusion. It computes a pixel-wise weight map of low-level features and filters out useless and harmful information. To alleviate the problem of class imbalance caused by small-sized lesions, we use a weighted cross-entropy loss function and Dice loss to perform mixed supervised training on the network. The proposed method was evaluated on the calcified plaque segmentation dataset, achieving a high F1 score of 0.941, IoU of 0.895, and Dice of 0.944. This result verifies the effectiveness and superiority of our approach for accurately segmenting calcified plaques. As there is currently no authoritative publicly available calcified plaque segmentation dataset, we have constructed a new dataset for coronary artery calcified plaque segmentation (Calcified Plaque Segmentation Dataset, CPS Dataset).

J	Hanitra, IN; Criscuolo, F; Carrara, S; De Micheli, G				Hanitra, Ivan Ny; Criscuolo, Francesca; Carrara, Sandro; De Micheli, Giovanni			Multi-Ion-Sensing Emulator and Multivariate Calibration Optimization by Machine Learning Models	IEEE ACCESS												One paramount challenge in multi-ion-sensing arises from ion interference that degrades the accuracy of sensor calibration. Machine learning models are here proposed to optimize such multivariate calibration. However, the acquisition of big experimental data is time and resource consuming in practice, necessitating new paradigms and efficient models for these data-limited frameworks. Therefore, a novel approach is presented in this work, where a multi-ion-sensing emulator is designed to explain the response of an ion-sensing array in a mixed-ion environment. A case study is performed emulating the concurrent monitoring of sodium, potassium, lithium, and lead ions, in a medium representative of sweat samples. These analytes are relevant examples of sweat ion-sensing applications for physiology, therapeutic drug monitoring, and heavy metal contamination. It is demonstrated that calibration datasets output by the emulator explain accurately the experimental response of polymeric solid-contact ion-selective electrodes, where root-meansquared error of 1.37, 1.44, 1.78, 2 my are obtained, respectively, for Na+, K+, Li+, Pb2+ sensor calibration in artificial sweat. Besides, synthetic datasets of custom size are generated to train, validate, and evaluate different types of multivariate regressors. A Multi-Output Support Vector Regressor (M-SVR) is proposed as a compact, accurate, robust, and efficient multivariate calibration model. It features 13.22% normalized root mean squares, and 20.29% mean root squares improvement compared to a simple linear regression model. It is an unbiased estimator for medium to large datasets, and its average generalization error is of 3.22%. Besides, M-SVR models have a lower computational complexity than single-output SVR or neural network models, making them a suitable solution for memory and energy-constrained edge devices used for continuous and real-time multi-ion monitoring.

J	Tanyimboh, TT				Tanyimboh, Tiku T.			Redundant binary codes in genetic algorithms: multi-objective design optimization of water distribution networks	WATER SUPPLY												Genetic algorithms have been shown to be highly effective for optimization problems in various disciplines, and binary coding is generally adopted as it is straightforward to implement and lends itself to problems with discrete-valued decision variables. However, a difficulty associated with binary coding is the existence of redundant codes that do not correspond to any element in the finite discrete set that the encoded parameter belongs to. A common technique used to address redundant binary codes is to discard the chromosomes in which they occur. Effective alternatives to the outright removal of redundant codes are lacking in the literature. This article presents illustrative examples based on the problem of optimizing the design of water distribution networks. Two benchmark networks in the literature and two different multi-objective design optimization models were considered. Different fixed mapping schemes gave significantly different solutions in the search space. The main inference from the results is that mapping schemes that improved diversity in the population of solutions achieved better results, which may pave the way for the development of practical and effective mapping schemes.																			1606-9749	1607-0798				FEB 1	2021	21	1					444	457		10.2166/ws.2020.329	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2020.329													WOS:000627146300033
J	Thomadsen, T; Stidsen, T				Thomadsen, Tommy; Stidsen, Thomas			The generalized fixed-charge network design problem	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												In this paper we present the generalized fixed-charge network design (GFCND) problem. The GFCND problem is an instance of the so-called generalized network design problems. In such problems, clusters instead of nodes have to be interconnected by a network. The network interconnecting the clusters is a fixed-charge network, and thus the GFCND problem generalizes the fixed-charge network design problem. The GFCND problem is related to the more general problem of designing hierarchical telecommunication networks. A mixed integer programming model is described and a branch-cut-and-price algorithm is implemented. Violated constraints and variables with negative reduced costs are found using enumeration. The algorithm is capable of obtaining optimal solutions for problems with up to 30 clusters and up to 300 nodes. This is possible, since the linear programming relaxation bound is very tight and there are few non-zero variables and few binding constraints. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the empirical results of a challenging model of 'Communities of Innovation' (CoI). MindSh@re is the so-called "meta-organization" that implements Finmeccanica's (the Italian ASD Company) technical knowledge network by utilizing all the available intellectual resources as a lever to promote "open innovation". MindSh@re is an extended organizational model aimed at adding value to the existing technological knowledge within the Finmeccanica Companies, the assessment of its knowledge resources and competencies, and at the sharing of best practices. It is designed with the goal of connecting people within a network and acting by multiplying the generation of new ideas, products, talent and is the engine for real value innovation through the "Technological Community", a flat organization which is aimed at providing focus and sharing research on those topics considered as leading industrial points of view. The resources involved in MindSh@re come mainly from the Engineering and Strategy Directions, with close ties to the Commercial, Marketing and Human Resources functions of the companies. This mix increases focus on targets, whilst at the same time, ensures innovative development and the growth of those resources committed to it. The present case study presents the model in the body of knowledge and depicts deeply its organization and philosophy. Three key elements are highlighted as being pillars of its success; people are at the core of this "engine", corporate management directly governs the project by assuring continuous alignment with business strategy and performance assessment, finally innovation emerges as a result of organizational knowledge.																					978-1-906638-30-6				2009							236	245																WOS:000281045000027

Most of the applications require a sufficiently long network operation, which makes the efficient management of the available energy resources an important issue. It is a known phenomenon that sensors communicating directly with a sink deplete their energy faster than others. Hence, some of the sinks are disconnected from the rest of the network even though most of the sensors are still functional. A possible remedy is to balance the relaying load of the sensors using mobile sinks and controlling their mobility. In this work, we consider three major design issues, i.e., coverage, locating mobile sinks, and routing sensor-to-sink data within a unified framework and develop mixed-integer linear programming formulations to maximise the network lifetime. We also numerically compare the new models and demonstrate the improvement obtained by controlling the sink mobility and integrating various design issues.					Altinel, I.

The primary advantage of this off-policy Q-learning method is that it can work for the linear discrete-time systems with inaccurate system model, unmeasurable system states and network-induced delays. To this end, an optimization problem for networked control systems composed of a plant, a state observer and a Smith predictor is formulated first. The Smith predictor is employed to not only compensate network-induced delays, but also make the separation principle hold, thus the observer and controller can be designed separately. Then, the off-policy Q-learning is implemented for learning the optimal observer gain and the optimal controller combined with the Smith predictor, such that a novel off-policy Q-learning algorithm is derived using only input, output and delayed estimated state of systems, not the inaccurate system matrices. The convergences of the iterative observer gain and the iterative controller gain are rigorously proven. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

An event-triggered piecewise continuous systems (PCS) based control for time-varying trajectory tracking is proposed. By designing the sensor system and controller system, the communication between them is reduced while still retaining a satisfactory closed-loop behavior of the whole system. The major idea behind a designed sensor system is the use of a Luenberger observer and planning of event-triggered mechanism (ETM). The main principle behind the designed controller system is the proposal of a new event-triggered PCS based controller. The development is motivated by consideration of variable network induced time delays. Tracking error is proved to be norm-bounded in both the original and developed case.

Moreover, it ensured convergence of the queue length to the desired consensus steady-state value with resulting network queue balancing.

We propose a two-step iterative algorithm to maximize the sum throughput of the users in a MIMO WPCN with discrete signal inputs. Firstly, the optimal solution of a convex power allocation problem can be found given a fixed time allocation; Secondly, a semi closed form solution for the optimal time allocation is obtained when fixing the power allocation matrix. By optimizing the power allocation and time allocation alternately, the two-step algorithm converges to a local optimal point. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional schemes, which consider only Gaussian inputs.

The method combines water-using processes with wastewater-treating operations into a single network based on source/sink representation. The model, which contains all the network configurations of source-sink matches including reuse, regeneration reuse and regeneration recycle, also considering multiple contaminants, is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) with topological constraints. The MILP model's global optimality is guaranteed if a solution exists. Finally, a case study involving water reuse/recycle is implemented to show the effectiveness of the model.

In a networked control system, the controller and plant are located away from each other and exchange data over a network, which causes network delays that may fluctuate randomly due to network routing. So, in this paper, we assume that the current network delay is not known but an estimated maximum value of fluctuating network delays is known beforehand. Moreover, we also assume that the sensor cannot observe all state variables of the plant. Under these assumption, we apply continuous deep Q-learning to the design of the networked controller. Then, we introduce an extended state consisting of a sequence of past control inputs and outputs as inputs to the deep neural network. By simulation, it is shown that, using the extended state, the controller can learn a control policy robust to the fluctuation of the network delays under the partial observation.																			0743-1546		978-1-7281-1398-2				2019							6793	6798																WOS:000560779006036

In particular, the event-driven types of discrete systems are actually important. There are many those types of systems, e.g., manufacturing systems, industry and welfare robots, computer networks, and so forth. However, the analysis and design of such discrete dynamic systems have not been established, because those systems have severe nonlinear characteristics and do not respond continuously in time. In this paper, the stability of discrete-event dynamic systems are examined using multiple metrics and simultaneous linear inequalities. Numerical examples are shown to clarify the stability and boundedness of periodic discrete-event systems.

T-S fuzzy model is employed to approximate the discrete networked control system with time-varying state delay and external disturbance. Stochastic system theory and Bernoulli probability distribution are employed to describe the time-varying communication delay and multipath packet dropouts. Delay-dependent T-S fuzzy dynamic output feedback controller is designed. The delay-dependent T-S fuzzy dynamic output feedback controller is employed to relax the design conditions and enhance the design flexibility.

To integrate both kinds of process units, a two-phase approach is proposed. First, all batch units are treated as operating in continuous mode, and the inter-plant water network is synthesized for minimum fresh water consumption. Policy of water storage for the batch units is then determined, on which they can behave as continuous units. The objective of the second phase is to minimize the capacity of storage tanks subject to the determined water flow rates. An example is solved to illustrate the proposed approach.

The considered randomly occurring delays include the multiple state delays and the infinite-distributed delay. Both of them are assumed to occur in random ways, which are governed by two independent stochastic variables satisfying the Bernoulli binary distribution. Network-induced delays are modeled as a discrete-time homogeneous Markov chain, and the transition probabilities of the Markov chain are partially known. A stochastic Lyapunov functional is constructed to design a full-order fault detection filter guaranteeing that the fault detection dynamics is stochastically admissible with a prescribed performance index. Hence, the fault detection filter design problem is converted into a convex optimization problem in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. If these linear matrix inequalities are feasible, the corresponding parameters of the designed fault detection filter are determined. Finally, a numerical example is addressed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.																			0142-3312	1477-0369				APR	2015	37	4					446	456		10.1177/0142331214541512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0142331214541512													WOS:000351052900002
J	Wang, M; Wang, ZD; Chen, Y; Sheng, WG				Wang, Min; Wang, Zidong; Chen, Yun; Sheng, Weiguo			Adaptive Neural Event-Triggered Control for Discrete-Time Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS												This paper proposes a novel event-triggered (ET) adaptive neural control scheme for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems in a strict-feedback form. In the proposed scheme, the ideal control input is derived in a recursive design process, which relies on system states only and is unrelated to virtual control laws. In this case, the high-order neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate the ideal control input (but not the virtual control laws), and then the corresponding adaptive neural controller is developed under the ET mechanism. A modified NN weight updating law, nonperiodically tuned at triggering instants, is designed to guarantee the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of NN weight estimates for all sampling times. In virtue of the bounded NN weight estimates and a dead-zone operator, the ET condition together with an adaptive ET threshold coefficient is constructed to guarantee the UUB of the closed-loop networked control system through the Lyapunov stability theory, thereby largely easing the network communication load. The proposed ET condition is easy to implement because of the avoidance of: 1) the use of the intermediate ET conditions in the backstepping procedure; 2) the computation of virtual control laws; and 3) the redundant triggering of events when the system states converge to a desired region. The validity of the presented scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.

Two modeling approaches are compared: A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model and a district heating network (DHN) simulation model. The MILP model was developed for the simultaneous design of the network layout, the sizing, and locations of energy generation and storage technologies to minimize both costs and carbon emissions. The thermal network is represented with a simplified linear approximation. The DHN simulation model is a thermal-hydraulic model to address the non-linear operational performance regarding hourly heat losses, pumping energy, and temperature distribution along with the network. The discrepancies in the network's costs and operational performances from the two models are identified. The MILP model is further improved by adding new constraints. Results from both MILP models are compared and demonstrated with a case study. It reveals that the state-of-art MILPmodel with simplified network representation suffices for optimal selection and sizing for most of the technologies. Although more computationally intensive, the refined model can address the operational issues with distributed design solutions.					wang, danhong/M-2699-2014														2296-598X					JUN 23	2021	9								668124	10.3389/fenrg.2021.668124	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.668124													WOS:000670318500001
J	Wu, C; Barnes, D				Wu, Chong; Barnes, David			A dynamic feedback model for partner selection in agile supply chains	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a four-phase dynamic feedback model for supply partner selection in agile supply chains (ASCs). ASCs are commonly used as a response to increasingly dynamic markets. However, partner selection in ASCs is inherently more complex and difficult under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity as supply chains form and re-form. Design/methodology/approach - The model draws on both quantitative and qualitative techniques, including the Dempster-Shafer and optimisation theories, radial basis function artificial neural net:works (RBF-ANN), analytic network process-mixed integer multi-objective programming (ANP-MIMOP), Kraljic's supplier classification matrix and principles of continuous improvement. It incorporates modern computer programming techniques to overcome the information processing difficulties inherent in selecting from amongst large numbers of potential suppliers against multiple criteria in conditions of uncertainty. Findings - The model enables decision makers to make efficient and effective use of the vastly increased amount of data that is available in today's information-driven society and it offers a comprehensive, systematic and rigorous approach to a complex problem. Research limitations/implications - The model has two main drawbacks. First, practitioners may find it difficult to match supplier evaluation criteria with the strategic objectives for an ASC. Second, they may perceive the model to be too complex for use when speed is of the essence. Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper is that, for the first time, it draws together work from previous articles that have described each of the four stages of the model in detail to present a comprehensive overview of the model.

Most existing algorithms for constraint satisfaction require input consisting of binary constraints on variables that have discrete values. Such restrictions limit their use in structural engineering since typical structural design tasks involve discrete and numerical variables. This paper provides an approach for decision support through approximating solution spaces of such constraint problems by local consistency. The approach is demonstrated for the selection of appropriate wind bracing for single story steel-framed buildings involving more than hundred variables. Finally, extension to conditional constraint satisfaction using different combinations of activation conditions is straightforward.																					0-7923-6353-1				2000							311	331																WOS:000089944200016

It has been difficult to meet the needs of the field with the usual prediction model of mechanical properties of hot-rolled strip. Insufficient data and difficult parameter adjustment limit deep learning models based on multi-layer networks in practical applications; besides, the limited discrete process parameters used make it impossible to effectively depict the actual strip processing process. In order to solve these problems, this research proposed a new sampling approach for mechanical characteristics input data of hot-rolled strip based on the multi-grained cascade forest (gcForest) framework. According to the characteristics of complex process flow and abnormal sensitivity of process path and parameters to product quality in the hot-rolled strip production, a three-dimensional continuous time series process data sampling method based on time-temperature-deformation was designed. The basic information of strip steel (chemical composition and typical process parameters) is fused with the local process information collected by multi-grained scanning, so that the next link's input has both local and global features. Furthermore, in the multi-grained scanning structure, a sub sampling scheme with a variable window was designed, so that input data with different dimensions can get output characteristics of the same dimension after passing through the multi-grained scanning structure, allowing the cascade forest structure to be trained normally. Finally, actual production data of three steel grades was used to conduct the experimental evaluation. The results revealed that the gcForest-based mechanical property prediction model outperforms the competition in terms of comprehensive performance, ease of parameter adjustment, and ability to sustain high prediction accuracy with fewer samples.					wang, wei/JYP-7819-2024; wang, xin/JWA-3772-2024; li, tao/JVO-9006-2024; li, mengyang/JWO-9551-2024; Wang, Hao/ABB-8923-2020; Zhang, Bo/JVD-9890-2024; chen, yan/JRY-4645-2023; lin, yuan/JXL-9592-2024; Chen, Feng/JQW-8742-2023; li, fei/JYP-3334-2024; li, rui/JVM-8999-2024; LI, SHA/JNR-9956-2023; LI, LI/KCJ-5600-2024; wang, yi/JYO-8193-2024; zhang, xinyi/JWA-0980-2024; Li, YU/JQV-2716-2023; Zhang, Shiwei/JIY-4344-2023; Zhang, Yuan/JUF-7293-2023; Li, J N/JXL-5833-2024; Wang, Yue/JRY-8962-2023; Wang, Xin/JVE-0200-2024; wang, xi/JNT-5162-2023; Yang, Fan/JVO-8611-2024; Li, Feifei/JTT-8011-2023; Yu, Yue/JWP-9103-2024; Li, Yan/JUU-5189-2023; Li, Xinyue/JVN-4601-2024; Zhang, Jun/JPK-7723-2023; Li, Yan/JRW-0176-2023; wang, jiajun/JRW-6032-2023; Yang, Shu/JUU-4592-2023; Liu, qi/JZT-5038-2024; zhao, lin/JPK-8436-2023; tian, ye/KGL-6485-2024; chen, huan/KEC-2019-2024; li, li/JVP-2971-2024; chen, yue/JXW-9556-2024; zhang, ying/JQX-1479-2023; wang, jiaqi/JSL-7112-2023; li, jiaxin/JNT-5073-2023; song, yong/HJI-6403-2023; LI, YUN/JTV-7108-2023; Zhang, Yusi/JNS-2335-2023	Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9109-6017; Wang, Yue/0000-0001-8673-6358; song, yong/0000-0003-2779-7075; 													1674-4799	1869-103X				JUN	2023	30	6					1093	1103		10.1007/s12613-022-2536-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12613-022-2536-y													WOS:000972340500009

Numerical modeling of influence parameters in cavabililty of rock mass in block caving mines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES												The prediction of rock mass cavability is needed in the design of block caves to estimate the undercut size required to achieve continuous caving. The cavability of the rock mass will control mine design and economic issues for a given geological environment and is a fundamental issue in establishing a successful block caving mine. With recent interest in applying caving techniques to stronger rock masses, the reliable prediction of rock mass cavability is becoming increasingly important. The two most universally applied methods for cavability prediction are the empirical stability graph approach developed by Laubscher and numerical methods. Empirical approaches developed to predict rock mass cavability have been based on the assessment of rock mass conditions using recognized rock mass classification schemes. Rock mass classification is the first stage in empirical approaches to predicting rock mass cavability. The numerical approaches also commonly utilize rock mass classification schemes to assign rock mass properties and apply failure criteria within the models. A reliable prediction of cavability of rock mass depends on the accurate identification of the influence parameters in rock mass cavability. The cavability of a rock mass is based on many factors such as natural and induced factors, affect the caving performance. In this paper the effect of seven parameters, the compressive strength of intact rock (UCS), joint orientation, joint persistence, joint density (P-32), joint friction, confined stress and hydraulic radius (HR), is investigated using numerical technique named the Synthetic Rock Mass (SRM). The SRM is a numerical modeling technique which combines the Bonded Particle Model (PFC) for intact rock and Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) simulation. To assess the influence of each parameter in numerical modeling, the value of one parameter is changing while the values of other six parameters are fixed. It is found that in-situ stress and hydraulic radius are the most effective parameters in cavability of rock mass in block caving mines.

The introduced control has three main characteristics: (1) the tracking error is used instead of the estimation error in the weights learning equations, avoiding the requirement of a good behavior estimation of the unknown elements in the nonlinear model, (2) the projection method is suggested to avoid the overfitting in the control law, and (3) the Lyapunov technique is utilized to assure the uniform stability of the tracking and weights errors. The suggested technique is applied in two nonlinear processes: the inverted-car and Furuta pendulums. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It relies on a visual representation of design process. The technique allows the user to select a suitable network configuration and to directly control all the network elements for successful fabrication.

The Square Root Multipliers Algorithm for Discrete Capacity and Buffer Assignment problems in Elastic Traffic Networks	AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS												This paper discusses a novel approach for the dimensioning of packet networks, under the constraints of end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. The network modeling also considers the dynamic behavior of today's networks traffic. In particular, the proposed approach considers multilink networks where discrete capacities are the decision variables. This Discrete Capacity Assignment (DCA) problem can be classified as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem and therefore it is NP-complete. In order to solve the problem, we propose the Square Root Multipliers Algorithm (SRMA) followed by a Randomized Rounding (RR) method. We also enforce loss probability constraints by properly choosing buffer sizes, therefore facing the Buffer Assignment (BA) problem. To evaluate the performance of our approach, SRMA/RR results are compared with the optimal solutions found by an exhaustive search (ES) procedure. Analytical results for a variety of problem instances are reported, and a verification is performed based on simulations conducted with the software NS-2. The results suggest that the proposed approach provides a quite efficient method to obtain near-optimal solutions with small computational effort. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The system measurements are collected through sensor networks with sensors distributed according to a given topology. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a set of time-varying estimators such that the average estimation performance of the networked sensors is guaranteed over a given finite-horizon. Through available output measurements from not only the individual sensor but also its neighboring sensors, a necessary and sufficient condition is established to achieve the H-infinity performance constraint, and then the estimator design scheme is proposed via a certain H-2-type criterion. The desired estimator parameters can be obtained by solving coupled backward recursive Riccati difference equations (RDEs). A numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed estimator design approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the nonlinear property and the unknown functions are included in the considered reactor, it leads to a completed task for designing the controller. Based on the approximation property of the neural networks, several unknown functions are approximated. The main contribution of this paper is that a more general class of CSTR is controlled. A novel recursive design method is used to remove the interconnection term. It is proven that the proposed algorithm can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the system output can converge to a neighborhood of zero based on the Lyapunov analysis method. A simulation example for continuous stirred tank reactor is illustrated to verify the validity of the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Use of an Integrated Discrete Fracture Network Code for Stochastic Stability Analyses of Fractured Rock Masses	ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING												The paper presents the Discrete Fracture Network code RESOBLOK, which couples geometrical block system construction and a quick iterative stability analysis in the same package. The deterministic or stochastic geometry of a fractured rock mass can be represented and interactively displayed in 3D using two different fracture generators: one mainly used for hydraulic purposes and another designed to allow block stability evaluation. RESOBLOK has downstream modules that can quickly compute stability (based on limit equilibrium or energy-based analysis), display geometric information and create links to other discrete software. The advantage of the code is that it couples stochastic geometrical representation and a quick iterative stability analysis to allow risk-analysis with or without reinforcement and, for the worst cases, more accurate analysis using stress-strain analysis computer codes.

By incorporating generalized quadratic Lyapunov function with the discrete-time Bellman-Gronwall inequality, a new upper bound about the quantization precision parameter of the infinite-level logarithmic quantizer is derived to design quantized protocol, under which agents in strongly connected directed networks can attain weighted average consensus. The obtained new upper bound clearly characterizes the intimate relation between the quantization precision parameter and the directed network topology. The proposed quantized protocol is particularly applicable to digital networks where balanced message passing among agents is not available.

Semistability is the property whereby every solution that starts in a neighborhood of a Lyapunov stable equilibrium converges to a (possibly different) Lyapunov stable equilibrium. To this end, we use a Lyapunov-based approach to develop a series of sufficient conditions for semistability of discrete-time switched systems. This technique gives us a new perspective to design distributed numerical iterative algorithms for network systems from a dynamical systems viewpoint. Despite the fact that distributed iterative algorithms in general are not dynamical systems, the methods we used for proving convergence of dynamical systems are somehow valid for a large class of distributed iterative algorithms in network systems. The motivation of this paper exactly follows from this general observation. Part of the effort by this paper can be viewed as an attempt to analyze distributed numerical algorithms for network systems from a control perspective.																			0743-1619	2378-5861	978-1-4577-0081-1				2011							2602	2606																WOS:000295376003052

An analysis of the water supply situation during transition from intermittent to continuous supply in a referent sector called Riberas de Sacramento was carried out on the behavior of the network, the operating criteria of the system and the demand of the sector. For the consumption analysis, three consecutive years of data collected by government institution from micro meters were analyzed. In order to characterize the hybrid demand pattern to operate the network, prior site analysis determined the minimum amounts of pressures and consumption records to obtain series of data for analysis. After the review of the transition from intermittent to continuous water supply and the establishment of methodology to characterize the hybrid demand pattern, the need for a hybrid demand pattern is required, and this experiment design gives part to achieve it.

J	Tian, EG; Yue, D				Tian, Engang; Yue, Dong			Decentralized fuzzy <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> filtering for networked interconnected systems under communication constraints	NEUROCOMPUTING												This study investigates decentralized fuzzy Ho, filtering for a class of network-based interconnected systems. The considered system has the following main features: (1) it is a nonlinear system approximated by a T-S fuzzy model; (2) subsystems are connected through wired or wireless networks and therefore signal transfer in/among subsystems is subject to communication delay and/or packet loss; and (3) the network transmission capacity is limited. A discrete decentralized event-triggering scheme (DDETS) is proposed to overcome the network bandwidth limitation, which can reduce data transmission in subsystems effectively. By employing the above main features and using the DDETS, a new system model is proposed. Then the Lyapunov functional approach is applied to development of two stability conditions (Theorems 1 and 2), which are used to design filters and triggering matrices of each subsystem simultaneously. Finally, an example is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, YC; Chien, CJ				Wang, Ying-Chung; Chien, Chiang-Ju			Design and Analysis of Fuzzy-Neural Discrete Adaptive Iterative Learning Control for Nonlinear Plants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS												In this paper, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) based discrete adaptive iterative learning controller (AILC) is proposed for a class of discrete-time uncertain nonlinear plants which can repeat a given task over a finite time sequence. Compared with the existing discrete AILC schemes, the proposed strategy can be applied to the discrete-time uncertain nonlinear plants with not only initial resetting errors and iteration-varying desired trajectory, but also random bounded disturbances and unknown non-Lipschitz plant nonlinearities. Two FNNs are used as approximators to compensate for the unknown plant nonlinearities. To overcome the function approximation error and possibly large random bounded disturbance, a time-varying boundary layer is introduced to design an auxiliary error function. The auxiliary error function is then utilized to derive the adaptive laws since the optimal FNN parameters for a good function approximation and the optimal width of time-varying boundary layer are unavailable. By using a Lyapunov like analysis, we show that the closed-loop is stable in the sense that the adjustable parameters and internal signals are bounded for all the iterations. Furthermore, learning performance is guaranteed in the sense that the norm of output tracking error vector will asymptotically converge to a residual set which is bounded by the width of boundary layer.																			1562-2479	2199-3211				JUN	2013	15	2					149	158																WOS:000322925500006

This paper presents a biologically inspired discrete-event modeling approach for simulating alternative computer network protocols. This approach identifies and incorporates the key attributes of honeybees and their societal properties into simulation models that are formalized according to the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism. We describe our approach with particular emphasis on how to model the individual honeybees and their cooperation. These models, collectively referred to as SwarmNet, support routing algorithms akin to honeybees searching for and foraging on food. Adaptation and probabilistic specifications are introduced into honeybee (BEE) and Routing Information Protocol (RIP) routing algorithms.

Optimal Design of the Cross-docking in Distribution Networks: Heuristic Solution Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING												Cross-docking plays an importation role in distribution networks. In the recent years, a cross-docking design network problem is addressed as a new research area in logistics management. This paper presents a new mathematical model for the location of cross-docking facilities and vehicle routing scheduling problems in the distribution networks. For this purpose, a two-phase mixed-integer programming (MIP) is formulated. Then, a new heuristic-based simulated annealing (SA) is developed for solving the proposed MIP model. Finally, the presented heuristic algorithm is subsequently tested on a number of small and large-scale instances. The computational results for different-sized instances illustrate that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in a reasonable time.

The communication constraints such as network-induced delay, packet disorder, and packet dropout are considered, which are treated as the round-trip time (RTT) delay with an upper bound. An event-driven networked predictive control scheme is proposed to actively compensate for the RTT delay, which avoids the requirement of synchronization between the controller side and the plant side. The stability of the closed-loop system and the design procedure of the observer-based controller are discussed. A numerical example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Owing to the diversity and complexity of time-delays, it is difficult to accurately predict their information. Under the boundedness of activation functions, the delay-depend term is regarded as a bounded nonlinear disturbance. Two event-triggered estimators are designed to estimate the neuron states. The first one considers the case that the system states are subject to unknown time-delay, and the second one deals with the case that both the system states and measurement outputs are subject to unknown time-delay. The sufficient conditions are developed to guarantee the input-to-state practical stability of estimation error systems. Finally, the dynamic event-triggered strategy is introduced to further reduce the events. Two numerical examples are given to show the validity of the developed scheme.

In this paper, time-varying delays are regarded as the sum of the mean delays and uncertain delays. Furthermore, NCS with long time delays is modelled as a discrete-time model with structural uncertainty for its time-varying network-induced delays. Based on the model, a new control law via an iterative linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is presented which can stabilize the closed-loop system. Theoretical analysis and simulation results compared to some existing schemes show that the control strategy presented in this paper is effective and feasible.

The performance of data collection can be measured by its achievable network capacity. However, most existing works focus on the network capacity of unicast, multicast or/and broadcast. In this article, we study the snapshot/continuous data collection (SDC/CDC) problem under the physical interference model for randomly deployed dense WSNs. For SDC, we propose a Cell-Based Path Scheduling (CBPS) algorithm based on network partitioning. Theoretical analysis shows that its achievable network capacity is order-optimal. For CDC, a novel Segment-Based Pipeline Scheduling (SBPS) algorithm is proposed which combines the pipeline technique and the compressive data gathering technique. Theoretical analysis shows that SBPS significantly speeds up the CDC process and achieves a high network capacity.

J	Sahoo, S				Sahoo, Sankar			Colouring of Mixed Fuzzy Graph and its Application in COVID19	JOURNAL OF MULTIPLE-VALUED LOGIC AND SOFT COMPUTING												Graph colouring is used in many applications in real-world systems, including traffic light signalling, map colouring, etc. In social networks, some users follow the profiles of some selected popular users. So, these networks can be designed by directed graphs. Some users do not follow the profiles of others, but they are still connected. So, directed edges and undirected edges are very much useful in social networks. In this paper, a new type of fuzzy graph "Mixed Fuzzy Graph" has been introduced. Colouring of such graphs is defined. Along with this, the chromatic number and strong chromatic number are provided, and related properties are investigated. A numerical application of COVID19 affected networks has been presented using the colouring of mixed fuzzy graphs.																			1542-3980	1542-3999					2020	35	5-6					473	489																WOS:000681356700004

This network consists of many parallel open circuit microstrip lines, each corresponding to a quarter of wavelength for different frequencies. This topology can improve efficiency and bandwidth by controlling harmonic match impedance. The harmonic and the fundamental matching networks can be designed simultaneously to reduce the mutual effect between them. We also design and fabricate a highly efficient PA with more than an octave bandwidth to verify the validity of the proposed network structure. The measured results show that the fractional bandwidth is 82.9% from 1.2 to 2.9 GHz. The drain efficiency that can be achieved is 86.06% and the maximum output power is 42.97 dBm when the input power is 30 dBm between 1.2 and 2.9 GHz.					lin, lin/KCZ-0185-2024	Zhang, Zhiwei/0000-0001-8001-9606													0895-2477	1098-2760				NOV	2022	64	11					1965	1971		10.1002/mop.33408	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mop.33408		JUL 2022											WOS:000825254400001

To reduce the computational cost of standard GA, two different strategies are used. The first strategy is by modifying the standard GA, called virtual sub-population method (VSP). The second strategy is by using artificial neural networks for approximating the structural analysis. In this study, radial basis function (RBF), counter propagation (CP) and generalized regression (GR) neural networks are used. Using neural networks within the framework of VSP creates a robust too] for optimum design of structures. (C) 2005 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Turk, T				Turk, Tomaz			System dynamics simulation of computer networks: Price-controlled QoS framework	MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION												The dynamics of computer networks was until recently modelled mostly with discrete-event simulations and queuing systems. Modem computer networks are becoming large and complex, and discrete-event simulation schemes are too slow to successfully model their behavior. Researchers and engineers are switching to more novel approaches, like fluid simulation schemes, where network elements are described as fluid servers which process workload continuously, yet the traffic source can be of arbitrary type, including discrete-event source and fluid source. We are developing this idea further and propose even simpler schema, using the systems dynamics simulation approach in our schema, the network topology and routing information is represented by relatively simple matrix algebra. The schema can be used to model computer systems for various purposes, from the topology and capacity design and optimization in every day practice, to more theoretical work like testing new technology and policy approaches. Besides the formal description of the proposed schema, the paper also gives an example of its adaptation to model the behavior of a price-controlled end-to-end QoS provision in computer networks.

Our analysis shows that Such DTCNNs have periodic solutions and closed invariant curves, and all their solutions, except for fixed points, eventually stay on the closed invariant curves. Moreover, these results are also illustrated by examples and figures. These results demonstrate that excitatory-inhibitory DTCNNs can exhibit permanent nonlinear oscillations. Moreover, Such DTCNNs with permanent nonlinear oscillations may be chosen arbitrarily to close a DTCNN satisfying the SP-Condition which ensures the complete stability of DTCNNs.

This superstructure combines the water network and heat exchanger network using interconnecting hot and cold streams. The water network has been extended for both direct and indirect heat exchanges. In addition, opportunities for heat integration between hot and cold streams, splitting and mixing of the freshwater and wastewater streams are incorporated within the superstructure. The proposed model is formulated as a non-convex MINLP (mixed-integer non-linear program), where the objective is to minimize the total annual costs of the network. A new convex hull formulation is presented for identifying the streams' roles within the network. Three examples involving single and multiple contaminant problems are presented in order to illustrate the applicability and capabilities of the proposed superstructure and model. In all cases the resultant networks exhibit lower total annual costs, whilst the freshwater and utilities consumption are the same as reported in the literature.

The most common multichannel concepts are multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and phased array architectures. In this paper, we present a transmitter monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) in a SiGe BiCMOS technology for its application, a mixed-mode frequency modulated continuous wave radar that is able to operate in both ways, in an MIMO and a beamforming mode. The MIMO mode is used for medium range and fast 3-D scans and the phased array mode is used for beamforming. This mode increases the effective output power of the transmitted signal beam and thus system dynamic and detection range. For this purpose, we developed ultrawideband quadrature (IQ) generation techniques to generate synchronous IQ-signals in each channel of our system to feed a vector adder, which is capable of shifting the phase for beamforming. The developed IQ-generation circuits are able to operate from 1 to 30 GHz, and the complete radar transmitter MMIC, including a power amplifier (PA), operates from 11 to 20 GHz. The IQ-generation phase error in this frequency range is below 6 degrees and below 9 degrees/3.2 degrees rms for the IQ-generation together with vector modulator. The power consumption is 285 mW and the PA consumes 1.25 W with a maximum output power of the complete multimode TX MMIC of 24.4 dBm at 15 GHz.

Because of the very geometric nature of their failure, analyzing and modeling such strutures is more a geometry processing problem than one of classical continuum mechanics. This paper uses the thrust network method of analysis and presents an iterative nonlinear optimization algorithm for efficiently approximating freeform shapes by self-supporting ones. The rich geometry of thrust networks leads us to close connections between diverse topics in discrete differential geometry, such as a finite-element discretization of the Airy stress potential, perfect graph Laplacians, and computing admissible loads via curvatures of polyhedral surfaces. This geometric viewpoint allows us, in particular, to remesh self-supporting shapes by self-supporting quad meshes with planar faces, and leads to another application of the theory: steel/glass constructions with low moments in nodes.

A centralized controller, which communicates with the subsystems through a packet-based communication network, is designed to guarantee the uniform boundedness of the trajectories of the overall closed-loop system. In order to cope with disturbances and time-varying transmission delays which typically affect networked control systems, a network delay compensation strategy based on acknowledgments and time-stamping of data packets is adopted.

Among the predominant topics treated in the literature, we focus on two different, but related problem classes. One can be described by the notion of network design, while the other is more aptly termed by network operation. The basic underlying model in both cases is a nonlinear network flow model, and we give an overview on the more specific modeling aspects in each case. The overall mathematical model is a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program having a common structure with respect to how water dynamics in pipes are described. Finally, we survey the algorithmic approaches to solve the proposed problems and we discuss computation on various types of water networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The LSTM network is designed to effectively exhibit the dynamic behavior of the wind power time series. The discrete wavelet transform is introduced to decompose the non-stationary wind power time series into several components which have more stationarity and are easier to predict. Each component is dug by an independent LSTM. The forecasting results of the wind power are obtained by synthesizing the prediction values of all components. The prediction accuracy has been improved by the proposed method, which is validated by the MAE (mean absolute error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), and RMSE (root mean square error) of experimental results of three wind farms as the benchmarks. Wind power forecasting based on the proposed method provides an alternative way to improve the security and stability of the electric power network with the high penetration of wind power.

The investigation employed 250 Bloom gelatins with distinct properties and GS with varying dextrose equivalence (DE). Microstructural analyses of mixtures were conducted using inverted fluorescent microscopy both immediately after blending at 80 degrees C and following a 24-h incubation at different temperatures. Visual observation as well as rheological, thermal and textural analyses were employed to monitor bulk phase separation occurring at 45 and 60 degrees C and gel properties upon cooling. Upon mixing, a diverse range of morphologies emerged, ranging from single-phase configurations to bicontinuous, protein-in-polysaccharide, and polysaccharide-in-protein arrangements, which was attributed to the immiscibility between gelatin and the DP10+ polysaccharides in the GS beyond a concentration threshold and potentially driven by the molecular ordering of gelatin and the shear forces during mixing. The miscibility of polymers and the nature of continuous phase were markedly influenced by the dosage and properties of gelatin (MW and pI) and GS (DE). During incubation at 60 or 45 degrees C, structural rearrangement occurred, with certain compositions undergoing substantial bulk separation. Rapid cooling effectively arrested the initial microstruc-tures, giving rise to the formation of turbid gel networks. Comparative analysis of the gel properties indicated that GS generally promoted the formation of gelatin gels, but excessive addition of low DE GS proved coun-terproductive to proper gel development, resulting in the formation of soft, weakly structured gels prone to syneresis or even outright nongelation.

The associated processes are discrete (in time and space), asynchronous (event-driven rather than clock-driven) and generative (non-deterministic). In recent years a theory has emerged of the control of DES, in a setting of finite automata and regular languages; the theory has found application to a range of industrial control processes.

To further improve the coverage rate of movable wireless sensor networks under the condition of guaranteed connectivity, this paper proposes an adaptive, discrete space oriented wolf pack optimization algorithm for a movable wireless sensor network (DSO-WPOA). Firstly, a strategy of adaptive expansion based on a minimum overlapping full-coverage model is designed to achieve minimum overlap and no-gap coverage for the monitoring area. Moreover, the adaptive shrinking grid search wolf pack optimization algorithm (ASGS-CWOA) is improved to optimize the movable wireless sensor network, which is a discrete space oriented problem. This improvement includes the usage of a target-node probability matrix and the design of an adaptive step size method, both of which work together to enhance the convergence speed and global optimization ability of the algorithm. Theoretical research and experimental results indicate that compared with the coverage algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO-WSN) and classical virtual force algorithm, the newly proposed algorithm possesses the best coverage rate, better stability, acceptable performance in terms of time, advantages in energy savings, and no gaps.																				1424-8220				OCT	2019	19	19							4320	10.3390/s19194320	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19194320								31590441					WOS:000494823200264

Stability and stabilization of Boolean networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												The stability of Boolean networks and the stabilization of Boolean control networks are investigated. Using semi-tensor product of matrices and the matrix expression of logic, the dynamics of a Boolean (control) network can be converted to a discrete time linear (bilinear) dynamics, called the algebraic form of the Boolean (control) network. Then the stability can be revealed by analyzing the transition matrix of the corresponding discrete time system. Main results consist of two parts: (i) Using logic coordinate transformation, the known sufficient condition based on incidence matrix has been improved. It can also be used in stabilizer design. (ii) Based on algebraic form, necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and stabilization, respectively, are obtained.

Dynamic event-triggered control for discrete-time nonlinear Markov jump systems using policy iteration-based adaptive dynamic programming	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS												This paper investigates a dynamic event-triggered optimal control problem of discrete-time (DT) nonlinear Markov jump systems (MJSs) via exploring policy iteration (PI) adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms. The performance index function (PIF) defined in each subsystem is updated by utilizing an online PI algorithm, and the corresponding control policy is derived via solving the optimal PIF. Then, we adopt neural network (NN) techniques, including an actor network and a critic network, to estimate the iterative PIF and control policy. Moreover, the designed dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is employed to avoid wasting additional resources when the estimated iterative control policy is updated. Finally, based on the Lyapunov difference method, it is proved that the system stability and the convergence of all signals can be guaranteed under the developed control scheme. A simulation example for DT nonlinear MJSs with two system modes is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the control design scheme.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is beneficial to compare different mixes and examine their performances and the associated costs. However, designing and comparing concrete mixes by hand can be time consuming and is prone to errors. Hence, in this work, algorithms were developed and implemented for six mix design methods, which replaced the time-consuming hand calculations with error-free and fast ones, in a user-friendly fashion. The programs successfully designed concrete mixes ranging from 10 to 160 MPa 28-day compressive strengths with minimal errors and provided estimates of the cost of each mix. Also, using the developed programs, methods were compared regarding their suggested concrete ingredients' quantities, associated cost, and general trends. Preliminary comparisons between mix design methods showed that design methods suggest similar mix proportions for a given compressive strength. Further, it was found that designing a mix using ACI method can be costly compared with the other methods. These findings and others would have been difficult to be revealed using traditional methods of mix design. More importantly, the comparisons presented in this work are only a few of the unlimited comparisons that can be easily made between normal and high strength mix design methods, which will unravel other key differences between mix design methods. Such comparisons are vital to engineers to be able to make informed decisions regarding which mix to use from strength, workability, durability, and cost point of views.

Trajectory optimisation of satellite launch vehicles using network flow-based algorithm	AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL												A trajectory optimisation procedure is addressed to generate a reference trajectory for Satellite Launch Vehicles (SLVs). Using a grid-based discrete scheme, a Modified Minimum Cost Network Flow (MCNF)-based algorithm over a large-scale network is proposed. By using the network grid around the Earth and the discrete dynamic equations of motion, the optimum trajectory from a launch point to the desired orbit is obtained exactly by minimisation of a cost functional subject to the nonlinear dynamics and mission constraints of the SLV. Several objectives such as the flight time and terminal conditions may be assigned to each arc in the network. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm to generate an admissible trajectory in the minimum possible time compared with previous works.																			0001-9240	2059-6464				DEC	2020	124	1282					1849	1864		10.1017/aer.2020.90	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aer.2020.90													WOS:000591622500001

In establishing coordination among sensors such that they can access the shared wireless medium, Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol plays an important role. In this article, we presented an analytical study on some popular MAC protocols for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Based on the design techniques, MAC protocols for WSNs are classified into two main categories: single-layer and cross-layer. MAC protocols such as S-MAC, T-MAC, B-MAC and X-MAC are selected to study the design approaches of single-layer genre. BoX-MAC-1 and BoX-MAC-2 are selected to analyze cross-layer design approaches. This survey paper aims at reporting an implementation viewpoint of different design approaches of MAC protocols in WSN. We have considered mixed WSNs that exhibits node movement (e.g., static, mobile) and changes in communication medium (e.g., air, water). Representative protocols are implemented in Castalia simulator and evaluated on the basis of important performance metrics such as energy consumption, network lifetime, throughput and end-to-end delay. The merits and demerits of different protocols are also compared. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Different from some existing research results, both probability characteristic and upper bound of consecutive packet dropouts are involved in the proposed approach of controller design. First, an error dynamical network with stochastic and bounded delay is established by step-delay method, where the randomness of the bounded delay can be verified later by the probability theory method. A new modeling method is introduced to reflect the probability characteristic of consecutive packet dropouts. Based on the proposed model, some sufficient conditions are proposed under which the error dynamical network is globally exponentially synchronized in the mean square sense. Subsequently, a probability-distribution-dependent controller design procedure is then proposed. Finally, two numerical examples with simulations are provided to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the less conservatism of the proposed model method.

OFF-blocks in between ON-blocks can however, also be seen as a proxy for intermittent periods of resting, inducing temporary resting-states. We still do not know if brain activity during such intermittent periods reflects the same kind of resting-state activity as that obtained during a continuous period, as is typically the case in studies of the classic Default Mode Network (DMN). The purpose of the current study was therefore to investigate both similarities and differences in brain activity between intermittent and continuous resting conditions. MethodsThere were 47 healthy participants in the 3T fMRI experiment. Data for the intermittent resting-state condition were acquired from resting-periods in between active task-processing periods in a standard ON-OFF block design, with three different cognitive tasks presented during ON-blocks. Data for the continuous resting-state condition were acquired during a 5 min resting period after the task-design had been presented. Results and discussionThe results showed that activity was overall similar in the two conditions, but with some differences. These differences were within the DMN network, and for the interaction of DMN with other brain networks. DMN maps showed weak overlap between conditions in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and in particular for the intermittent compared to the continuous resting-state condition. Moreover, DMN showed strong connectivity with the salience network (SN) in the intermittent resting-state condition, particularly in the anterior insula and the supramarginal gyrus. The observed differences may reflect a "carry-over" effect from task-processing to the next resting-state period, not present in the continuous resting-state condition, causing interference from the ON-blocks. Further research is needed to fully understand the extent of differences between intermittent and continuous resting-state conditions.

A simultaneous optimization approach mathematically combines the problems of wastewater and heat exchanger network optimization into a single step. This process includes two global iterations of a similar two-stage approach and optimizes networks for water and heat exchange simultaneously based on cost estimation. The objective function is to minimize the total annual cost of the wastewater and heat exchange network design which is subject to the mass and energy balance constraints on all the pertinent flows and to constraints related to the concentrations of contaminants. The proposed method employs a strategy to address a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) formulation. Cost estimates for optimized wastewater and heat exchange networks for an oil refinery process are generated, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the energy-saving effect of intermittent ventilation strategies in industrial exhaust ventilation systems. First, the intermittent ventilation strategy under the ideal well-mixed ventilation model was studied. Next, the energy-saving effects of (vortex ventilation (VV) and downward-supply/upward-exhaust (DU) modes) on the intermittent ventilation strategy were compared. We used a genetic algorithm to accurately optimize the intermittent ventilation strategy, and a prediction model of indoor pollutants was established by combining computational fluid dynamics simulation results with an artificial neural network model. The results show that for an ideal well-mixed ventilation model, the main factors affecting the energy-saving effect of the intermittent ventilation strategy include the upper limit of the indoor pollutant concentration, durability of the fan, and operating air volume. With the upper limit of the indoor pollutant concentration and durability of the fan, the ventilation system may increase the operating air volume, often resulting in an increase in energy consumption for the intermittent ventilation strategy, possibly even higher than that of the continuous ventilation strategy. Moreover, when considering the ventilation air distribution mode, the time to reach stable airflow state also significantly affects the energy consumption of the intermittent ventilation strategy. When satisfying the time required to reach a steady airflow state, the ventilation system with the intermittent ventilation strategy can significantly reduce energy consumption, in which the energy consumption of the DU and VV modes is reduced by 44.17-62.25% and 51.69-60.68%, respectively.					bai, yu/KHU-2608-2024															2352-7102				JUN 15	2023	69								106242	10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106242		MAR 2023											WOS:001042196900001
J	Sun, ST; Li, XD				Sun, Shu-Ting; Li, Xiao-Dong			Robust networked ILC for switched nonlinear discrete systems with non-repetitive uncertainties and random data dropouts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE												In this article, a robust networked iterative learning control (ILC) method is presented for switched nonlinear discrete-time systems (NDTS) subject to non-repetitive uncertainties and random data dropouts. In the proposed robust networked ILC scheme, the switching law, iterative initial state, and disturbances, all of which vary with iterations, are well addressed. Corresponding to the actuator side and the measurement side of the networked switched NDTS, the random data dropouts occurred are compensated by the input signals at last iteration and the reference outputs, respectively. As a result, it is theoretically proved that under the non-repetitive uncertainties of the switched NDTS, the mathematical expectation of ILC tracking error remains bounded during the ILC process. While the non-repetitive uncertainties are progressively convergent in iteration domain, a precise tracking to the reference trajectory in mathematical expectation sense can be achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed networked ILC design is validated by a numerical example.																			0020-7721	1464-5319				JUL 4	2021	52	9					1746	1760		10.1080/00207721.2020.1869855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2020.1869855		JAN 2021											WOS:000611958500001

A feedback control method is introduced to drive such SCNs to achieve inner synchronization in mean square. Different from previous researches, the feedback control we designed is based on discrete-time state observations. Moreover, by exploiting Lyapunov method and Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem in graph theory, some sufficient criteria are obtained to guarantee synchronization in mean square and asymptotical synchronization in mean square of SCNs. What is more, we make use of the theoretical results to analyze asymptotical synchronization in mean square of second-order Kuramoto oscillators with time delay and stochastic disturbances and get a sufficient criterion.

The discrete-time heterogeneous multi-agent systems are described by first-order and second-order dynamics, and the communication network is assumed to be directed with fixed topology. Since each link between the agents is subject to failure with a certain probability, the control protocol is designed considering the random link failures. The random link failures are presented by a Bernoulli probability sequence, that is, the control protocol for failure occurrence is designed using the one step previous data that is sent by adjacency neighbouring agents. The control protocol for heterogeneous multi-agent systems is designed for first-order dynamics and second-order dynamics using the Lyapunov method. The mean square stability is shown for leaderless and leader-following heterogeneous multi-agent systems in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities, and some simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

First of all, an event-triggered scheme is introduced to this system for reducing the unnecessary waste of limited network bandwidth resources. Considering the effect of time-varying delay, a new mathematical model for this system is constructed.

To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation example considering a main steam temperature cascade control system is given. The proposed method emphasizes the application in the corresponding industrial control systems, it can be found that this method is superior to the one in some existing references, and the provided example demonstrates the effectiveness of the co-design method in the networked cascade control systems with event-triggered scheme.

Most traditional bipartite network embedding methods only consider the explicit network structure, but ignore semantic relations and rating information therein. To solve this deficiency, we designed a new bipartite network embedding approach based on the Constrained Random Walk and Mixed-Skipgram (CRWMS). Specifically, we propose a constrained random walk strategy that produces the mixed local sampling sequences, and further adopt the splitting operation to preserve both explicit and implicit structural information. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective mixed-skipgram model to discern node representation vectors through joint training of explicit and implicit structural sequences. We compare CRWMS with five state-of-the-art network embedding methods on three real-world bipartite networks. Experiments show that our approach improves performance in edge classification, edge clustering, recommendation and link reconstruction tasks.																			1742-6588	1742-6596					2020	1642								012006	10.1088/1742-6596/1642/1/012006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1642/1/012006													WOS:000630893700006

To solve the aforementioned trajectory control problem, a nonlinear networked predictive control strategy based on the discrete sliding mode framework is proposed. Initially, using the forward Euler discretization method, a novel discrete virtual velocity control law is designed to transform trajectory tracking control into virtual velocity tracking control. Then, a sliding mode controller is suggested to suppress external disturbance of the USV. In addition, a networked sliding mode predictive control (NSMPC) scheme is proffered to guarantee active compensation of the communication constraints and stability of the trajectory tracking system simultaneously. Afterward, a theoretical analysis is given to show that the closed -loop system is uniformly bounded stable after the introduction of the digital network. Finally, extensive comparative simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.																			0029-8018	1873-5258				APR 15	2024	298								117185	10.1016/j.oceaneng.2024.117185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2024.117185		FEB 2024											WOS:001211331900001

Due to the impractical processing times of exact solutions, heuristics have been harnessed to solve this problem. However, the scale of the networks, the set of candidate links and the metrics assessed have been limited. This research proposes a MO-DNDP that encapsulates 8 metrics across three real networks used as benchmarks scaling from 17 km2 to 41,850 km2 to encapsulate the complexity of optimising transport networks at different scales, traffic demands and constraint densities. To solve this more comprehensive MO-DNDP, this paper proposes the Physarum-inspired algorithm PANDA that improves upon the classical Physarum Solver algorithm by harnessing the attractant sensing and merging capabilities of the biological Physarum Polycephalum slime mould. PANDA is a first attempt at solving the complex MO-DNDP using the Physarum foraging model. PANDA consistently scored better than the classical Solver in the land use rating by circumventing landforms, built-up areas, and environmentally sensitive regions. Additionally, PANDA constructed networks that were on average 30 % better than the existing benchmark networks and 32 % better than the Physarum Solver networks. PANDA improved upon the benchmarks by constructing lower capacity roads that were optimised for the actual traffic demand between each origin-destination pair instead of shared arterials.																			0957-4174	1873-6793				JUL 15	2024	246								123195	10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123195		JAN 2024											WOS:001164837800001

While previous studies have informed us of the importance of networks for innovation, we know little of how companies intentionally can design and utilize networks to achieve continuous innovation. The aim of this paper is to explore how a network for continuous innovation can be established and managed. A longitudinal case study has been performed using data covering the establishment and subsequent management of a network for supporting continuous innovation, spanning the product management and R&D department of a large multinational company. The results reveal the potential to use intra-organizational networks to invoke organizational pressure conducive for making innovation happen. This pressure is induced by autonomy and self-organizing in the network and consists of reciprocal expectations and demands between the top (management) and the bottom (employees involved in the network) of the organizational hierarchy. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

J	Liu, YR; Wang, ZD; Liu, XH				Liu, Yurong; Wang, Zidong; Liu, Xiaohui			On synchronization of coupled neural networks with discrete and unbounded distributed delays	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS												In this paper, we deal with the synchronization problem for an array of linearly coupled neural networks with simultaneous presence of both the discrete and unbounded distributed time-delays. By utilizing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed synchronization problem is solvable if several linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. Hence, different from the commonly used matrix norm theories (such as the M-matrix method), a unified LMI approach is developed to establish sufficient conditions for the coupled neural networks to be globally synchronized, where the LMIs can be easily solved by using the Matlab LMI toolbox and no tuning of parameters is required. It is also shown that the synchronization of coupled neural networks with bounded distributed delays is just a special case of our main results. A numerical example is provided to show the usefulness of the proposed global synchronization condition.

The network model considers link capacities ranging over a discrete set of values, and both fixed and linear costs, which pose severe limitations to the possibility of finding global optimum solutions. An approximated version of the problem - which neglects the discrete nature of link capacities - is here formulated as a multicommodity flow problem with linear cost function and fixed costs on a hypergraph. Such a problem is NP-hard. A greedy algorithm, which extends the one proposed by Minoux, is devised. A more general solution approach is also developed, which consists of a decomposition of the general problem into two major steps. Aim of the first is to design a partial network which satisfies a given percentage of the overall demand. This task is formulated as a pure combinatorial problem, in terms of 0-1 linear programming. The second step consists of finding a completion of the partial network, and can be formulated as a classical multicommodity graph-flow problem with fixed costs. Prior to both approaches, effective cluster analysis techniques are suggested for reducing the input size, according to demand, and/or to geographical, logical, and economic criteria.

By combining the user bases into the same network, and ensuring that all traffic is mixed together, we hope to lower delay and improve anonymity for both sets of users. Alpha-mixing is an approach that can be added to traditional batching strategies to let senders specify for each message whether they prefer security or speed. Here we describe how to add alpha-mixing to various mix designs, and show that mix networks with this feature can provide increased anonymity for all senders in the network. Along the way we encounter subtle issues to do with the attacker's knowledge of the security parameters of the users.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-540-68790-0				2006	4258						245	257																WOS:000244711400014

With the availability of unprecedented data sets, simulating large-scale social networks of millions, or even billions, of entities has become a new challenge. Current simulation environments for social studies are mostly sequential and may not be efficient when social networks grow to a certain size. In order to facilitate large-scale social network modeling and simulation, this paper proposes a framework named SUPE-Net, which is based on a parallel discrete event simulation environment YH-SUPE for massively parallel architectures. The framework is designed as a layered architecture with utilities for network generation, algorithms and agent-based modeling. Distributed adjacency lists are used for graph modeling and a reaction-diffusion paradigm is adapted to model dynamical processes. Experiments are performed using PageRank and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on social networks with millions of entities. The results demonstrate that SUPE-Net has achieved a speedup of 12, and increased the event-processing rate by 11%, with good scalability and effectiveness.																			0037-5497	1741-3133				OCT	2013	89	10			SI		1173	1183		10.1177/0037549713495752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0037549713495752													WOS:000330222500003

The FHE material comprises a highly stretchable patterned circuit with dry flexible electrodes. The pre-stretched circuit was obtained by mixing three-dimensional (3D) dendritic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with two-dimensional (2D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in a thermoplastic elastomer and patterning the resultant as wires using steel plate stencil printing. Based on the nano-dispersion principle, the geometrical differences of nanomaterials could be exploited to form a 3D continuous phase conductive network with improved tensile properties. A highly stretchable and bendable conductive film with a resistance of 1.4 x 10(-2) ohm/sq was obtained by mixing 80 wt % of 3D dendritic AgNPs and 1 wt% of rGO to produce pre-strained nanowires with a horseshoe pattern. Furthermore, the conductive film could be coated with a polyurethane (PU) layer to achieve good stability in the washing test. In the tensile fatigue test, the resistance variation Delta R of horseshoe patterned nanowire was only 1.9 ohm under 500 stretches. Additionally, a low-resistance film (similar to 10(3) ohm.cm) was fabricated by adding 7 wt% of carbon black and 2D graphene nanoplatelets (CB/GNPs, 4:1) and styrene maleic anhydride-amide (SMA-amide, 10:1 ratio with carbon material), yielding superior fatigue resistance. Finally, a design combining the prestretched circuit pattern with dry sensing flexible conductive electrodes was developed and successfully applied for EMG and ECG of smart clothes.

As a solution to all problems, we advocate the use of both electrical basis functions (orthogonal prolate spheroidal basis functions) and optical basis functions, implemented as FBGs with orthogonal impulse response in addition to spatial modes. We design the Bragg gratings with orthogonal impulse responses by means of discrete layer peeling algorithm. The target impulse responses belong to the class of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, which are mutually orthogonal regardless of the sequence order, while occupying the fixed bandwidth.

In other words, the producers are faced with the satisfaction of heterogeneous customer needs through individualization and the realization of scale effects along the value chain. This study is among the first that proposes a mixed-integer programming model to obtain the optimal configuration of a supply network comprising of a pool of suppliers to satisfy the demand of highly-customized and modular-structured products. The product individualization is incorporated into the model by considering different design complexity levels for the components/sub-assemblies in the bill-of-material. Furthermore, the impact of batch size is modeled by considering piece-wise production cost functions in different echelons of the network. Our numerical results inspired by the case of tunable lasers indicate that the configuration of supply network varies as a function of the demand at different design complexity levels. Whereas, the profitability of supply network is closely tied to the market condition as well as the production capacity, flexibility of processes, and cost structure of manufacturers.

Piecewise continuous hybrid systems based observer design for linear systems with variable sampling periods and delay output	SIGNAL PROCESSING												The present paper deals with a new continuous undelayed state observer design approach by using only the sampled and delayed measurements where the sampling period and delayed value are variable and unknown. This proposed piecewise continuous observer (PCO), which is derived by using the theory of a particular hybrid systems called piecewise continuous hybrid systems (PCHS), has a very simple structure and can be easily implemented to the networked visual serving systems. This type PCO observer can be also adapted easily according to other kind feedbacks, such as sampled output, delayed output, sampled and delayed state, sampled state, or delayed state whose sampling periods and delayed values are unknown. The proposed PCO observer stability is also analyzed and demonstrated. Moreover, to show the proposed PCO observer performance, a comparison with a Lyapunov-Krasovskii technique and descriptor representation based observer is conducted via a numerical example.

Through system transformation, the optimal tracking problem is converted into designing a finite-horizon optimal regulator for the tracking error dynamics. Then, with convergence analysis in terms of cost function and control law, the iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm via heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) technique is introduced to obtain the finite-horizon optimal tracking controller which makes the cost function close to its optimal value within an epsilon-error bound. Three neural networks are used as parametric structures to implement the algorithm, which aims at approximating the cost function, the control law, and the error dynamics, respectively.

Firstly, an event-triggering control scheme is proposed via continuous sampling. In addition, there exists a consistent positive lower bound for the time interval between two successive trigger events, which implies that the Zeno phenomenon will not occur. Next, by designing an appropriate sampling period, a more practical event-triggering scheme is proposed with periodic sampling, which can ensure the projective synchronization of the drive-response neural networks systems.

Advancing the science of spatial neglect rehabilitation: an improved statistical approach with mixed linear modeling	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE												Valid research on neglect rehabilitation demands a statistical approach commensurate with the characteristics of neglect rehabilitation data: neglect arises from impairment in distinct brain networks leading to large between-subject variability in baseline symptoms and recovery trajectories. Studies enrolling medically ill, disabled patients, may suffer from missing, unbalanced data, and small sample sizes. Finally, assessment of rehabilitation requires a description of continuous recovery trajectories. Unfortunately, the statistical method currently employed in most studies of neglect treatment [repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), rANOVA] does not well-address these issues. Here we review an alternative, mixed linear modeling (MLM), that is more appropriate for assessing change over time. MLM better accounts for between-subject heterogeneity in baseline neglect severity and in recovery trajectory. MLM does not require complete or balanced data, nor does it make strict assumptions regarding the data structure. Furthermore, because MLM better models between-subject heterogeneity it often results in increased power to observe treatment effects with smaller samples. After reviewing current practices in the field, and the assumptions of rANOVA, we provide an introduction to MLM. We review its assumptions, uses, advantages, and disadvantages. Using real and simulated data, we illustrate how MLM may improve the ability to detect effects of treatment over ANOVA, particularly with the small samples typical of neglect research. Furthermore, our simulation analyses result in recommendations for the design of future rehabilitation studies. Because between-subject heterogeneity is one important reason why studies of neglect treatments often yield conflicting results, employing statistical procedures that model this heterogeneity more accurately will increase the efficiency of our efforts to find treatments to improve the lives of individuals with neglect.

However, during the last decade an interest to find alternate design strategies has raised for several reasons. In general, the traffic density cannot be assumed constant throughout, making necessary the relocation of base stations inside the traffic hot spots. If traffic is characterized in a discrete manner, the optimal base stations location problem can be treated as a well-known problem in signal processing called vector quantization. We found that applying such a design strategy, better frequency assignments for a network can be accomplished.																					0-7803-7779-6				2003							653	656		10.1109/ICSMC2.2003.1428343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC2.2003.1428343													WOS:000228094500167

For the bill of materials, product, sub-assembly and component substitution possibilities are considered. For the supply chain network, facility and distribution center location are considered as well as the choice of suppliers. A Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) model is proposed. The MILP formulation is solved optimally for medium-sized instances. For larger instances, two heuristics derived from the MILP are designed. These methods are computationally tested on various instances from a generator conceived for this purpose. The modelling of product substitution possibilities through product transformation permits the solving of large size instances that are now adequate for real problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jiang, N				Jiang, Nan			Optimal Signal Design for Mixed Equilibrium Networks with Autonomous and Regular Vehicles	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION												A signal design problem is studied for efficiently managing autonomous vehicles (AVs) and regular vehicles (RVs) simultaneously in transportation networks. AVs and RVs move on separate lanes and two types of vehicles share the green times at the same intersections. The signal design problem is formulated as a bilevel program. The lower-level model describes a mixed equilibrium where autonomous vehicles follow the Cournot-Nash (CN) principle and RVs follow the user equilibrium (UE) principle. In the upper-level model, signal timings are optimized at signalized intersections to allocate appropriate green times to both autonomous and RVs to minimize system travel cost. The sensitivity analysis based method is used to solve the bilevel optimization model. Various signal control strategies are evaluated through numerical examples and some insightful findings are obtained. It was found that the number of phases at intersections should be reduced for the optimal control of the AVs and RVs in the mixed networks. More importantly, incorporating AVs into the transportation network would improve the system performance due to the value of AV technologies in reducing random delays at intersections. Meanwhile, travelers prefer to choose AVs when the networks turn to be congested.																			0197-6729	2042-3195					2017									UNSP 5649823	10.1155/2017/5649823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/5649823													WOS:000408485000001

The network has real time users (RTUs) that must attain a specific set of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs), and non-RTUs whose SINRs should be balanced and maximised.

In the case of infeasibility, they have proposed a fallback mechanism which converts the problem to a pure max-min optimisation.

This paper proposes a learning approach that relies on neural networks to compute the state transformation map involved in the design of Kazantzis-Kravaris-Luenberger (KKL) based observers. Based on this transformation, we propose a chain of observers in cascade with exponential stability guarantees through the inverse transformation mapping in the original coordinates. Finally, we provide a simulation example that includes a sensitivity analysis of the delay parameter to illustrate the performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning-based design of chain observers for discrete-time nonlinear systems with output measurement delay.

This discrete wavelet transform radial basis neural network (DWT-RBNN) analyzes vibration induced by human motions, and identifies motion status automatically. The 3-D vibration signals are measured by integrated accelerometer chip, and then DWT extracts vibration features. Local energy of extracted feature is calculated and used by RBNN. A multi-channel RBNN is designed and used for recognition. The computation burden is reduced because of the DWT pre-processing. From experiment results, RBNN shows successful recognition capability.

On synchronization errors in networked feedback systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS												This paper addresses the problem of synchronization errors and their effects on feedback loops that are closed over communication networks. It is assumed that the feedback loop consists of two discrete-time systems, the clock frequency ratio of which has a special rational form, and is close to one. A Toeplitz; matrix approach is taken to model the input/output relationship of the arising feedback systems. Based on this representation, the effect of synchronization errors on stability of the feedback systems is analyzed. It is shown that stability of the synchronized feedback loop can not guarantee stability of the loop in the presence of synchronization errors. Necessary and sufficient stability conditions are derived.																			1549-8328	1558-0806				OCT	2006	53	10					2306	2317		10.1109/TCSI.2006.882824	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2006.882824													WOS:000241391700021

Automated Design Framework for Synthetic Biology Exploiting Pareto Optimality	ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY												In this work we consider Pareto optimality for automated design in synthetic biology. We present a generalized framework based on a mixed-integer dynamic optimization formulation that, given design specifications, allows the computation of Pareto optimal sets of designs, that is, the set of best trade-offs for the metrics of interest. We show how this framework can be used for (i) forward design, that is, finding the Pareto optimal set of synthetic designs for implementation, and (ii) reverse design, that is, analyzing and inferring motifs and/or design principles of gene regulatory networks from the Pareto set of optimal circuits. Finally, we illustrate the capabilities and performance of this framework considering four case studies. In the first problem we consider the forward design of an oscillator. In the remaining problems, we illustrate how to apply the reverse design approach to find motifs for stripe formation, rapid adaption, and fold-change detection, respectively.

This type of controller has its simplicity in parallelism to conventional generalized predictive control design and efficiency to deal with complex nonlinear dynamics. A mathematical model using RWNN is constructed, and a learning algorithm adopting a recursive least squares is employed to identify the unknown parameters in the consequent part of the RWNN. The proposed control law is derived based on the minimization of a modified predictive performance criterion. Two theorems are presented for the conditions of the stability analysis and steady-state performance of the closed-loop systems. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed control gives satisfactory tracking and disturbance rejection performances. Experimental results for position control of a positioning mechanism show the efficacy of the proposed method with setpoint changes.																			0278-0046	1557-9948				SEP	2009	56	9					3733	3742		10.1109/TIE.2009.2025714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2025714													WOS:000268896000050

The growth of 1D ZnCo2O4 nanowires on the surface of 3D NF was done by a hydrothermal process, followed by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) of 2D NiO nanosheets. The obtained results indicated that the NiO content in the as-prepared NF/ZnCo2O4 @NiO network heterostructures could be promoted by increasing the CBD time, which improved their specific surface areas. Owing to utilizing the multiple interfaces for enhancing the interfacial polarization, the as-prepared NF/ZnCo2O4 @NiO network heterostructures presented the remarkably enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption performances (EMWAPs) compared to NF/ZnCo2O4 nanowire arrays. Moreover, the EMWAPs of mixed-dimensional NF/ZnCo2O4 @NiO network heterostructures could be further optimized by increasing the NiO content, which was demonstrated to promote the interfacial polarization. Generally, the findings demonstrated that taking full advantage of interface engineering in constructing the mixed-dimensional conductive network heterostructures is a very effective strategy to aggrandize dielectric loss, which provided an efficient and promising strategy to develop the novel and high-efficient microwave absorbers.

The quasi-continuous high-order sliding mode controller is designed to track the responses of the normal system to guarantee the velocity and altitude track the reference trajectories rapidly. An improved measure by increasing the relative degree of the quasi-continuous high-order sliding mode is introduced to eliminate the effects on outputs caused by chattering and parametric uncertainties. In view of actuator coupling, an equivalent canonical model is formulated through feedback linearization to accelerate the faults estimation for the actuator faults system. A neural network observer is then utilized to online estimate the unknown faults. This observer can be applied to highly nonlinear system without any prior knowledge of system dynamics as it uses a nonlinear-in-parameters neural network. Meanwhile, the stability and convergence of the faults system is proved theoretically. Simulation results are presented to testify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme.

In this direction, battery-powered electric bus systems have been considered widely for ensuring flexibility, operation cost, and lesser pollutants emission. Industry 4.0 provides automation through a cyber-physical system (CPS), the interconnection of bus system entities with industrial internet-of-things (IIoT), remote information availability through cloud computing and scientific disciplines (human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc.) integration. In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city & x2019;s passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger & x2019;s capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger & x2019;s waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions. In similar traffic conditions, total passenger & x2019;s time in system (ticket booking to travel) varies between 41.6 minutes (for 24 hours) to 45.5 minutes (for 1 year). In the simulation, priorities are given to those dependent and independent variables which save the battery consumption and elongate the utilization of buses. Lastly, it is also observed that the proposed system is suitable for resource-constraint devices because Gate Equivalent (GE) calculation shows that the proposed system can be implemented between 1986 GEs (communicational cost without confidentiality and authentication) and 7939 GEs (computational cost with HMAC for authentication in data storage). This ensures varies security primitivs such as confidentiality, availability and authentication.

J	Takahashi, K; Miwa, T				Takahashi, Kazunori; Miwa, Takashi			A Local Oscillator Phase Compensation Technique for Ultra-Wideband Stepped-Frequency Continuous Wave Radar Based on a Low-Cost Software-Defined Radio	SENSORS												The paper discusses a way to configure a stepped-frequency continuous wave (SFCW) radar using a low-cost software-defined radio (SDR). The most of high-end SDRs offer multiple transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) channels, one of which can be used as the reference channel for compensating the initial phases of TX and RX local oscillator (LO) signals. It is same as how commercial vector network analyzers (VNAs) compensate for the LO initial phase. These SDRs can thus acquire phase-coherent in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) data without additional components and an SFCW radar can be easily configured. On the other hand, low-cost SDRs typically have only one transmitter and receiver. Therefore, the LO initial phase has to be compensated and the phases of the received I/Q signals have to be retrieved, preferably without employing an additional receiver and components to retain the system low-cost and simple. The present paper illustrates that the difference between the phases of TX and RX LO signals varies when the LO frequency is changed because of the timing of the commencement of the mixing. The paper then proposes a technique to compensate for the LO initial phases using the internal RF loopback of the transceiver chip and to reconstruct a pulse, which requires two streaming: one for the device under test (DUT) channel and the other for the internal RF loopback channel. The effect of the LO initial phase and the proposed method for the compensation are demonstrated by experiments at a single frequency and sweeping frequency, respectively. The results show that the proposed method can compensate for the LO initial phases and ultra-wideband (UWB) pulses can be reconstructed correctly from the data sampled by a low-cost SDR.

Given an undirected graph, the problem requires installing at most one facility on each edge such that a set of point-to-point commodity flows can be routed and costs are minimized. In the literature, the Lagrangian relaxation is usually applied to an arc-based formulation to derive lower bounds. In this work, we investigate a path-based formulation and we solve its Lagrangian relaxation using several non-differentiable optimization techniques. More precisely, we devised six variants of the deflected subgradient procedures, using various direction-search and step-length strategies. The computational performance of these Lagrangian-based approaches are evaluated and compared on a set of randomly generated instances, and real-world problems. The empirical results show that the Lagrangian relaxation of the path-based formulation requires less computation time than the arc-based formulation.

Recent years have witnessed increasing efforts in detecting anomalies with discrete event sequences. However, it remains an extremely difficult task due to several intrinsic challenges including data imbalance issues, discrete property of the events, and sequential nature of the data. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose OC4Seq, a multi-scale one-class recurrent neural network for detecting anomalies in discrete event sequences. Specifically, OC4Seq integrates the anomaly detection objective with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to embed the discrete event sequences into latent spaces, where anomalies can be easily detected. In addition, given that an anomalous sequence could be caused by either individual events, subsequences of events, or the whole sequence, we design a multi-scale RNN framework to capture different levels of sequential patterns simultaneously. We fully implement and evaluate OC4Seq on three real-world system log datasets. The results show that OC4Seq consistently outperforms various representative baselines by a large margin. Moreover, through both quantitative and qualitative analysis, the importance of capturing multi-scale sequential patterns for event anomaly detection is verified. To encourage reproducibility, we make the code and data publicly available(1).

In this paper, the main drawbacks of the current literatures related to networked control system are discussed. Meanwhile, a uniform model is developed based on the linear time-invariable plant model, including the situations in which the network-induced delays are shorter or longer than sampling periods. Considering the dynamic features of controller, noise and packets dropout, the uniform model is built in the discrete stochastic formation, and then many conveniences are presented for the controller design and stability analysis.

An all-solid-state asymmetric device based on a polyaniline hydrogel for a high energy flexible supercapacitor	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												The demand for low cost, flexible energy storage devices with enhanced energy/power density has increased with the rapid development of portable, flexible electronics. Herein, we report on an all-solid-state flexible, high energy density asymmetric supercapacitor (SC) based on a polyaniline (PANI) hydrogel made using a two-component mixing strategy. PANI hydrogel consists of polymeric networks with high levels of hydration and three-dimensional (3D) microstructures, which lead to faster electron and mass transport and offer a large accessible surface area. The 3D design is mechanically robust and flexible with large internal surfaces designed to pull water via capillary action. The design features ensure a strong interaction between the electrode and electrolyte solution for effective charge storage reactions, while at the same time giving the electrode sufficient mechanical flexibility to work under a bent condition. The PANI hydrogel electrode exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 862 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). Utilizing this nanocomposite as the positive electrode in a PANI//AC asymmetric configuration results in devices with a remarkable performance including good capacitance (261 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), great rate capability (64% capacitance retention), excellent cycle life (18% loss after 5000 cycles), a maximum energy density of 92.7 W h kg(-1), and a high power density of 16 kW kg(-1). Furthermore, the areal capacitance, areal energy density, volumetric capacitance, and volumetric energy density of the fabricated supercapacitor are 522 mF cm(-2), 0.185 mW h cm(-2), 17.4 F cm(-3), and 6.16 mW h cm(-3), respectively. Even under continuous bending and unbending, the device still provides a stable electrochemical performance without noticeable changes. We also demonstrate the promise of these SCs for various applications as we light up a green LED. This excellent performance holds great promise for next-generation flexible electronics.

This self-supporting strategy allowed for simple and efficient catalyst immobilization without the use of extra added support, giving well-characterized, insoluble (in toluene) polymeric materials (4). The resulting self-supported catalysts (4) showed outstanding catalytic performance for the asymmetric hydrogenation of a number of alpha-dehydroamino acids (5) and 2-aryl enamides (7) with enantiomeric excess (ee) ranges of 94-98% and 90-98%, respectively. The linker moiety in 4 influenced the reactivity significantly, albeit with slight impact on the enantioselectivity. Acquisition of reaction profiles under steady-state conditions showed 4h and 4i to have the highest reactivity (turnover frequency (TOF) = 95 and 97 h(-1) at 2 atm, respectively), whereas appropriate substrate/catalyst matching was needed for optimum chiral induction. The former was recycled 10 times without loss in ee (95-96%), although a drop in TOF of approximately 20% per cycle was observed. The estimation of effective catalytic sites in self-supported catalyst 4e was also carried out by isolation and hydrogenation of catalyst-substrate complex, showing about 37% of the Rh-1 centers in the self-supported catalyst 4e are accessible to substrate 5c in the catalysis. A continuous flow reaction system using an activated C/4h mixture as stationary-phase catalyst for the asymmetric hydrogenation of 5b was developed and run continuously for a total of 144 h with >99% conversion and 96-97% enantioselectivity. The total Rh leaching in the product solution is 1.7% of that in original catalyst 4h.					shi, lei/N-9415-2014; Wang, Z./A-9077-2013	shi, lei/0000-0002-2644-1168; Ding, Kuiling/0000-0003-4074-1981													0947-6539	1521-3765					2009	15	38					9855	9867		10.1002/chem.200900899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.200900899								19685536					WOS:000270435600029

More specifically, an sampled-data (SD) control technique is introduced to reduce the burden of the limited bandwidth of the network, a general consecutive packet loss model is used to represent the stochastic packet loss behavior between sensor to-controller and controller-to-actuator, and an observer scheme based on received SD output information is used to obtain the estimated system states. Based on the above scenarios, an exact discrete-time model approach is developed for stabilizing networked T-S fuzzy systems. First, the considered system with the observer-based control scheme is transformed into its discrete-time model such that subsequent analysis will be carried out in the discrete-time domain. On this basis, stability criteria are derived by fully considering the probability distribution of consecutive packet losses. Furthermore, an observer-based controller is designed by introducing some auxiliary matrices. Finally, the correctness and practicability of the designed controller is demonstrated by a mass-spring-damper system.

Large scale hydrologic and tracer aided modelling: A review	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Stable isotopes in water (oxygen-18 and deuterium) are hydrologic tracers, which have been embedded into both analytical mass balance and physically based continuous simulation models, improving hydrologic process partitioning and regional source identification, resulting in early climate change detection. Recent advances in the field of isotope hydrology have improved coordinated investment in global monitoring networks, invested in integrated modelling tools to support prediction and model evaluation, and expanded the scale of analyses possible. This review focuses on the applications of isotope tracers to large scale hydrologic modelling, its inception and evolution, and future directions for advancing this field with emphasis on the utility of isotope tracers for operational water resources prediction. The hydrologic community has begun to steer toward alter-native hydrologic data due to the coinciding realities of limited data records and urgent data needs. Water re-sources infrastructure and management requires projections of water supply beyond the 50-to 100-year design life, with the general rule of flow frequency necessitating a 100-to 200-year assessment, however, there exist few data networks globally with records sufficient to support this kind of long-term assessment, and climate change is increasing the frequency of these extreme events. Historically, large-scale, and long time series simulation has meant less attention on process function (model fidelity) due to computational constraints, however, we argue that this may no longer be adequate under increasingly complex climate-hydrologic feedbacks, and integrated system models that incorporate human decisions, environmental health and socio-economic pressures. To expand the uptake of isotope tracers in practice, we emphasize their value for extreme quantile prediction under future projections and call for the community of practice to support data networks and accessibility, support peer re-view of large-domain (less data intensive) applications, and employ the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) scientific principles. Though still an emerging scientific field, isotope hydrology has considerable value to the practitioner community with the proper education and training necessary to build confidence, under-pinned by well developed and accessible tools for deployment.

Then the adjustments must be made for a proper proportioning. This kind of concrete mix design and adjustments are somewhat complicated, time-consuming, and uncertain tasks. In this paper, as a tool to minimize the uncertainties and errors, the neural network is applied to the proportioning of concrete mixtures. Not only the numerical required compressive strengths but also the actual compressive strengths with variations obtained from the final compressive strength test is used to train and test the networks. The results show that neural networks have a strong potential as a tool for concrete mix design.																					89-950042-0-7				1997							1507	1512																WOS:000166751500237

However, most designed surfaces do not hold this nice property because it is hard to enforce such constraints in the design process. In this paper, we present a novel method for surface fairing which takes a regular distribution of the principal curvature line network on a surface as an objective. Our method first removes the high-frequency signals from the curvature tensor field of an input freeform surface by a novel rolling guidance tensor filter, which results in a more regular and smooth curvature tensor field, then deforms the input surface to match the smoothed field as much as possible. As an application, we solve the problem of approximating freeform surfaces with regular principal curvature line networks, discretized by quadrilateral meshes. By introducing the circular or conical conditions on the quadrilateral mesh to guarantee the existence of discrete principal curvature line networks, and minimizing the approximate error to the original surface and improving the fairness of the quad mesh, we obtain a regular discrete principal curvature line network that approximates the original surface. We evaluate the efficacy of our method on various freeform surfaces and demonstrate the superiority of the rolling guidance tensor filter over other tensor smoothing techniques. We also utilize our method to generate high-quality circular/conical meshes for architecture design and cyclide spline surfaces for CAD modeling.

Specifically, a hybrid PA mode, transferring between continuous inverse Class-F and continuous Class-F, is for the first time employed to design PAs with optimal performance over more than-an-octave bandwidth. A GaN PA is designed and realized based on this mode-transferring operation using a three-stage transmission-line-based low-pass matching network. Simulation and experimental results show that an in-band PA-mode transferring between continuous Class-F-1 and continuous Class-F is successfully performed. The implemented PA achieves a measured 87% bandwidth from 1.3 to 3.3 GHz, while exhibiting a state-of-the-art performance of >10-dB gain, 60%-84% efficiency, and 10-W output power throughout this band. Furthermore, modulated evaluation is carried out using a 300-kHz bandwidth 16-quadrature amplitude-modulation signal.

Enteral sedative administration is nowadays unusual, even though the gastrointestinal tract works soon after ICU admission. The enteral approach cannot produce deep sedation; however, it is as adequate as the intravenous one, if the target is to keep patients awake and adapted to the environment, and has fewer side effects and lower costs. Methods/Design: A randomized, controlled, multicenter, single-blind trial comparing enteral and intravenous sedative treatments has been done in 12 Italian ICUs. The main objective was to achieve and maintain the desired sedation level: observed RASS = target RASS +/- 1. Three hundred high-risk patients were planned to be randomly assigned to receive either intravenous propofol/midazolam or enteral melatonin/hydroxyzine/lorazepam. Group assignment occurred through online minimization process, in order to balance variables potentially influencing the outcomes (age, sex, SAPS II, type of admission, kidney failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sepsis) between groups. Once per shift, the staff recorded neurological monitoring using validated tools. Three flowcharts for pain, sedation, and delirium have been proposed; they have been designed to treat potentially correctable factors first, and, only once excluded, to administer neuroactive drugs. The study lasted from January 24 to December 31, 2012. A total of 348 patients have been randomized, through a centralized website, using a specific software expressly designed for this study. The created network of ICUs included a mix of both university and non-university hospitals, with different experience in managing enteral sedation. A dedicated free-access website was also created, in both Italian and English, for continuous education of ICU staff through CME courses. Discussion: This 'educational research' project aims both to compare two sedative strategies and to highlight the need for a profound cultural change, improving outcomes by keeping critically-ill patients awake.

Measuring the Mixing Time of a Network	2015 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS (INFOCOM)	IEEE INFOCOM				34th IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)	APR 26-MAY 01, 2015	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				Mixing time is a global property of a network that indicates how fast a random walk gains independence from its starting point. Mixing time is an essential parameter for many distributed algorithms, but especially those based on gossip. We design, implement, and evaluate a distributed protocol to measure mixing time. The protocol extends an existing algorithm that models the diffusion of information seen from each node in the network as the impulse response of a particular dynamic system. In its original formulation, the algorithm was susceptible to topology changes (or "churn") and was evaluated only in simulation. Here we present a concrete implementation of an enhanced version of the algorithm that exploits multiple parallel runs to obtain a robust measurement, and evaluate it using a network testbed (Emulab) in combination with a peer-to-peer system (FreePastry) to assess both its performance and its ability to deal with network churn.																			0743-166X		978-1-4799-8381-0				2015																								WOS:000370720100307

A network-induced delay stochastic model is first constructed by event-triggered approach. Utilizing stochastic analysis and event-triggered schemes, conditions on stochastic finite-time (FT) boundedness and stochastic H-infinity FT boundedness are then derived for the network model. Subsequently, an event-based finite-time controller and an event-triggered matrix are co-designed to ensure that the stochastic model is stochastically FT bounded or stochastically H-infinity FT bounded by utilizing matrix decomposition scheme.

The design problem consists in finding the capacity on each link and the routing metrics that ensure the successful rerouting of the soft-LSPs for all failure scenarios of interest to the network planner. The objective is to minimize the cost of the network overlay. A mixed non-linear mathematical programming model is proposed for the problem. In order to obtain "good" solutions for real-size instances of the problem, we propose a tabu search algorithm.

The focuses of this paper are to study admissibility properties and the termination criteria of discrete-time local value iteration ADP algorithms. In the discrete-time local value iteration ADP algorithm, the iterative value functions and the iterative control laws are both updated in a given subset of the state space in each iteration, instead of the whole state space. For the first time, admissibility properties of iterative control laws are analyzed for the local value iteration ADP algorithm. New termination criteria are established, which terminate the iterative local ADP algorithm with an admissible approximate optimal control law.

J	Gu, Y; Yang, GH				Gu, Ying; Yang, Guang-Hong			Event-triggered fault detection for discrete-time Lipschitz nonlinear networked systems in finite-frequency domain	NEUROCOMPUTING												The problem of event-triggered fault detection (FD) filter design for discrete-time Lipschitz nonlinear networked systems with finite-frequency specifications is investigated. The event-triggered transmission scheme is introduced to mitigate the utility of limited network bandwidth. The developed filter combines the H-infinity and H- indices. For this class of systems, the generalized Kalman-Yakubovic-Popov lemma-based finite-frequency FD filter design methods are invalid. To solve this problem, the nonlinear error dynamics are transformed into a linear parameter varying (LPV) system based on the use of a reformulated Lipschitz property and a new lemma is developed to capture the system performances in finite-frequency domain. By introducing slack variable techniques, sufficient conditions for the design of FD filter are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The proposed design method can significantly reduce the data transmission and achieve a better FD performance than that in full frequency domain. Finally, two examples are presented to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the new results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A MILP formulation of ReLU networks has recently been applied by many authors to probe for various model properties subject to input bounds. The formulation is obtained by programming each ReLU operator with a binary variable and applying the big-M method. The efficiency of the formulation hinges on the tightness of the bounds defined by the big-M values. When ReLU networks are embedded in a larger optimization problem, the presence of output bounds can be exploited in bound tightening. To this end, we devise and study several bound tightening procedures that consider both input and output bounds. Our numerical results show that bound tightening may reduce solution times considerably, and that small-sized ReLU networks are suitable as surrogate models in mixed-integer linear programs.

Mixed <i>K</i> -Dissipativity and Stabilization to ISS for Impulsive Hybrid Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS												This brief studies the issue of dissipativity and related stabilization to input-to-state stability (ISS) for impulsive hybrid systems (IHSs). First, the concept of mixed K -dissipativity is proposed. Then, the criteria of stabilization to ISS are derived for an IHS with mixed K -dissipativity. It shows that, under the same state feedback control, although all subsystems have a nonnegative supply rate and thus have no ISS, the whole IHSmay still have ISS. The results are then used to study the case of a network via impulsive interconnections. The linear matrix inequality conditions for the mixed K -dissipativity of every node in the network under the quadratic supply rate are derived. Moreover, the interconnection control is designed to stabilize the network to ISS. Finally, one example is given for illustration.

And the vertex separator method is employed to give LMI(linear matrix inequality)-based controller design conditions. By using the designed controller, a dynamic quantization control strategy is proposed with updating the quantizer's parameter such that the system is asymptotically stable and the performance index is with a upper bound. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the control strategy.																			2161-2927						2014							5824	5829																WOS:000366482805169

Network quantization is a promising way of alleviating this problem. However, network quantization can result in accuracy degradation and this is especially the case with the compact CNN architectures that are designed for mobile applications. This paper presents a novel and efficient mixed-precision quantization pipeline, called MBFQuant. It redefines the design space for mixed-precision quantization by keeping the bitwidth of the multiplier fixed, unlike other existing methods, because we have found that the quantized model can maintain almost the same running efficiency, so long as the sum of the quantization bitwidth of the weight and the input activation of a layer is a constant. To maximize the accuracy of a quantized CNN model, we have developed a Simulated Annealing (SA)-based optimizer that can automatically explore the design space, and rapidly find the optimal bitwidth assignment. Comprehensive evaluations applying ten CNN architectures to four datasets have served to demonstrate that MBFQuant can achieve improvements in accuracy of up to 19.34% for image classification and 1.12% for object detection, with respect to a corresponding uniform bitwidth quantized model.

An efficient resource allocation to each traffic source is an extremely complex task. Network must be managed in real-time in order to avoid congestion. Network congestion requires admission control that in turn requires traffic measurements. In this paper we propose two methods, one for the link capacity allocation, an the other for the estimation of a cell loss rate in an ATM switch that is based on the convolution of probability density functions of rate signals at the switch's input. Both methods are simple and can be easily implemented in a DSP in an ATM node. They also point to a possible application of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to link capacity allocation and buffer design in high-speed networks.																					1-56555-204-0				2000							556	560																WOS:000088745300097

To reach this goal, a bi-objective mixed-integer linear model is proposed to make decisions at tactical and strategic levels. Notably, to deal with mixed uncertainty, a hybrid uncertain programming approach including adjustable possibilistic programming, chance-constrained programming, scenario-based programming, and p-robust optimization is developed and applied. Finally, the proposed model is implemented in a real-life case from the National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company to illustrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach. The analysis of the results indicates that the benefit of the used methods leads to the improvement of network performance against operational and disruption risks.

However, recently, evolutionary algorithms have been preferred due to their ability to solve complex, nonlinear, and discrete optimization problems such as water distribution system design. This study proposes a hybrid model, HHG that integrates Grey Wolf Optimizer and Harris Hawk, which is linked with an EPANET hydraulic simulator to optimize the design cost of a water distribution system network. The HHG model's performance is shown through three typical water distribution systems, namely the Two-loop network, Hanoi network and New York network. The results show that the HHG is a potential approach for solving water distribution system design costs with higher reliability, lower cost, and faster processing time than other conventional approaches.																			1562-3599	2331-2327				DEC 10	2023	23	16					2830	2840		10.1080/15623599.2022.2101593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15623599.2022.2101593		JUL 2022											WOS:000828599400001

Moreover, applying a reliable facility location problem is one of the most effective ways to protect against occasional failures of the system, because of considering unexpected failures and possible customer reassignment when locating facilities.

The research extends the influence of input harmonics on class-F power amplifiers to a more general form. Through waveform engineering, the impact of feedback is analyzed. By analyzing the change in cutoff angle caused by input nonlinearity, the change of the drain voltage and current waveforms of the hybrid continuous class-F power amplifier can be obtained. The new drain voltage and current waveforms obtained from the analysis redefine the design space of source impedance and load impedance for the hybrid continuous class-F power amplifier. By designing the corresponding input and output matching network, the second harmonic is suppressed, and finally, the hybrid continuous class-F power amplifier achieves a high-efficiency state. The research reveals that input harmonics also play an essential role in the design process of power amplifiers. A comparative experiment is designed to verify the theory. Simultaneously, a 1.6-2.8 GHz broadband hybrid continuous class-F power amplifier is designed using this theory, with a saturation efficiency of more than 61.2% and a saturation power of more than 40.4 dBm.

The main objective of this paper is to formulate an memory filter that can guarantee the resulting filtering error system to be finite-time bounded. Further, by considering the communication limitations, the state signals are quantised before transmission through a logarithmic quantiser and the quantisation error is considered in the filter design. In particular, the quantisation effects are dealt by employing the generalised sector bound approach. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, novel sufficient constraints are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities, to ensure the finite-time boundedness of the augmented filtering error system. Then, a new fault-tolerant memory filter is formulated and also the filter gain parameters are attained by solving the derived LMI based constraints.

The methods able to identify MIMO nonlinear systems are scarce. Harsh control signals produced by MVC are among other disadvantages of this controller. Besides, MVC is not a robust controller. In this article, the Vector ARX (VARX) model is used for simultaneously modeling the system and disturbance in order to tackle these disadvantages. For ensuring the robustness of the control loop, the discrete slide mode controller design approach is used in designing MVC and generalized MVC (GMVC). The proposed method for controller design is tested on a nonlinear experimental Four-Tank benchmark process and is compared with nonlinear MVCs designed by neural networks. In spite of the simplicity of designing GMVCs for the VARX models with uncertainty, the results show that the proposed method is accurate and implementable. (C) 2012 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Wind speed forecasting plays a fundamental role in overcoming such challenging issues and, thus, assisting the power utility manager in optimizing the supply-demand balancing through wind energy generation. This paper suggests a new hybrid scheme WNN, based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) combined with artificial neural network (ANN), for wind speed forecasting. More specifically, this work aims at designing the most appropriate discrete wavelet filters, best adapted to a one day ahead wind speed forecasting. The optimized DWT filters are intended to effectively preprocess the wind speed time series data in order to enhance the prediction accuracy. Using wind speed data collected from three different locations in the Magherbian region, the obtained simulation results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other conventional wavelet-based forecasting structures regarding the wind speed prediction precision. Moreover, compared to the standard wavelet 'db4' based approach, the optimized wavelet filter-based structure leads to a forecasting accuracy improvement, in terms of RMSE and MAPE index errors, that amounts to nearly 13% and 19%, respectively.

Regional consensus in discrete-time multi-agent systems subject to time-varying delays and saturating actuators	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL												This paper deals with consensus in discrete-time multi-agent systems under directed networks subject to time-varying delays and input saturation. Because saturation might prevent multi-agent systems from attaining consensus, system analysis and controller design require the characterization of the allowed region for the initial conditions. The main contributions of this work are sufficient conditions for consensus analysis and design of distributed protocols for discrete-time systems. Moreover, the conditions lead to a procedure allowing an estimate of the region of attraction. Such a procedure considers the effect of current and delayed states separately, yielding broader estimates of the allowed region for initial conditions. The results follow from the transformation of the consensus problem into a stability problem, with the subsequent employment of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory. The conditions are formulated as convex optimization problems. Finally, the paper presents examples and comparisons with previous approaches to illustrate the validity of the proposed methods.

J	Zhang, WL; Liu, JC				Zhang, Wenle; Liu, Jianchang			Ultra-fast consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems under a unified framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL												This paper deals with the ultra-fast consensus problem of high-order discrete-time multi-agent systems under a unified framework. A multi-step neighbour-error predictive mechanism is established based on the future evolution of the network dynamic without predictive information. By predicting the dynamics of a network several steps ahead and adding this information into the consensus protocol, a novel ultra-fast consensus protocol with the self-feedback term is proposed. The asymptotic convergence factor is improved by a power of q + 1 compared to the routine consensus protocol. The ultra-fast consensus algorithm can overcome the influence of communication topology to the convergence speed toward consensus, and solve the difficult problem of selecting the optimal control gain which minimises the asymptotic convergence factor. Moveover, some sufficient conditions for ultra-fast consensus design are given herein. The ones decouple the design of the synchronising gains from the detailed graph properties, and explicitly reveal how the agent dynamic and the communication graph jointly affect ultra-fast consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems. A simulation is performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.																			0020-7179	1366-5820				JUN 3	2015	88	6					1123	1132		10.1080/00207179.2014.994039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207179.2014.994039													WOS:000353385500003

We identify the underlying graph and generate cutting planes based on cuts in the detected network. Our implementation adds a separator to the branch-and-cut libraries of SCIP and CPLEX. We make use of the complemented mixed integer rounding framework but provide a special purpose aggregation heuristic that exploits the network structure. Our separation scheme speeds-up the computation for a large set of mixed integer programs coming from network design problems by a factor two on average. We show that almost 10% of the instances in general testsets contain consistent embedded networks. For these instances the computation time is decreased by 18% on average.																			1867-2949	1867-2957				JUN	2010	2	2					125	165		10.1007/s12532-010-0015-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12532-010-0015-3													WOS:000219315300003

The research on this problem has significant strategic value and has increasingly attracted attention, including in controlling the spread of diseases and dismantling terrorist organizations. In this paper, we focus on the problem of network disintegration with discrete entity resources from the attack view, that is, optimizing resource allocation to maximize the effect of network disintegration. Specifically, we model the network disintegration problem with limited entity resources as a nonlinear optimization problem and prove its NP-hardness. Then, we design a method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), Net-Cracker, which transforms the two-stage entity resource and network node selection task into a single-stage object selection problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with the benchmark algorithm, Net-Cracker can improve the solution quality by about 8 similar to 62%, while enabling a 30-to-160-fold speed up. Net-Cracker also exhibits strong generalization ability and can find better results in a near real-time manner even when the network scale is much larger than that in training data.

Distribution network design with big data: model and analysis	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH												This study addresses the problem of locating distribution centers in a single-echelon, capacitated distribution network. Such network consists of several potential distribution centers and various demand points dispersed in different regional markets. The distribution operations of this network generate massive amounts of data. The problem is how to utilize big data generated to identify the right number of distribution centers to open and the right assignment of customers to opened distribution centers while minimizing the total handling and operation costs of distribution centers, transportation, and penalty. Restrictions on both network capacity and single sourcing strategy are also considered. This study formulates this problem as mixed-integer nonlinear program. The effects of different scenarios on distribution-center locations as demand, the operation costs of distribution centers and outbound transportation, and the number of customers are analyzed through simulation on randomly generated big datasets. Empirical results indicate that the model presented is appropriate and robust. The operational value of big data in the distribution network design is revealed through a case study in which several design alternatives are evaluated.

By modulating the meandered centerline of a waveguide connecting two fixed points, new degrees of freedom (DoFs) to control the phase delay are obtained. RMWs represent a good compromise between coaxial cables, which feature broadband operation and can be easily bended still introducing high losses and conventional waveguides, which are characterized by low losses but also narrow operational bandwidth. RMWs are especially well-suited for isophase lattice expanders that can be used in beamforming networks (BFNs), phased arrays, or discrete 3-D lens antennas. The article describes a methodology to design meandered waveguides (MWs), which is verified both analytically and experimentally through the synthesis, fabrication, and test of a discrete 3-D lens antenna in the Ka-band (27.5-30 GHz) made using additive manufacturing (AM).					toso, giovanni/AAL-1704-2021; BERRETTI, LISA/KFB-7611-2024	BERRETTI, LISA/0000-0003-3193-2268; Polo-Lopez, Lucas/0000-0001-8289-7496; Toso, Giovanni/0000-0002-0301-5289													0018-926X	1558-2221				MAY	2023	71	5					4017	4027		10.1109/TAP.2023.3255515	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2023.3255515													WOS:000982572700025

However, most studies on carbon emissions have underestimated the complexity of the relationship of emissions with the concrete mix design and compressive strength. In this study, a database of mix designs was established by considering 1062 datasets related to the laboratory concrete mix designs and compressive strength values, and by using an artificial neural network model, a multiple nonlinear regression model, random forest model and support vector machines to simulate and predict the compressive strength of concrete. Moreover, the differences in the life-cycle CO2 corresponding to FA concrete among three different allocation types-no, mass, and economic value allocations-based on two functional units (FU)-per unit volume and per unit volume and strength were investigated. Finally, sustainable mix design method of FA concrete was established to find the optimal FAC mixtures and the correlation between CO2 emission and concrete mix parameters was analyzed by the maximal information correlation (MIC). The results indicate that the neural network model has a better regression effect than the multiple nonlinear regression model and other machine learning models on the prediction of compressive strength and CO2 emissions. For different functional units, the CO2 emissions under FU1 increases with the strength of concrete regardless of different allocation types; the CO2 emissions under FU2 varies considerably with changes in the amount of added FA under no allocation and economic value allocation. The CO2 emission under FU1 has a stronger correlation with various mix parameters than that under FU2.

However, existing network coding-based caching designs do not fully explore and exploit the potential advantages. In this paper, we consider the analysis and optimization of a random linear network coding-based caching design in large-scale successive interference cancelation (SIC)enabled wireless networks. By utilizing tools from stochastic geometry, we derive a tractable expression for the successful transmission probability in the general file size regime. To further obtain design insights, we also derive closed-form expressions for the successful transmission probability in the small and large file size regimes, respectively. Then, we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing a design parameter, which is a complex discrete optimization problem. We propose a two-stage optimization framework and obtain a near optimal solution with superior performance and manageable complexity. The analysis and optimization results provide valuable design insights for practical cache and SIC enabled wireless networks. Finally, by numerical results, we show that the proposed near optimal caching design achieves a significant performance gain over some baseline caching designs.

However, these techniques experience performance degradation when the compression ratio is increased to an extreme extent. In this paper, we propose Cascaded Mixed-precision Networks (CMNs), which are compact yet efficient neural networks without incurring performance drop. CMN is designed as a cascade framework by concatenating a group of neural networks with sequentially increased bitwidth. The execution flow of CMN is conditional on the difficulty of input samples, i.e., easy examples will be correctly classified by going through extremely low-bitwidth networks, and hard examples will be handled by high-bitwidth networks, so that the average compute is reduced. In addition, weight pruning is incorporated into the cascaded framework and jointly optimized with the mixed-precision quantization. To validate this method, we implemented a 2-stage CMN consisting of a binary neural network and a multi-bit (e.g. 8 bits) neural network. Empirical results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that CMN performs better than state-of-the-art methods, in terms of accuracy and compute.

J	Sun, QM; Yan, Y; Xu, YH; Yu, JJ				Sun, Qiming; Yan, Ying; Xu, Yihan; Yu, Jingjing			Multidimensional-Taylor-network-based robust optimal tracking control for MIMO nonlinear discrete-time systems	ISA TRANSACTIONS												In practical engineering, system control is indispensable. However, due to the influence of model uncertainty, speed unavailability, input nonlinearity (such as actuator dead zone/fault), and multi-input coupling, the control results are not satisfactory. In this paper, a robust optimal tracking control strategy is proposed for a class of nonlinear multi-input-multi-output discrete-time systems with unknown uncertainties. This control strategy is to minimize the cost function in the process of uncertainty processing and stabilize the closed-loop system by establishing an adaptive controlling approach based on a combination of actor MTN and critic MTN based on the Multi-dimensional Taylor Network (MTN). By using the approximation property of MTN, the optimal control signal is generated by action MTN, which is used to approach the controller, and the cost function is approximated by critic MTN, which is tuned online because the cost function cannot be obtained in hands-on experience. By designing a new cost function, the amount of calculation in the control process is reduced, and the adaptive critic design control idea is integrated into the controller design to deal with the uncertainty of the system. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the control strategy proposed in the essay. (c) 2023 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we address the network design problem specific to packaged gases (cylinder) supply chain. We propose an integrated framework that allows for the determination of the optimal facility locations, the filling plant production capacities, the inventory at plants and hubs, and the number of packages to be routed in primary and secondary transportation. Design/methodology/approach: We formulate the problem as a mixed integer program and then develop a decomposition approach to solve it. We illustrate the proposed framework with numerical examples from real-life packaged gases supply chain. The results show that the decomposition approach is effective in solving a broad range of problem sizes. Findings: The main finding of this paper is that decomposing the network design problem into two sub-problems is very effective to tackle the real-life large scale network design problems occurring in cylinder gas distribution by optimizing strategic and tactical decisions and approximating the operational decisions. We also benchmark the results from the decomposition approach by solving the complete packaged gases network design model for smaller test cases. Originality/value: The main contribution of our work is that it integrates supply chain network design decisions without fixing the fillings plant locations with inventory and resource allocation decisions required at the plants. We also consider the transportation costs for the entire supply chain including the transhipment costs among different facilities by deciding the replenishment frequency.																			2013-8423	2013-0953					2015	8	1					85	109		10.3926/jiem.1140	http://dx.doi.org/10.3926/jiem.1140													WOS:000363776600006

One of the most challenging problems is related to the design and implementation of neural networks in engineering design tasks. The successful design and practical applications of neural network models depend on their qualitative properties. Elaborating efficient stability is known to be of a high importance. Also, different stability notions are applied for differently behaving models. In addition, uncertainties are ubiquitous in neural network systems, and may result in performance degradation, hazards or system damage. Driven by practical needs and theoretical challenges, the rigorous handling of uncertainties in the neural network design stage is an essential research topic. In this research, the concept of robust practical stability is introduced for generalized discrete neural network models under uncertainties applied in engineering design. A robust practical stability analysis is offered using the Lyapunov function method. Since practical stability concept is more appropriate for engineering applications, the obtained results can be of a practical significance to numerous engineering design problems of diverse interest.																			1311-9702	1314-4081				DEC 1	2021	21	4					3	14		10.2478/cait-2021-0039	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/cait-2021-0039													WOS:000734993400001

Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm was shown by a numerical example.																					978-1-6654-2314-4				2020							1210	1215		10.1109/ICMCCE51767.2020.00267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICMCCE51767.2020.00267													WOS:000675598100258
J	Huang, YK; Lin, LF				Huang, Yuan-Ko; Lin, Lien-Fa			Efficient processing of <i>continuous min-max distance bounded query</i> with updates in road networks	INFORMATION SCIENCES												In the last decade, the research community focuses on the design of various methods in support of spatio-temporal queries in road networks. In this paper, we present a novel and important query, named the continuous min-max distance bounded query (CM(2)DBQ). Given a moving query object q, a minimal distance d(m), and a maximal distance d(M), a CM(2)DBQ retrieves the bounded objects whose road distances to q are within the range [d(m), d(M)] at each time instant. We propose two algorithms, named the Continuous Within Query-based (CWQ-based) algorithm and the CM(2)DBQ algorithm, to efficiently determine the bounded objects. In addition, we design a mechanism, named the bounded objects updating mechanism, to rapidly evaluate the new query result when object updates occur. Extensive experiments using real road network dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and the usefulness of the bounded objects updating mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The network design problem can be formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) where the user equilibrium with variable demand is expressed as a variational inequality problem. Due to the non-differentiability of the perturbed solutions in equilibrium constraints, a non-smooth optimization model is established. A generalized bundle subgradient projection is presented to effectively solve the network design problem. Global convergence analysis for the proposed method is also delivered. Numerical calculations are conducted and promising results have shown potential of the proposed method in solving network design problem when compared to earlier studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Although QKD has been widely implemented in many urban fiber networks, the large-scale deployment of QKD remains challenging. Today, researchers extensively conduct simulation-based evaluations for their designs and applications of large-scale QKD networks for cost efficiency. However, the existing discrete-event simulators offer models for QKD hardware and protocols based on sequential event execution, which limits the scale of the experiments. In this work, we explore parallel simulation of QKD networks to address this issue. Our contributions lay in the exploration of QKD network characteristics to be leveraged for parallel simulation as well as the development of a parallel simulation framework for QKD networks. We also investigate three techniques to improve the simulation performance including (1) a ladder queue based event list, (2) memoization for computationally intensive quantum state transformation information, and (3) optimization of the network partition scheme for workload balance. The experimental results show that our parallel simulator is 10 times faster than a sequential simulator when simulating a 128-node QKD network. Our linear-regressionbased network partition scheme can further accelerate the simulation experiments up to two times over using a randomized network partition scheme.

Adaptive discrete-time grid-voltage sensorless interfacing scheme for grid-connected DG-inverters based on neural-network identification and deadbeat current regulation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS												This paper presents an adaptive discrete-time grid-voltage sensorless interfacing scheme for grid-connected distributed generation inverters, based on neural network identification and deadbeat current regulation. First, a novel neural network-based estimation unit is designed with low computational demand to estimate, in real-time, the interfacing parameters and the grid voltage vector simultaneously. A reliable solution to the present nonlinear estimation problem is presented by combining a neural network interfacing-parameters identifier with a neural network grid-voltage estimator. Second, an adaptive deadbeat current controller is designed with high bandwidth characteristics by adopting a delay compensation method. The delay compensation method utilizes the predictive nature of the estimated quantities to compensate for total system delays and to enable real-time design of the deadbeat controller. Third, the estimated grid voltage is utilized to realize a grid-voltage sensorless average-power control loop, which guarantees high power quality injection. Theoretical analysis and comparative evaluation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.					Mohamed, Yasser A.-R. I./AAF-2290-2019	Mohamed, Yasser A.-R.

The proposed neural observer does not need previous knowledge of the model about the system under consideration, neither the value of its parameters, delays, nor their explicit estimations. The proposed neural observer is based on a neural network composed of two recurrent high order neural networks (RHONNs) for nonmeasurable state variables, one in a parallel configuration, and for measurable state variables one in a series-parallel configuration. The neural network is trained on-line with an extended Kalman filter algorithm. The proposed RHONN observer provides a mathematical model for the system. Based on such a resulting mathematical model, a control law is designed using discrete-time sliding mode block control. Applicability is presented using real-time results that show the performance of the proposal using a linear induction motor prototype as the selected system; this prototype is under the presence of varying time-delays. A Lyapunov analysis is included to prove the semi-globally uniformly ultimately boundedness (SGUUB) of the proposed RHONN observer-controller scheme for uncertain nonlinear discrete-time systems with unknown delays.

In urban transportation network, unreasonable phenomenon can occur in certain traffic period (e.g. on/off duty period), which demonstrates that the flows of opposite directions on a two-way road are seriously asymmetric; one traffic link of a two-way road congest heavily but the other is hardly used. In order to reduce transportation congestion and make full use of the existing road resources, we propose a lane reallocating approach in peak period, and establish a discrete bi-level programming model for the decision-making. Then, based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, a heuristic solution algorithm for the bi-level model is designed.

A function approximator is used to construct the controller, and here, it is fixed as a neural network (NN), whose structure is fixed previously, while allowing its connecting weights to be updated. The control parameters are then the connecting weights of the NN controller. The biggest advantage of this data-driven control approach is that it can generate a control signal to affect system's future performance without establishing the plant's mathematical model first. In this novel approach, to improve the control ability and accuracy, an adaptive weighted gradient estimation method is designed to do the parametric estimation with convergence analysis. Non-linear tracking problems for typical discrete-time non-linear plants are introduced for simulation comparison tests, and the convergence and feasibility of this newly proposed data-driven control strategy are well demonstrated through the simulation results. Finally, empirical study on a simulated wastewater treatment system is carried out to further illustrate the effectiveness of this newly proposed approach.

Specifically, in this work, the network design problem aims to select the optimal planning policy from a set of infrastructure design scenarios considering both road expansions and charging station allocations under a specified construction budget. The user-equilibrium mixed-vehicular traffic assignment problem with en-route recharge (MVTAP-ER) is formulated into a novel convex optimization model and extended to a newly developed bi-level program of the aggregated NDP integrating recharge facility allocation (NDP-RFA). In the algorithmic framework, a convex optimization technique and a tailored GA are adopted for, respectively, solving the subproblem MVTAP-ER and the primal problem NDP-RFA. Systematic experiments are conducted to test the efficacy of the proposed approaches. The results highlight the impacts of distance limits and budget levels on the project selection and evaluation, and the benefits of considering both road improvement policy and recharge service provision as compared to accounting for the latter only. The results also report that the two design objectives, to respectively minimize the total system travel time and vehicle miles travelled, are conflicting for certain scenarios.

A two-tier architecture for networked process control	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Traditionally, process control systems utilize dedicated, point-to-point wired communication links using a small number of sensors and actuators to regulate appropriate process variables at desired values. While this paradigm to process control has been successful, chemical plant operation could substantially benefit from an efficient integration of the existing, point-to-point control networks (wired connections from each actuator/sensor to the control system using dedicated local area networks) with additional networked (wired or Wireless) actuator/sensor devices. However, augmenting existing control networks with real-time wired/wireless sensor and actuator networks challenges many of the assumptions made in the development of traditional process control methods dealing with dynamical systems linked through ideal channels with flawless, continuous communication. In the context of control systems which utilize networked sensors and actuators, key issues that need to be carefully handled at the control system design level include data losses due to field interference and time delays due to network traffic. Motivated by the above technological advances and the lack of methods to design control systems that utilize hybrid Communication networks, in the present work, we present a novel two-tier control architecture for networked process control problems that involve nonlinear processes and heterogeneous measurements consisting of continuous measurements and asynchronous, delayed measurements. This class of control problems arises naturally when nonlinear processes are controlled via control systems based on hybrid Communication networks (i.e., point-to-point wired links integrated with networked wired/wireless communication) or utilizing multiple heterogeneous measurements (e.g., temperature measurements which can be taken to be continuous and species concentration measurements which are fed to the control system at asynchronous time instants and frequently involve delays). While point-to-point wired links are very reliable, the presence of a shared communication network in the closed-loop system introduces additional delays and data losses and these issues should be handled at the controller design level. In the two-tier control architecture presented in this work, a lower-tier control system, which relies on point-to-point communication and continuous measurements, is first designed to stabilize the closed-loop system, and an upper-tier networked control system is subsequently designed, using Lyapunov-based model predictive control theory, to profit from both the continuous and the asynchronous, delayed measurements as well as from additional networked control actuators to improve the closed-loop system performance. The proposed two-tier control architecture preserves the stability properties of the lower-tier controller while improving the closed-loop performance. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated using two chemical process examples. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, AH; Zhang, L; Liu, ZY				Li, Ai-Hong; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Zhi-Yong			Synthesis of property-based total water systems with multiple interceptors by using operator potential concepts	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN												The synthesis of property-based total water networks with multiple interceptors is investigated by using operator potential concepts. Two kinds of network configurations are considered according to whether process sources are allowed to mix at inlet of the interceptors. For a non-mixing network, each interceptor treating one process source, the synthesis procedure is simple. However, too many interceptors might be needed and the corresponding costs will be high for the systems with a large number of process sources. For a mixing network, process sources are allowed to mix at inlet of the interceptors, the network construction can be simplified and the total annual costs can be reduced. An iteration procedure is proposed to design mixing-configuration networks. In the synthesis procedure, the values of operator potential of demands are used to determine the sequence of demands to be satisfied, the values of operator potential of sources are used to select the process sources to be treated. A linear programming approach is adopted to allocate the sources to each demand. The results of four examples obtained with the proposed methods show that the networks with lower fresh source consumption, or simpler structure, or lower total annual cost can be obtained compared to the literature results. In addition, the proposed methods have the features of simple calculation and clear engineering meaning. (c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The configuration and supervisory sub-system was implemented with a personal computer or an industrial personal computer; running subsystems were designed and implemented based on embedded hardware and software systems. Communication and schedule in the running subsystem was implemented with an embedded sub-module; discrete control and system self-diagnosis were implemented with another embedded sub-module. Structure of the proposed system was presented. Methodology for the design of the sub-systems was expounded. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed system both in discrete and process control by investigating the effect of network data transmission delay induced by the soft PLC in WorldFIP network and CPU workload on resulting control performances. The experimental observations indicated that the proposed system is practically applicable. (C) 2011 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In fact, a transportation network may comprise of multiple local administrative regions, which might be independently and separately managed by multiple local transportation administrative authorities with mutual competitive objectives. In this paper, we propose competitive and cooperative schemes of CNDP in multiple regions. We also investigate the mixed behavior of cooperation and competition among multiple (more than two) regions. Based on two numerical examples, we also discussed the impacts of budget allocation, OD demand level, and network structure, on the outcome of network design in various regional interaction schemes.

An event-triggered controller with the static and dynamic event-triggering conditions is designed to improve the efficiency of resource utilization. By constructing a new Lyapunov function, some sufficient criteria are obtained to realize the exponential synchronization of considered drive-response MNNs under the designed event-triggered controller. In addition, the Zeno behavior will not occur by proving that the event-triggering interval has a positive lower bound under different event-triggering conditions. Finally, a numerical example is provided to prove the validity of our theoretical results.

This problem is normally solved considering only one-leg, multi-leg and ferry routes. Assessing the value of more complex route types is an open question of academic and practical importance. In this article, we present a mixed integer programming model that includes five types of complex routes: two-hub, transload, direct, inter-hub and early routes. We assess their economic impact by performing many experiments built from an instance provided by FedEx Express Europe. Inter-hub and early routes have the best performance, with significant average savings (from 0.5% to 3.5%). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, J; Liu, FG; Cao, JN; Wang, LM				Yang, Jin; Liu, Fagui; Cao, Jianneng; Wang, Liangming			Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks with Multiple Mobile Sinks	SENSORS												Mobile sinks can achieve load-balancing and energy-consumption balancing across the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the frequent change of the paths between source nodes and the sinks caused by sink mobility introduces significant overhead in terms of energy and packet delays. To enhance network performance of WSNs with mobile sinks (MWSNs), we present an efficient routing strategy, which is formulated as an optimization problem and employs the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to build the optimal routing paths. However, the conventional PSO is insufficient to solve discrete routing optimization problems. Therefore, a novel greedy discrete particle swarm optimization with memory (GMDPSO) is put forward to address this problem. In the GMDPSO, particle's position and velocity of traditional PSO are redefined under discrete MWSNs scenario. Particle updating rule is also reconsidered based on the subnetwork topology of MWSNs. Besides, by improving the greedy forwarding routing, a greedy search strategy is designed to drive particles to find a better position quickly. Furthermore, searching history is memorized to accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that our new protocol significantly improves the robustness and adapts to rapid topological changes with multiple mobile sinks, while efficiently reducing the communication overhead and the energy consumption.					li, xiaomin/KCX-9845-2024	Jin, Yang/0000-0002-1654-5414														1424-8220				JUL	2016	16	7							1081	10.3390/s16071081	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s16071081								27428971					WOS:000380967000138

Understanding mixing patterns can provide insight about potential transmission pathways throughout a community. We used a snowball sampling design to enroll people recently diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in an ethnically and racially diverse county and asked them to describe their close contacts and recruit some contacts to enroll in the study. We constructed egocentric networks of the participants and their contacts and assessed age-mixing, ethnic/racial homophily, and gender homophily. The total size of the egocentric networks was 2,544 people (n = 384 index cases + n = 2,160 recruited peers or other contacts). We observed high rates of in-group mixing among ethnic/racial groups compared to the ethnic/racial proportions of the background population. Black or African-American respondents interacted with a wider range of ages than other ethnic/racial groups, largely due to familial relationships. The egocentric networks of non-binary contacts had little age diversity. Black or African-American respondents in particular reported mixing with older or younger family members, which could increase the risk of transmission to vulnerable age groups. Understanding community mixing patterns can inform infectious disease risk, support analyses to predict epidemic size, or be used to design campaigns such as vaccination strategies so that community members who have vulnerable contacts are prioritized.

J	Afshar, MH				Afshar, M. H.			Rebirthing genetic algorithm for storm sewer network design	SCIENTIA IRANICA												Application of standard binary coded genetic algorithms for the solution of problems with continuous design variables requires discretization of the continuous decision variables. Coarse discretization of the design variables could adversely affect the final solution, while finer discretization would increasingly enlarge the scale of the problem, leading to higher computation cost. A rebirthing procedure is used in this paper as a remedy for the problem just outlined. The method is based on the idea of limiting the originally wide search space to a smaller one once a locally converged solution is obtained. The smaller search space is designed to contain the locally optimum solution at its center. The resulting search space is refined and a completely new search is conducted to find a better solution. The procedure is continued until no refinement is necessary or no improvement could be made by further refinement. The method is applied to a benchmark problem of a storm water network design, and the results are compared with those of the existing method. The method is shown to be very effective, efficient and insensitive to the population size of the genetic search and the search space size of the optimization problem.

Appropriately designed dynamic quantizers can reduce this performance degradation. However, most of the existing dynamic quantizers are based on a model of the plant and in many situations this model cannot be used. Therefore, this study proposes a type of quantizer implemented with a neural network and a design method based on a series of input and outputs of the plant. Then, this quantizer does not need a plant model, and could be applied to any type of system. The effectiveness of the proposed quantizer and its design method are verified with several numerical examples.

With this technique, an area-efficient transconductance network is used to replace the large resistors in low-frequency integrator-based continuous-time filters. The key challenge with this technique is in determining and realizing the appropriate relationship between the transconductance circuit and the nonideal frequency-dependent properties of the opamp. Simulation results for a third-order Bessel low-pass filter designed in a 0.5u CMOS process with a cutoff frequency of 5 KHz provide a THD in excess of 70 dB for a 2V p-p output with the 5 V power supply.																									2002							356	359																WOS:000181396200091

The secondary aim was to demonstrate the application of social network research to the field of LHS. Design Two longitudinal online questionnaires of the Australian Genomics learning community considering relationships between network members at three time points: 2016, 2018, 2019. The questionnaire included closed Likert response questions on collaborative learning patterns and open-response questions to capture general perceptions of the community. Social network data were analysed and visually constructed using Gephi V.0.9.2 software, Likert questions were analysed using SPSS, and open responses were analysed thematically using NVivo. Setting Australian Genomic Health Alliance. Participants Clinicians, scientists, researchers and community representatives. Results Australian Genomics members highlighted the collaborative benefits of the network as a learning community to foster continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of clinical genomics. The learning community grew from 186 members (2016), to 384 (2018), to 439 (2019). Network density increased (2016=0.023, 2018=0.043), then decreased (2019=0.036). Key players remained consistent with potential for new members to achieve focal positions in the network. Informal learning was identified as the most influential learning method for genomic practice. Conclusions This study shows that intentionally building a network provides a platform for continuous learning-a fundamental component for establishing an LHS. The Australian Genomics learning community shows evidence of maturity and sustainability in supporting the continuous learning culture of clinical genomics. The network provides a practical means to spread new knowledge and best practice across the entire field. We show that intentionally designed networks provide the opportunity and means for interdisciplinary learning between diverse agents over time and demonstrate the application of social network research to the LHS field.

However, deploying CNNs on resource-constrained edge devices is constrained by limited memory bandwidth for transmitting large intermediated data during inference, i.e., activation. Existing research utilizes mixed-precision and dimension reduction to reduce computational complexity but pays less attention to its application for activation compression. To further exploit the redundancy in activation, we propose a learnable mixed-precision and dimension reduction co-design system, which separates channels into groups and allocates specific compression policies according to their importance. In addition, the proposed dynamic searching technique enlarges search space and finds out the optimal bit-width allocation automatically. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods improve 3.54%/1.27% in accuracy and save 0.18/2.02 bits per value over existing mixed-precision methods on ResNet18 and MobileNetv2, respectively.																			1520-6130		978-1-6654-8524-1				2022							162	167		10.1109/SIPS55645.2022.9919207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SIPS55645.2022.9919207													WOS:001081960800028

Ports of a modal network correspond to waveguide eigenmodes on either side of the discontinuity. In this work, modal network theory is extended beyond conventional/geometrical waveguide discontinuities. We use the modal network formulation to analyze discontinuities resulting from metasurfaces. Specifically, we analyze azimuthally invariant cascaded sheet metasurfaces placed in a cylindrical waveguide excited by TM0n modes. The metasurface comprises multiple radially varying electric admittance sheets separated by dielectric spacers. We derive the modal representation of a single inhomogeneous, electric sheet admittance using two approaches: a conventional numerical integration approach and a discrete Hankel transform (DHT) approach. We show that the DHT approach is more efficient. Subsequently, the modal matrices of cascaded sheet metasurfaces are derived using the DHT. Finally, we propose an optimization-based procedure to synthesize transparent metasurface-based mode converters. The mode converters transform a set of incident modes on one side to another set of desired modes on the opposite side of the metasurface. Two designs are synthesized at 10 GHz: a single-mode converter, and a mode splitter. The designs are verified using the commercial finite element electromagnetic solvers.

The packet loss and time delay in the network are modeled by a set of switches, using that a discrete-time switched system is formulated. First, results for the exponential dissipativity of discrete-time switched system with time-varying delays are proposed by using the average dwell time approach and multiple Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Then, the results are extended to drive the controller design for considered wireless NCS. The attention is focused on designing an observer-based state feedback controller which ensures that, for all network-induced delay and packet loss, the resulting error system is exponentially stable and strictly (Q,S,R) dissipative. The sufficient conditions for existence of controllers are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily solved using some standard numerical packages. Both observer and controller gains can be obtained by the solutions of set of LMIs. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

A bilevel programming technique can be used to formulate this equilibrium network design problem. At the upper level problem, the system performance index is defined as the sum of total travel times and investment costs of link capacity expansions. At the lower level problem. the user equilibrium flow is determined by Wardrop's first principle and can be formulated as an equivalent minimization problem. In this paper we exploit a descent approach via the implementation of gradient-based methods to solve CNDP generally where the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points can be obtained. Four variants of gradient-based methods are presented and numerical comparisons are widely made with the previous on three kinds of test networks. The proposed methods have achieved substantially better results in terms of the robustness to the initials and the computational efficiency in solving equilibrium assignment problems than did others especially when the congested road networks are considered.

WSNs are large networks made of a numerous number of sensor nodes with sensing, computation, and wireless communications capabilities. Many various routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been designed for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) dependent on both the network architecture and the applications that it is designed for. Image compression is one such technology that has been used in WSN domains and then developed to reduce image size and used by WSN applications. Multimedia networked applications have become more and more feasible over WSNs. There is some research that presents constraints exactly to the use of wireless sensor networks for transporting multimedia applications such as image, video, etc. This paper represent the use of image compression over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in order to decrease the energy consumption of sensors and thus to maintain a long network lifetime.

Inspired by these works, we propose the use of a feedback controller designed using the Tikhonov method to regularize discrete-time linear systems subject to varying sampling rates. The goal is to minimize an error function, thus improving the performance of the closed loop system and reducing the possibility of instability. Illustrative examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method.																			1476-8186	1751-8520				JUN	2020	17	3					453	463		10.1007/s11633-019-1205-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11633-019-1205-8													WOS:000536413500010

Firstly, the T-S fuzzy model is employed to approximate the networked control system based on the system model. Secondly, the dynamic output feedback controller with hybrid intermittent feedback control law is designed for the T-S fuzzy networked control system. Thirdly, the delay-dependent stability conditions are derived by introducing the Lyapunov functional with Leibniz-Newton formula. Compared with previous works, both the mixed time-varying delays and interval distributed time-varying delays are considered in the T-S fuzzy networked control system. The control design conditions are relaxed because of the proposed controller. By introducing the Lyapunov functional with Leibniz-Newton formula, the linear matrix inequalities are solved effectively by the standard convex optimization algorithm. Finally, the simulation examples and some computing results are given to show the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed method, respectively.

DISCRETE NETWORK DESIGN: TIME AND LAND USE CONSIDERATION	TRANSPORTATION AND URBAN SUSTAINABILITY					15th International Conference of Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies	DEC 11-14, 2010	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA					A general time-dependent discrete network design framework is proposed in this study to incorporate the Lowry-type land use model and time dimension so that the land use transport interaction can be dealt with when determining the optimal design over time. Both link addition and link expansion are considered with capacity modelled as a discrete variable. Multimodal transport interaction is also captured in the framework. The framework is formulated as a single-level single-objective optimisation program, in which the objective function represents the concern of the decision maker. The decision maker can be the government or the private sector, depending on the source of funding for road improvements. The objective thus depends on who is the decision maker or builder/operator. In the case where the funding is wholly from the government who is in charge of road network design, the decision maker is the government and their objective can be alleviating congestion or maximizing societal benefit. More importantly, using the proposed framework, one can study the effect of road improvement policies on land use, the profits of landowners and their profit distribution as well as population and employment changes. To incorporate the considerations of various parties involved in road improvement projects, a multi-objective optimisation framework is also developed through the hybrid approach. This multi-objective framework can aid the government making decisions considering the objective of each related party and eliminating a large number of alternative designs without trial-and-error.

A multi-modal supply chain network design for recycling waterway sediments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												The French waterway system consists of large navigable rivers and canals connecting many regions. Maintaining a safe navigation channel, in the Nord-Pas De Calais (NPDC) region in France, requires the regular removal of accumulated sediments which are often contaminated with zinc, lead, cadmium, and mercury. New legislations, such as the European Water Framework Directive (DCA, 2000), ensure that disposal should be reduced to minimal level and the waterways sediment should be treated. Such measures increase the research interest to find the potential costumers and create the need for establishing an efficient waterway sediment network. This paper discusses the design of a multi-modal supply chain network (SCN) in order to satisfy the demand of the treated sediments and to respect environmental, social and economic requirements. First, we reviewed models for strategic supply chain network design. After that, we proposed a multi-modal, single period, supply chain network design (SCND) model for waterway sediments problem using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach. Then, results obtained solving a real case SCND model of French waterways (Voies Navigables de France: VNF) in NPDC region are presented. Finally, we present the most important results and future research opportunities.

While the social dimension is sometime harder to capture or quantify in mathematical terms, the Emission Trading Schema (ETS) introduces a natural trade-off between the economic and the environmental dimensions. This article addresses the design of supply chains that are sensitive to the carbon market where carbon emissions (environmental dimension) and total logistics costs (economic dimension) are integrated in the design of the supply chain using a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model that is solved by goal programming. The approach is presented through an illustrative example in the steel industry where new legislation imposes regulatory carbon caps on emissions. The results show that this approach is viable and offers a good starting point for a comprehensive framework for sustainable supply chain network design that can be expanded to include social aspects relating to the community.

In particular, a discrete-time CNN model is introduced and the global asymptotic stability of its equilibrium point is analyzed. By taking into account such stability results, a novel technique for designing associative memories is developed. The objective is achieved by satisfying frequency domain stability criteria via feedback parameters related to circulant matrices. The approach, by generating CNN's where the input data are fed via external inputs rather than initial conditions, enables both hetero-associative and auto-associative memories to be designed. Finally, two examples highlight the capabilities of the designed networks in storing and retrieving information.

This paper presents models to choose supply facilities and determine distribution options while considering the expected risk of not serving customers attributed to supply shortages. The goal is to design a reliable network with a lower cost under traditional cost objectives. We formulate a stochastic mixed-integer biobjective programming model considering the protection of facilities and solve this problem with a progressive hedging algorithm (PHA). We examine the tradeoff curve between the cost and risk through a case study involving Shanghai in China. The results indicate that substantial improvements in reliability can be reached with a limited increase in the total cost.																			0020-7543	1366-588X				JUN 3	2023	61	11			SI		3621	3633		10.1080/00207543.2021.1994163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2021.1994163		OCT 2021											WOS:000713506800001

J	Jiang, S; Fang, HJ				Jiang, Shun; Fang, Huajing			Quantized stabilization of discrete-time systems in a networked environment	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING												This paper is concerned with the problem of output feedback stabilization for a class of discrete-time systems with sector nonlinearities and imperfect measurements. A unified control law model is proposed to take the network-induced delay, random packet dropout and measurement quantization into consideration simultaneously. By choosing appropriate Lyapunov functional, a new stability condition, which is dependent on multiple network status, is established for the resulting closed-loop system. Based on the result, a design criterion for the static output feedback controller is formulated in the form of nonconvex matrix inequalities, and the cone complementary linearization (CCL) procedure is exploited to solve the nonconvex feasibility problem. Incidentally, a less conservative synthesis method is also developed for the state feedback stabilization purpose. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
