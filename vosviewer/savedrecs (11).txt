The network under investigation is quite general to reflect the reality, where the state, delays are allowed to be time varying with given lower and upper bounds, and the stochastic disturbances are assumed to be Brownian motions that affect not only the network coupling but also the overall networks. By utilizing the Lyapunov functional method combined with linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, we obtain several sufficient delay-dependent conditions that ensure the coupled networks to be globally exponentially synchronized in the mean square. A control law is designed to synchronize the addressed coupled complex networks in terms of certain LMIs that can be readily solved using the Matlab LMI toolbox. Two, numerical examples are presented to show the validity of our theoretical analysis results.

An asynchronous estimator is designed to overcome the difficulty that each node cannot access to the topology/coupling information. Also, the event-based communication, signal quantization, and the random packet dropout problems are studied due to the limited communication resource. With the help of switched system theory and by resorting to some stochastic system analysis method, a sufficient condition is proposed to guarantee the exponential stability of estimation error system in the mean-square sense and a prescribed H-infinity performance level is also ensured. The characterization of the desired estimator gains is derived in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed design approach is demonstrated by a simulation example.

The phenomenon of multiple fading measurements is represented by a set of individual stochastic variables obeying a predetermined distribution on interval [0,1]. Firstly, the augmented system comprised of MNNs and the dynamics of estimation errors are put forward to implement the performance analysis. Then, under the framework of the difference inclusion theory combined with the Lyapunov function method, several sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the exponential mean-square stability as well as H-infinity performance index. Furthermore, the desired estimator parameter is obtained in view of the solution of a convex optimization problem. In the end, an illustrative numerical example is exploited to check the reliability and usefulness of the design scheme in this paper.

Loop delay estimation online is designed to overcome the adverse influence caused by time-varying delay. Considering mismatched uncertainties, an asymptotically stable sliding mode surface is designed by means of linear matrix inequality (LMI).

Compared with single systems, the FD problem is hardly solved due to the unmeasurable interconnection signals composed by neighboring subsystems states. To overcome this difficulty, the unmeasurable interconnection terms are estimated within the data-driven framework firstly. Then, a residual generator is designed in terms of the input and output data. Moreover, considered the freedom degree in design of the residual generator, an H-/H-infinity mixed optimization scheme is proposed to enhance the sensitivity to the actuator faults as well as the robustness against the measurement noises. Based on it, actuator faults with smaller magnitude can be detected. Also, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed FD approach are verified by a numerical example. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

J	Liu, CW; Fu, J; Xu, Q				Liu, Chaowei; Fu, Jie; Xu, Qiang			Simultaneous mixed-integer dynamic optimization for environmentally benign electroplating	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Hoist scheduling, especially cyclic hoist scheduling (CHS), is used to maximize the manufacturing productivity of electroplating processes. Water-reuse network design (WRND) for the electroplating rinsing system targets the optimal water allocation, such that fresh water consumption and wastewater generation are minimized. Currently, there is still a lack of studies on integrating CHS and WRND technologies for electroplating manufacturing. In this paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) model has been developed to integrate CHS and WRND technologies for simultaneous consideration of productivity and water use efficiency for environmentally benign electroplating. The orthogonal collocation method on finite elements is employed to convert the MIDO problem into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated by solving a real electroplating example. It demonstrates that the computational methods of production scheduling, process design, and dynamic optimization can be effectively integrated to create economic and environmental win-win situations for the electroplating industry.

The company wanted to examine the effects of product reallocations within its production network on overall network costs, because it anticipated that its historically evolved structure was in need of revision. To support the company in doing so, we built a mixed integer linear programming model depicting large parts of the firm's production network.

The supply chain systems consist of a number of external suppliers, candidate manufacturing sites, and a number of customers at fixed locations. The design model is a mixed-integer linear programming optimization routine that minimizes the total time-discounted network cost. The model generates a system configuration that specifies the location and capacity of the manufacturing sites, the material flow, and the transportation routes within the network.

Efficient Design Space Exploration for Sparse Mixed Precision Neural Architectures	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 31ST INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HIGH-PERFORMANCE PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING, HPDC 2022					31st International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC)	JUN 27-30, 2022	Minneapolis, MN	Assoc Comp Machinery, ACM SIGARCH, ACM SIGHPC				Pruning and Quantization are two effective Deep Neural Network (DNN) compression methods for efficient inference on various hardware platforms. Pruning refers to removing unimportant weights or nodes, whereas Quantization converts the floating-point parameters to low-bit fixed integer representation. The pruned and low precision models result in smaller and faster inference models on hardware platforms with almost the same accuracy as the unoptimized network. Tensor Cores in Nvidia Ampere 100 (A100) GPU supports (1) 2:4 fine-grained sparse pruning where 2 out of every 4 elements are pruned, and (2) traditional dense multiplication to achieve a good accuracy and performance trade-off. The A100 Tensor Core also takes advantage of 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit multiplication to speed up the inference of a model. Hence, finding the right matrix type (dense or 2:4 sparse) along with the precision for each layer becomes a combinatorial problem. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can alleviate such problems by automating the architecture design process instead of a brute-force search. In this paper, we propose (i) Mixed Sparse and Precision Search (MSPS), a NAS framework to search for efficient sparse and mixed-precision quantized model within the predefined search space and fixed backbone neural network (Eg. ResNet50), and (ii) Architecture, Sparse and Precision Search (ASPS) to jointly search for kernel size and number of filters, and sparse-precision combination of each layer. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methods targeting A100 Tensor Core on Nvidia GPUs by searching efficient sparse-mixed precision networks on ResNet50 and achieving better accuracy-latency trade-off models compared to the manually designed Uniform Sparse Int8 networks.

First it is pointed out that some subsystems must be unstable to ensure stability of the overall system in some special cases. Then a special kind of decentralized control problem is studied. This kind of problem can be viewed as harmonic control among independent subsystems. Research results show that two unstable systems can generate a stable system through some effective cooperations. In addition, a decentralized controller design method based on linear matrix inequality is also given by using parameter-dependent Lyapunov function method developed for the study of robust stability. A special linear star coupled dynamical network is also considered. The central subsystem must be unstable to stabilize the whole network under a special coupling. Several examples are given to illustrate the results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the closed-loop NCS with network-induced imperfections is modeled as a discrete-time switched system with uncertain parameters. Then a sufficient condition is proposed for exponential stability of the NCS through using the average dwell time method of switched systems and parameter-dependent Lyapunov functional. Furthermore, the filter gains and scheduling strategy are co-designed based on linear matrix inequality approach.

The packet dropout is assumed to be existing in the sensor-to-controller link, and two independent Bernoulli distributed white sequences are used to describe the packet dropouts. A fault detection observer is designed to increase the fault sensitivity and attenuate the effects of disturbances. Based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) techniques, a sufficient condition is derived such that the robust fault detection system is uniformly bounded mean-square stable and satisfies the prescribed H-infinity performance constraint.

J	Jagannathan, S; He, PA				Jagannathan, Sarangapani; He, Pingan			Neural-Network-Based State Feedback Control of a Nonlinear Discrete-Time System in Nonstrict Feedback Form	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS												In this paper, a suite or adaptive neural network (NN) controllers is designed to deliver a desired tracking performance for the control of an unknown, second-order, nonlinear discrete-time system expressed in nonstrict feedback form. In the first approach, two feedforward NNs are employed in the controller with tracking error as the feedback variable whereas in the adaptive critic NN architecture, three feedforward NNs are used. In the adaptive critic architecture, two action NNs produce virtual and actual control inputs, respectively, whereas the third critic NN approximates certain strategic utility function and its output is employed for tuning action NN weights in order to attain the near-optimal control action. Both the NN control methods present a well-defined controller design and the non-causal problem in discrete-time backstepping design is avoided via NN approximation. A comparison between the controller methodologies is highlighted. The stability analysis of the closed-loop control schemes is demonstrated. The NN controller schemes do not require an offline learning phase and the NN weights can be initialized at zero or random. Results show that the performance of the proposed controller schemes is highly satisfactory while meeting the closed-loop stability.																			1045-9227	1941-0093				DEC	2008	19	12					2073	2087		10.1109/TNN.2008.2003295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2003295								19054732					WOS:000261544900008

Social network analysis is one of the theoretical underpinnings of social computing. Community structure detection is believed to be an effective tool for social network analysis. Uncovering community structures in social networks can be regarded as clustering optimization problems. Because social networks are characterized by dynamics and huge volumes of data, conventional nature-inspired optimization algorithms encounter serious challenges when applied to solving large-scale social network clustering optimization problems. In this study, we put forward a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm to reveal community structures in social networks. The particle statuses are redefined under a discrete scenario. The status updating rules are reconsidered based on the network topology. A greedy strategy is designed to drive particles to a promising region. To this end, a greedy discrete particle swarm optimization framework for large-scale social network clustering is suggested. To determine the performance of the algorithm, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world social networks are carried out. We also compare the proposed algorithm with several state-of-the-art network community clustering methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and promising for social network clustering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recently, deep-learning-based classification methods, especially those using transformer networks, have achieved remarkable success. However, deep learning classification methods for multisource data still encounter various technical challenges, such as comprehensive utilization of multiscale information, lightweight network design, and efficient fusion strategies for heterogeneous data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient deep neural network, namely, multiscale 3-D-2-D mixed CNN feature extraction and multisource data lightweight attention-free fusion network (M2FNet) based on CNN and transformer. Through end-to-end training, this network effectively combines heterogeneous information from multiple sources, leading to improved performance in joint classification. Specifically, M2FNet uses a multiscale 3-D-2-D mixed CNN design to extract both the spatial-spectral features of HSI and the depth-based elevation features of LiDAR data. Subsequently, the extracted features are fed into a novel encoder comprising a feature enhancement (FE) module, designed with mathematical morphology and a dilated convolutional module derived from the self-attention of the conventional transformer encoder (DConvformer), which plays a crucial role in integrating multisource information within the network. The well-designed architecture enables the network to acquire multiscale depth and high-order features, significantly reducing the number of training parameters. Comparative experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate that M2FNet outperforms other advanced methods.

The stability and tracking performance of the closed-loop network control system under the event-triggering strategy is formally proven based on the Lyapunov theory in a hybrid framework. The proposed Lyapunov formulation yields an event-triggered algorithm to update the control input and NN weights based on conditions involving the closed-loop state. Different from the existing traditional NN control schemes where the feedback signals are transmitted and executed periodically, the feedback signals are transmitted and executed only when the event-trigger error exceeds the specified threshold, which can largely reduce the communication load. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through a simulation example.

Cordon-Based Pricing Schemes for Mixed Urban-Freeway Networks using Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												The development of traffic models based on macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFD) enables many real-time control strategies for urban networks, including cordon-based pricing schemes. However, most existing MFD-based pricing strategies are designed only to optimize the traffic-related performance, without considering the revenue collected by operators. In this study, we investigate cordon-based pricing schemes for mixed networks with urban networks and freeways. In this system, heterogeneous commuters choose their routes based on the user equilibrium principle. There are two types of operational objective for operating urban networks: (1) to optimize the urban network's performance, that is, to maximize the outflux; and (2) to maximize the revenue for operators. To compare those two objectives, we first apply feedback control to design pricing schemes to optimize the urban network's performance. Then, we formulate an optimal control problem to obtain the revenue-maximization pricing scheme. With numerical examples, we illustrate the difference between those pricing schemes.

Due to the co-existing of pyridine ring, carbonyl group, amide group and triazine ring in the non-conjugated flexible organic network on the silica surface, the developed mixed-mode stationary phase exhibits multiple interactions between the stationary phase and the analytes during the separation process. A variety of nucleoside bases, organic acids, antibiotics, pesticides, alkylbenzenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and sulfonamides achieved ideal resolution and flexible selectivity in separation. Compared with the commercial chromatographic columns under their optimized chromatographic conditions, it shows better performance for the separation of complex analytes. The influence of chromatographic conditions on retention behavior indicates that the column's multiple retention mechanisms make it suitable for mixed-mode liquid chromatography. The stationary phase prepared by the new design strategy also has excellent chromatographic reproducibility, repeatability and stability with the intraday RSD of 0.09%-0.12% (n = 10) and the interday RSD of 0.37%-1.64% (n = 5) for the retention time. The separation results of actual samples also prove its potential in the analysis of complex samples. In short, we designed and prepared the non-conjugated flexible network modified silica stationary phase material for liquid chromatography that is different from organic framework materials. Its excellent separation ability shows that we have successfully reported a new kind of liquid chromatography packing with functional design and facile preparation method.																			0039-9140	1873-3573				OCT 1	2021	233								122548	10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122548	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122548		MAY 2021						34215051					WOS:000668000500070

The machine is modeled by the method using a combination of flux path and cross-shaped mesh, with full consideration of the effects of permanent magnet leakage and machine core saturation. Meanwhile, the connection relationship between the stator and rotor models can be continuously varied to simulate the rotation of the machine. The continuous variable magnetic network model is further combined with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for the optimal design of the machine. Compared to the conventional FEA method, the proposed model reduces the computation time without sacrificing accuracy in both no-load and loaded magnetic field calculations. Finally, the experimental results verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.																			1975-0102	2093-7423				2024 FEB 9	2024										10.1007/s42835-024-01789-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42835-024-01789-9		FEB 2024											WOS:001159423500001

The delayed states involved in the system are arguments of a nonlinear function and only the estimated delay is utilized. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, the delay estimation error is considered in the observer parameter design. The proposed method is then extended to the system with a nonlinear output measurement equation and the delayed dynamics. With the help of a high-order neural network (HONN), the requirement for a precise system model, the linear-in-the-parameters (LIP) assumption of the delayed states, the Lipschitz or norm-boundedness assumption of unknown nonlinearities are removed. A novel converse Lyapunov technical lemma is also developed and used to prove the uniform ultimate boundedness of the proposed observer. The effectiveness of the proposed results is verified by simulations. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In order to reduce network transmission burden and prevent data collision, the round-robin (RR) protocol is employed to schedule the transmission order of the nodes. The purpose of the problem addressed is to design a novel interval estimator consisting of two coupled sub-estimators for DSSs with the bounded noises, such that 1) the error dynamics of the estimation upper bound and estimation lower bound are asymptotically stable, 2) the effect from the bounded noises on the estimation accuracy is attenuated at a given level by means of anH(infinity)norm. Based on the positive system theory combined with the Lyapunov stability theory, the real state is ensured in the interval, whose bounded is determined by the estimation upper bound and estimation lower bound. Moreover, the desired gains are obtained by solving a class of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed interval estimator is verified by two numerical examples.

The proposed controller is an ideal controller with multidimensional gain based on the global space- time in the iteration domain. The control gain is automatically learned by updating the matrix of the GRNN with correction factors based on the accumulation of global system input and output (I/O) data along the iteration axis. By a rigorous theoretical analysis, properties that can drive the tracking error to be uniformly bounded in the iteration axis are established for the proposed control protocol with the goal of achieving optimal control. The effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed control protocol have been validated through numerical simulations and two comparative examples on general high -frequency signal tracking.					孟, 波/AAO-7058-2020; Wang, Zhen/AAF-8133-2019	Xu, Ke Chao/0009-0002-2716-186X; Wang, Zhen/0000-0001-7188-5828; Meng, Bo/0000-0001-6894-4479													0957-4174	1873-6793				AUG 15	2024	248								123339	10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123339		FEB 2024											WOS:001177511500001

A continuous positioning method is proposed based on an improved neural network with the available sensor data. Firstly, the continuous positioning framework is built to synthesize the traditional GPS/INS coupling mode with the novel estimation method of the improved neural network. Secondly, a reconstructed model of the recurrent auto-regressive neural network is proposed with dual-loop structures, which can excavate the time-series features and the nonlinear relation in multiple sensor measurements. Thirdly, the continuous inertial positioning algorithm is designed based on the novel network, in which the alignment of measurement data is studied to form the augmented inputs. Finally, different experiments are designed and conducted to verify the method, including the outage performance, estimation duration, and model comparison. The results show that positioning estimation precision is relatively high, and the estimation duration reaches an acceptable degree. The proposed method is feasible and effective for positioning in GPS outages.

The model is composed of heterogeneous nonlinear nodes. Moreover, the uncertainties in node dynamics, external disturbances, couplings, and outputs, which cannot be dealt with in one way, are all considered. Based on the uncertain output, asynchronous pinning event-triggered control (ETC) is designed. Since classical Kalman filtering method is not applicable, novel techniques are developed to overcome the difficulties induced by the nonlinear functions, time delays, as well as the multiple uncertainties to derive exponential H-infinity stabilization conditions. It is interesting that all the parameters of the filter can be designed though the nonlinear nodes are heterogeneous and only partial nodes are controlled. The merits of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated by numerical simulations.

That's why there is a vital need to develop a comprehensive model for optimally managing blood networks considering all challenges they face with. Although many researches have studied blood inventory management (BIM) in BSCNs, there is still a lack of models simultaneously considering blood inventory levels in hospital blood banks (HBBs) and blood centers (BCs) as a stochastic pro-cess. Also, most models have not evaluated the impact of false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) errors in the screening laboratories (SLs) of BCs. Moreover, no study has modeled the HBB demands as a queueing-inventory model with multiple blood types according to ABO/Rh substitution priority. To fill these gaps, this paper de-velops a two-echelon blood bank network considering ABO/Rh factors and substitution priority in which in-ventory levels of all red blood cell (RBC) types in an HBB and BC are simultaneously modeled as eight dependent continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). An unobservable M/M/m queueing-inventory system with infected RBCs and (r, Q) policy in the HBB is proposed. The blood requests arrive at the requests queueing system in the HBB, and after processing and departing from the queue, they leave the HBB with exactly-one RBC unit with the same ABO and Rh (Rhesus) groups or compatible with other types of RBC. Lost sales occur if all possible types of RBC for transfusion are unavailable. HBB continuously checks each RBC type's inventory level and places an order to the BC once the inventory level of each one of them reaches a predetermined reorder point. Due to transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs), an SL conducts a 100 % quality-assured screening in the BC modeled as an M/M/m queueing system. Due to unreliable inspectors, FP and FN errors are considered in the SL. The stationary distribution of the number of requests at the HBB, the number of RBCs in the SL, and joint stationary distributions of inventory level of all RBC types in the HBB and BC are derived. Afterward, each RBC type's waiting-time distribution in the HBB is obtained. Some performance measures and the long-run total cost are extended, and a mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is presented. Then, we propose the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) to solve the complicated model. Also, this model is implemented in a case study in Tehran. Results show RBCs types O+ and A+ have the most lost sales, and the management should absorb more donors with these blood groups. Afterward, an approximation method to deal with multiple HBBs is suggested. Finally, several remarkable managerial and practical implications are presented.

However, there are still millions of children in low and middle-income countries who are not covered by routine vaccines and remain at risk. The World Health Organization - Expanded Programme on Immunization (WHO-EPI) was designed to provide universal childhood vaccine access for children across the world and in this work, we address the design of the distribution network for WHO-EPI vaccines. In particular, we formulate the network design problem as a mixed integer program (MIP) and present a new algorithm for typical problems that are too large to be solved using commercial MIP software. We test the algorithm using data derived from four different countries in sub-Saharan Africa and show that the algorithm is able to obtain high-quality solutions for even the largest problems within a few minutes.

A mathematical programming model is proposed for this problem whose objective is to minimize the safety hazard for pedestrians and the total transportation cost of the network. We utilize a customized greedy heuristic and a simulated annealing algorithm for solving the problem. The computational results indicate that installing sidewalks and crosswalks at proper locations can reduce the overall transportation cost and improve pedestrians' safety. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Corridor network design in hinterland transportation systems	FLEXIBLE SERVICES AND MANUFACTURING JOURNAL												In this paper the design of the service network in intermodal barge transport is studied. The network of inland barge terminals is modelled to demonstrate potential cooperations in a corridor network. Cooperation between inland terminals leads to bundling of freight flows in the hinterland of major ports. A service network design model for intermodal barge transport is developed and applied to the hinterland network of the port of Antwerp in Belgium. Selected cooperation schemes are simulated by means of a discrete event simulation model for intermodal barge transport and compared with simulation results of bundling in the port area. Cooperation between inland terminals offers an opportunity to attain economies of scale, but may not be perceived as a sole solution for reducing waiting times of inland barges at sea terminals. A combination of bundling measures in the port area and in the hinterland may be necessary to improve the intermodal transport chain.

J	Wang, HJ; Shi, P; Zhang, JH				Wang, Huijiao; Shi, Peng; Zhang, Jianhua			Event-triggered fuzzy filtering for a class of nonlinear networked control systems	SIGNAL PROCESSING												The problem of event-triggered fuzzy filtering is investigated for a class of nonlinear networked control systems in this paper. The nonlinear networked control system is modeled as a T-S fuzzy system and a discrete event-triggered communication scheme is proposed to mitigate the utility of limited network bandwidth. A logic zero order holder is employed to choose the latest transmitted data packet and discard the disordering packet. Using time-delay system method - the discrete event-triggered communication scheme, the network-induced delay and the nonlinear system are unified into a networked T-S fuzzy time-delay system. Then, a new bounded real lemma is derived for this system based on a reciprocally convex approach. A new co-design method is developed for the triggering condition and the fuzzy filter, which guarantees the correspondent filtering error system being asymptotically stable with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level. Finally two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed results. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, RQ; Chen, LN; Aihara, K				Wang, Ruiqi; Chen, Luonan; Aihara, Kazuyuki			Construction of genetic oscillators with interlocked feedback networks	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												To understand how a gene regulatory network functioning as an oscillator is built, a precise mathematical description of the network and its dynamical properties are developed in this paper. Our approach is based on analyzing the effect of interactions between smaller subnetworks with simple dynamics. We relate an oscillatory behavior of the network to the destabilization phenomenon of a steady state caused by the interactions in a simple discrete map. When source of the instability of the steady state rather than the oscillatory behavior itself is considered, linear stability analysis and feedback control theory can be employed. Moreover, the amplitudes robust against change in delay can also be obtained from the discrete map. The main ideas are illustrated by constructing a genetic oscillator termed a "repressilator" and analyzing the occurrence of cellular rhythms, although the theoretical results hold for a general class of biological systems. The method can be directly applied to design, construct genetic oscillators, and further control their dynamics, even for large-scale networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The packet dropout is assumed to be existing in the sensor-to-controller link, and two independent Bernoulli distributed white sequences are used to describe the packet dropouts. H-infinity filtering of this class of systems is used to design a filter to ensure the mean-square stability of the filtering error system and to guarantee a prescribed H-infinity filtering performance.

The main issue is to design an H-infinity saturated controller such that the controlled close-loop system is exponentially mean-square stable with a desired H-infinity performance. A matrix exponential which is different from some existing literature is used to reconstruct the discrete-time stochastic system to an equivalent yet tractable augmented model without any additional conditional constraint. In virtue of reduced-order confluent Vandermonde matrix approach and Kronecker product operation, the stability condition in terms of linear matrix inequality is derived and then the desired H-infinity saturated controller is designed. It should be emphasized that the improved method can also be used for the stability analysis and controller design when the system matrix contains complex roots. Finally, two numerical examples and a three-axis milling machine system are utilized to manifest the reliability and practicality of the designed strategy.					liu, qi/KFA-4047-2024; Zhao, ZiHao/KHT-4413-2024														1049-8923	1099-1239				APR	2024	34	6					3798	3811		10.1002/rnc.7163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rnc.7163		JAN 2024											WOS:001135661300001

Firstly, the cascade control structure divides the ball and beam model into two lower order discrete time models and according to the two discrete time models design the inner closed loop controller and the outer closed loop controller. Furthermore, this control scheme can deal with problems that other control methods can hardly achieve satisfied control performance due to the actuator dynamics of the ball and beam system. In addition, for the inner closed loop controller, radial basis function (RBF) network is integrated to compensate the nonlinearity in addition to traditional PD control. Finally, the proposed control strategy is based on discrete time and can easily be applied to industrial application. Experimental results demonstrate that the addressed control strategy can easily be implemented and achieve perfect control precision.

The existence of common cause failures (CCFs) has a significant impact on system reliability. A reliability analysis model is proposed for dynamic systems with CCFs based on discrete-time Bayesian networks (DTBNs). The system operating time is dispersed into several time intervals, and the component failures are divided into independent and CCF states. Dynamic systems with cold and warm spare parts are examined to determine the modelling methodology and conditional probability tables (CPTs) of Bayesian network (BN) nodes. The reliability calculation is realised through the Bayesian inference mechanism.

At the upper level problem, planner makes investment decision in links and hubs of a comprehensive transportation system to minimize the total times costs plus investment costs and the external costs such as environment pollution, land use and energy exhaustion. At the lower level, users choose their paths in accordance with deterministic user equilibrium. We design an algorithm based on extremal optimization to solve the upper level problem, in which only investments on those links and hubs with high marginal cost are updated randomly at each step to combine the merits of gradient-based methods and intelligent heuristics. Numerical comparison was made on a grid network with 9 nodes and 14 links. The result shows that the algorithm is competitive with gradient-based and simulated annealing methods.

The basic elements of the proposed sorting structures are simple relational nodes for analogue signals from sensor devices and cameras. Such elements can be implemented on a different element basis, including, on devices for selecting a maximum or minimum of two analog or digital signals, which are implemented, in one of the variants, on CMOS current mirrors and carry out the function of continuous logic limited difference. We offer optoelectronic implementation of such basic relational element and a homogeneous sorting structure on such elements, consisting of two layers and a multichannel sampling and holding device. Nine signals corresponding to a selection window of a matrix sensor are fed to this structure, we sort them in five iterative steps, and at the output we receive the signals sorted by the rank, which, using the code controlled programmable multiplexer, generates an output signal, corresponding to the selected rank. We evaluate the technical parameters of such a relational preprocessor for nonlinear signal processing in image processors, sorting networks, multichannel parallel type sensor, processing, and encoding systems. The base cells consist of no more than 20 CMOS 1.5 mu m transistors, the total power consumption of the sorting node on 10 continuously logical base cells (CL BC) is 2mW, the supply voltage is 1.8 divided by 3.3V, the range of an input photocurrent is 0.1 divided by 24 mu A, the conversion cycle is 10 mu s, but can be improved by selecting other transistors and some modifications of the circuits. Such mixed analog processor is modeled in PSpice OrCad. The paper considers results of design and modeling of CL BC based on photosensitive cells with an extended electronic circuit and current mirrors (CM) with functions of preliminary subsequent analogue processing for creating picture type image processors (IP) with matrix parallel inputs-outputs. Such BCs and sorting nodes based on them have a number of advantages: high speed and reliability, simplicity, small power consumption, high integration level. We consider CL BC for methods of selection and rank preprocessing. In contrast to our previous works here we will dwell more on analogue preprocessing schemes for signals of neighboring cells. Let us show how the introduction of iterative sorting nodes extends the range of functions performed by the IPs. Examples of image processing with proposed preprocessor are simulated in MathCad and show the field of application of such coprocessors and new prospects for realization of linear and matrix photo-electronic structures with matrix operands. The essential difference is that the structure is iterative and allows to significantly reducing hardware costs in comparison with other hardware implementations of sorting networks. We discuss some aspects of possible rules and principles of learning and programmable configuration for the required function, relational work, and the implementation of hardware blocks for modifying such processors.

These include a wide range of network design and connectivity augmentation and orientation problems, as well as some results on colourings and matchings. In the first part of the paper we survey results that follow from the totally dual integral (TDI) property of various systems defined by supermodular-type set functions. One of the aims of the survey is to emphasize the importance of relaxing the supermodularity property to include a wider range of set functions. We show how these relaxations lead to it unified understanding of different types of applications. The second part is devoted to results that, according to our current knowledge, cannot be explained using total dual integrality. We would like to demonstrate that an extensive theory independent of total dual integrality has been developed in the last 15 years, centered around various connectivity augmentation problems. Our survey concentrates on the theoretical foundations, and does not include every detail on applications, since the majority of these applications are described in detail in another survey paper by the first author (Frank 2006). The comprehensive book "Combinatorial Optitnization: Polyhedra and Efficiency" by Schrijver (2003) is also a rich resource of results related to submodular functions. It should be noted that sub- and supermodularity have several applications in areas riot discussed in this paper. In particular, we should mention the book "Submodular Functions and Optimization" by Fujishige (2005) and the book "Discrete Convex Analysis" by Murota (2003).

A matching network that leads to an easy amplifier design for microstrip implementation will be described. With this network we can vary the fundamental and the second harmonic load impedance of the amplifier independently. With this circuit, significant improvements in the performance of a class C power amplifier were achieved by presenting proper values of second harmonic reactive load at the output of the transistor.

It has attracted extensive attention due to its self-folding mechanism, shape-morphing capability, and deployable structures. This article develops network-based methods for designing and controlling a three-dimensional (3D) triangulated origami tessellation to approximate multiple surfaces. The desired surfaces are represented by sets of discrete nodes and the origami tessellation to be designed is composed of triangles. Then, the tessellation design problem is formulated as an optimization problem of minimizing the distance between the origami triangle vertices and the discrete nodes subject to developability and rigid-foldability constraints. Solving the resulting optimization problem leads to an origami tessellation with folding states associated with each target surface. To achieve transformation between different shapes, we first leverage graph rigidity theory to define every 3D origami shape uniquely up to translations and rotations. Next, in order to minimize the control efforts, the shape transformation control problem is formulated as an optimal control problem subject to the derived rigidity conditions, whose feasibility is guaranteed by transformability of the origami and controllability of dynamic vertices. Finally, simulation examples for surface approximation are provided to verify the effectiveness of the network-based design and control methods.

J	Han, SS; Kim, HK				Han, Seong-Sik; Kim, Heung-Kyu			Artificial neural network-based sequential approximate optimization of metal sheet architecture and forming process	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING												This paper introduces a sequential approximate optimization method that combines the finite element method (FEM), dynamic differential evolution (DDE), and artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate models. The developed method is applied to address two optimization problems. The first involves metamaterial design optimization for metal sheet architecture with binary design variables. The second pertains to optimizing process parameters in multi-stage metal forming, where the discrete nature arises owing to changing tool geometries across stages. This process is highly non-linear, accumulating contact, geometric, and material non-linear effects discretely through forming stages. The efficacy of the proposed optimization method, utilizing ANN surrogate models, is compared with traditionally used polynomial response surface (PRS) surrogate models, primarily based on low-order polynomials. Efficient learning of ANN surrogate models is facilitated through the FEM and Python integration framework. Initial data for surrogate model training are collected via Latin hypercube sampling and FEM simulations. DDE is employed for sequential approximate optimization, optimizing ANN or PRS surrogate models to determine optimal design variables. PRS surrogate models encounter challenges in dealing with non-linear changes in sequential approximate optimization concerning discrete characteristics such as binary design variables and discrete non-linear behavior found in multi-stage metal forming processes. Owing to the discrete nature, PRS surrogate models require more data and iterations for optimal design variables. In contrast, ANN surrogate models adeptly predict non-linear behavior through the activation function's characteristics. In the optimization problem of metal sheet architecture for design Target C, the ANN surrogate model required an average of 4.6 times fewer iterations to satisfy stopping criteria compared with the PRS surrogate model. Furthermore, in the optimization of multi-stage deep drawing processes, the ANN surrogate model required an average of 6.1 times fewer iterations to satisfy stopping criteria compared with the PRS surrogate model. As a result, the sequential global optimization method utilizing ANN surrogate models achieves optimal design variables with fewer iterations than PRS surrogate models. Further confirmation of the method's efficiency is provided by comparing Pearson correlation coefficients and locus plots.

In general, MILP formulations are intractable even for relatively small networks due to the combinatorial complexity of the problem. In this paper we propose improvements to these models and a method to solve the LTD and the LR problems in a combined manner. The interest is two fold: firstly, by tackling the two problems with separate models, problem instances of realistic size (up to 14 nodes in this paper) can be dealt with. Furthermore, different combinations of optimization models and objective functions can be investigated in a modular manner. Secondly, the mechanisms proposed to combine the problems allow to keep track of the global design problem when solving each individual step.																			1387-974X					JUL-DEC	2002	4	3-4					443	456		10.1023/A:1016036619474	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016036619474													WOS:000176480400015

Exploring Feasible Design Space for Multi-Octave Power Amplifier Using Nonlinear Embedding	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS												This brief presents a design space analysis for optimum load trajectory selection in multi-octave continuous class power amplifiers using nonlinear embedding model. The proposed approach solves the major problem associated with the synthesis of a broadband matching network due to the non-foster behavior of load at the device package terminal. The nonlinear embedding model allows the designer direct access at the current generator plane for applying any load apparently creating desired waveforms for any class of operations.

Performance modeling and analysis of network firewalls help to better understand their behavior and characteristics. Moreover, having an analytical model in hand helps firewall designers avoid developing multiple design alternatives and thus considerably reduce the design costs. Moreover, the network administrators can proactively identify the performance bottlenecks of the network and fix them before any malicious attack which targets the network or the firewall itself. In this paper, we propose a novel analytical approach for performance modeling and analysis of network firewalls based on a discrete-time queuing system in which the bursty nature of the incoming traffic is taken into account, where traditional queuing models such as M/M/1 model fails to capture peculiar characteristics of the Internet traffic. Throughput, packet loss, delay, and firewalls CPU utilization are employed as performance evaluation indicators in our proposed model. In addition, we introduce a potential DoS attack with a very low rate which can be launched against firewalls with different burstiness factors.					elbiaze, halima/ABD-2963-2021	elbiaze, halima/0000-0001-5681-6445; Shahsavari, Yahya/0000-0003-3223-1260													2169-3536						2019	7						183311	183321		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926925	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926925													WOS:000509527200042

The redundant channel is considered to overcome the fragility of networks configured by a single channel in the communication networks. The considered switching law is of mode-dependent persistent dwell time characteristic, which is more general than the widely-used average dwell time and dwell time switching properties. The desired fault detection filters are designed, and the globally asymptotic stability of the augmented system is analyzed using the quasi-time-dependent Lyapunov function approach. The explicit solution of the fault detection filters is obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. A practical application on the boost converter is illustrated to show the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.

A discrete dynamic system is firstly described to mimic train rescheduling, and a state transition function is specially designed according to the train departure event. The purpose of this function is to improve simulation efficiency by directly confirming the next discrete time. After the construction and analysis of optimization models to discrete dynamic system, a two-stage heuristic search strategy is developed, by using clustering hierarchy theory and stochastic search strategy, to obtain train departure time and arrival time before each state transition of the system. Finally, a numerical experiment is conducted to verify the proposed system, models, and the heuristic search strategy. The result shows that the discrete dynamic system, together with the state transition function and heuristic search strategy, shows better performance in simulation efficiency and solution quality.

To preserve user anonymity against traffic analysis attacks, the emerging mix networks mess up the order of packets through a set of centralized and explicit shuffling nodes. However, this centralized design of mix networks is insecure against targeted DoS attacks that can completely block these shuffling nodes. In this article, we present DAENet, an efficient mix network that resists both targeted DoS attacks and traffic analysis attacks with a new abstraction called Stealthy Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network. The stealthy P2P network effectively hides the shuffling nodes used in a routing path into the whole network, such that adversaries cannot distinguish specific shuffling nodes and conduct targeted DoS attacks to block these nodes. In addition, to handle traffic analysis attacks, we leverage the confidentiality and integrity protection of Intel SGX to ensure trustworthy packet shuffles at each distributed host and use multiple routing paths to prevent adversaries from tracking and revealing user identities. We show that our system is scalable with moderate latency (2.2s) when running in a cluster of 10,000 participants and is robust in the case of machine failures, making it an attractive new design for decentralized anonymous communication.

Tubes with smooth (S), rough (R), or alternating smooth-rough (S/R) or rough-smooth (R/S) inner surfaces but with identical chemical composition and permeability characteristics were used to bridge a 4-mm nerve gap in a transected mouse sciatic nerve. Animals received S and R channels for 1,2 and 4 weeks and both S/R and R/S channels for 2 and 4 weeks. At 1 week, the S tubes contained a longitudinally oriented fibrin matrix not contacting the channel''s smooth inner wall, whereas R tubes featured an unorganized fibrin matrix which, together with fibroblasts and macrophages, had invaded the channel''s rough trabecular network. After 4 weeks, S tubes contained discrete, free-floating nerve cables with numerous myelinated and unmyelinated axons surrounded by a thin, continuous epineurial-like layer, whereas R tubes were completely filled with a loose connective tissue stroma with only a few axons. In combined S/R or R/S channels, the general morphological patterns in individual S or R segments were similar to those observed in pure S or R channels, regardless of whether the tube segment was positioned at the proximal or distal nerve end. Proximal smooth channel segments contained discrete cables which abruptly fanned out to completely fill the lumen in distal rough segments. The opposite pattern was observed with proximal rough and distal smooth segments. At 4 weeks, myelinated axons were observed along the entire length of S/R and R/S tubes. These results suggest that the surface microgeometry of guidance channels influences the outcome of peripheral nerve regeneration, potentially by affecting the early arrangement of the fibrin matrix and/or inducing different cellular responses.

The results showed that with reasonable network settings, the fitting of the model training was good, and the prediction results were satisfactory. The mean relative error of prediction results was 3.16%, and the correlation coefficient was 0.974. Therefore, it is possible to use an artificial neural network to set up a compressive strength prediction model for seawater sea sand concrete.

A Partial-Nodes-Based Information fusion approach to state estimation for discrete-Time delayed stochastic complex networks	INFORMATION FUSION												This paper is concerned with the information-fusion-based state estimation problem for a class of discrete-time complex networks with time-varying delays and stochastic perturbations. The measurement outputs available for state estimation are from a fraction of network nodes, and the addressed problem is therefore referred to as the so-called Partial-Nodes-Based (PNB) state estimation problem. By employing the Lyapunov stability theory, a novel framework is established to cope with the PNB state estimation problem by the measurement outputs collected from partial network nodes. By constructing specific Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, sufficient criteria are derived for the existence of the desired exponentially ultimately bounded state estimator in mean square for the complex networks. Moreover, a special case is considered where the complex network under investigation is free of stochastic perturbations and the corresponding analysis issue is discussed to ensure the existence of an exponential state estimator. In addition, the explicit expressions of the gains of the desired estimators are characterized. Finally, a numerical illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

Asphalt mix design follows the standard procedure (Marshall procedure). We were interested not only in the quantity of bitumen specified by the Marshall procedure, but also in the quantity of stone aggregate fractions, temperatures of production and properties of bitumen that is used. The influence of these factors was investigated with several models. For the building of models we used 444 asphalt samples, analysed by one laboratory. To select the most important factors, several multiple linear regression (MLR) models, partial least squares (PLS) regression models and counterpropagation neural network models were made. Obtained models were tested with leave-one-out (LOO) and leave-10%-out cross-validation procedures. The results of MLR and PLS models show that the independent variables are closely related. Among 21 variables there is only one found as less important. MLR and PLS models show better predictive ability than counterpropagation neural network models. The best MLR models will be employed for the preparation of the asphalt mix design (recipe) with some unknown material. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Giotopoulos, V; Korres, G				Giotopoulos, Vasilis; Korres, Georgios			Implementation of Phasor Measurement Unit Based on Phase-Locked Loop Techniques: A Comprehensive Review	ENERGIES												The dynamic monitoring, control, and protection of modern power systems in real time require time-stamped electrical measurements to accurately estimate the bus voltage phasors using the state estimation function under normal and abnormal conditions. These measurements can be acquired by time-synchronized devices, known as phasor measurement units (PMUs). PMUs can measure bus voltage and branch current phasors of a three-phase network, as well as the frequency and the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF), with high speed, accuracy and time stamping provided by global positioning system (GPS) at the coordinated universal time (UTC). Various phasor estimation algorithms have been proposed in the literature, while most of them are concentrated in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm, where an integer number of samples multiple of the nominal frequency is required for the computations. In cases where the frequency of the power grid deviates from its nominal value, the raw application of the DFT approach can lead to large errors during phasor estimation. Another approach of the phasor estimation is based on the phase-locked loop (PLL) techniques, widely used in grid tie inverters. PLL techniques can track dynamically (continuous time) the estimated frequency to the time-variant frequency of the power grid. A brief introduction to the basic concepts of the synchrophasor definition is provided, while the main DFT methods for synchrophasor estimation according to recent literature are mentioned. PLL-based PMU techniques are reviewed for both steady-state and dynamic conditions according to IEEE standards. In conclusion, the performance of PLL-based PMU algorithms presented in this literature review is discussed.

The interaction protocols are necessary to define the sequential state and the state transition mechanisms which are the core of the DEVS-based agent model introduced by the authors.

Ideally, the new situation is autonomously assessed and the vehicle's behavior is adapted accordingly. Modern mission-critical vehicles realize a network-centric design approach, for one reason because it follows the inherent requirements of interconnecting the sensors and actuators of a control system and secondly, to tolerate a partial failure of the system. Therefore, in order to construct a truly adaptive system, the underlying network infrastructure must harmonically interplay with the top-level adaptive decisions. TTEthernet is such a COTS network infrastructure supporting network-centric system design that provides built-in integrity and redundancy management mechanisms as well as sharing the same physical network for applications of mixed criticality. This paper discusses adaptable QoS and adaptable protocol-control flow in general and in particular using TTEthernet as case study.

The control concept consists of a buffering mechanism and a discrete time integral sliding mode based control law. This setting offers the possibility to use discrete-time sliding mode control techniques designed for relative degree one systems. As a consequence, networked control algorithms can be developed based on recent results from this active field of research. Using a discretized version of the super twisting algorithm, which is obtained by the so-called matching approach, increases the accuracy due to the absence of discretization chattering. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated by means of laboratory experiments. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we have developed a novel method to estimate missing observation in geostatistics by using sigma-delta modulation type of Discrete-Time Cellular Neural Networks(DT-CNN). The nearest neighboring pixels of missing values in an image are used. The interpolation process is done by using B-template with Gaussian filter. The DT-CNN is used for reconstructing the imputed values from analog image value to digital image value. We have evaluated this approach through the experiments on geostatistics image which has different characteristics of missing pixels such as Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off and standard geostatistics image. The experimental results show that by using sigma-delta modulation type of Discrete-Time Cellular Neural Networks, we can achieve a high PSNR for various image datasets and at different characteristics of missing image.

J	An, Y; Huang, CC				An, Yang; Huang, Changcheng			A high-throughput energy-efficient passive optical datacenter network	PHOTONIC NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS												Datacenter applications impose heavy demands on bandwidth and also generate a variety of communication patterns (unicast, multicast, incast, and broadcast). Supporting such traffic demands leads to networks built with exorbitant facility costs and formidable power consumption if conventional design is followed. In this paper, we propose a novel high-throughput datacenter network that leverages passive optical technologies to efficiently support communications with mixed traffic patterns. Our network enables a dynamic traffic allocation that caters to diverse communication patterns at low power consumption. Specifically, our proposed network consists of two optical planes, each optimized for specific traffic patterns. We compare the proposed network with its optical and electronic counterparts and highlight its potential benefits in terms of facility costs and power consumption reductions. To avoid frame collisions, a high-efficiency distributed protocol is designed to dynamically distribute traffic between the two optical planes. Moreover, we formulate the scheduling process as a mixed integer programming problem and design three greedy heuristic algorithms. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the previous POXN architecture in terms of throughput and mean packet delay.						an, yang/0000-0001-5375-9449													1387-974X	1572-8188				JUN	2017	33	3					258	274		10.1007/s11107-016-0651-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11107-016-0651-2													WOS:000400641700002

The issues of guaranteed cost control for a class of continuous-time networked control systems with data drift are investigated. Firstly, with the consideration of data drift between sensor and controller, a closed-loop model of networked control systems including network factors such as time-delay and data-dropouts is established. And then, selecting an appropriate Lyapunov function, a guaranteed cost controller in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) is designed to asymptotically stabilize the networked control system with data drift.

Motivated by this observation, we shall investigate the global pinning synchronization problems for complex switching networks for which the target system is subject to nonzero control inputs. First, using the idea of unit vector function method, a discontinuous coupling law is designed. With the aid of stability theory for switched systems, it is theoretically shown that synchronization in the network under this discontinuous coupling law can be achieved by choosing sufficiently large coupling strengths if the average dwell time (ADT) is bounded below by a positive constant. Second, we use the boundary layer method to design a continuous-coupling law. It has been theoretically shown that the synchronization error is ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB) under this continuous-coupling law. The chattering effect is also avoided in real implementation by using this continuous-coupling law. Furthermore, for networks with unknown external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, neuro-adaptive-based coupling laws are designed to ensure that the synchronization error of the networks with undirected switching communication topologies under these laws is UUB. The obtained theoretical results are finally validated by performing numerical simulation on coupling Chua's circuit systems.

The TS-KRR strategy approximates the unknown nonlinear systems by learning the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy parameters from the input-output data. Two main steps are required to construct the TS-KRR: the first step is to use a clustering algorithm such as the clustering based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm that separates the input data into clusters and obtains the antecedent TS fuzzy model parameters. In the second step, the consequent TS fuzzy parameters are obtained using a Kernel ridge regression algorithm. Furthermore, the TS based predictive control is created by integrating the TS-KRR into the Generalized Predictive Controller. Next, an adaptive, online, version of TS-KRR is proposed and integrated with the GPC controller resulting an efficient adaptive fuzzy generalized predictive control methodology that can deal with most of the industrial plants and has the ability to deal with disturbances and variations of the model parameters. In the adaptive TS-KRR algorithm, the antecedent parameters are initialized with a simple K-means algorithm and updated using a simple gradient algorithm. Then, the consequent parameters are obtained using the sliding-window Kernel Recursive Least squares (KRLS) algorithm. Finally, two nonlinear systems: A surge tank and Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) systems were used to investigate the performance of the new adaptive TS-KRR GPC controller. Furthermore, the results obtained by the adaptive TS-KRR GPC controller were compared with two other controllers. The numerical results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed adaptive TS-KRR GPC method for discrete-time nonlinear systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We demonstrate that to design the ILC algorithm, differentiability of the system dynamics is not necessary, and the GLC condition is sufficient for designing the ILC algorithm for stochastic nonlinear networked systems with non-differentiable dynamics. We investigate the analysis of convergence and the tracking performance of the proposed update law for stochastic nonlinear networked systems with GLC condition. We show that there exists no limited condition for the stochastic data dropout probabilities in the convergence investigation of the input error. Then, the results are reviewed and confirmed with a numerical example.																			2071-0216	2308-0256				NOV	2021	14	4					63	73		10.14529/mmp210405	http://dx.doi.org/10.14529/mmp210405													WOS:000727937200005

In order to evaluate immeasurable state variables, a least square evaluation method is adopted. A dynamic surface controller is designed for discrete-time strict-feedback systems. When the transmission time of Sensor-to-Controller (S-C) or Controller-to-Actuator (C-A) channel increases, the stability and dynamic performance of the system deteriorates are improved by the proposed predictive event-triggered control strategy. Furthermore, the proposed methodology decreases the use of network resources while the whole system still keeps stable and exhibits an acceptable dynamic performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is effective.

Adaptive network-fuzzy inferencing to estimate concrete strength using mix design	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING												Proportioning of concrete mixes is carried out in accordance with specified code information, specifications, and past experiences. Typically, concrete mix companies use different mix designs that are used to establish tried and tested datasets. Thus, a model can be developed based on existing datasets to estimate the concrete strength of a given mix proportioning and avoid costly tests and adjustments. Inherent uncertainties encountered in the model can be handled with fuzzy based methods, which are capable of incorporating information obtained from expert knowledge and datasets. In this paper, the use of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inferencing system is proposed to train a fuzzy model and estimate concrete strength. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified using actual concrete mix proportioning datasets reported in the literature, and the corresponding coefficient of determination r(2) range from 0.970-0.999. Further, sensitivity analysis is carried out to highlight the impact of different mix constituents on the estimate concrete strength.

Secure Mobile Commerce in Ad hoc Network Using CAEC<SUP>2</SUP>M	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUTURE GENERATION COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING												M-Commerce applications in the world have grown exponentially over the years. It had set up for mobile users to engage wirelessly of ad hoc network infrastructure in online business irrespective of place or time. Providing anonymous, secure and trust based connection service in ad hoc network is quite a challenging task. Anonymity, security and privacy of the transaction or message transmission are the highest priority need to be delivered to the destination node on time. In this paper, a CAEC(2) M (Cellular Automata Elliptic Curve Cryptography Mix network) algorithm to secure Mobile Commerce over ad hoc network is proposed. An attempt is made to design a mix-network (Mix-Net) using elliptic curve cryptography based on cellular automata which creates a hard to trace communication to protect the anonymity of the sender and encrypt the sensitive information to avoid any eavesdropper trying to access the data during transmission. CAEC 2 M provides also confidentiality, integrity and authentication.

The developed PIO is equipped with more design freedom leading to better steady-state accuracy compared with the conventional Luenberger observer. The phenomena of randomly occurring gain variations, which are characterized by the Bernoulli distributed random variables with certain probabilities, are taken into consideration in the implementation of the addressed PIO. Attention is focused on the design of a nonfragile PIO such that the error dynamics of the state estimation is exponentially stable in a mean-square sense, and the prescribed H-infinity performance index is also achieved. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the desired PIO are established by virtue of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and the matrix inequality technique. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PIO design scheme.

In particular, we consider linear, discrete-time models with a packet-switched communication channel between the sensors and the controller. We assume that the packet-delay and drop-out in the channel can be modeled with independent, identically distributed random processes or Markov chains. With this assumption, we reformulate the problem as a jump system and present both stability conditions and three different controller design algorithms. These results are taken from the literature except for one controller design procedure which is new and has the advantage of giving a fast solution at the expense of higher conservatism. Finally, all design algorithms are illustrated and compared, based on a common simulation example.

This paper deals with a two-echelon supply chain network design problem in deterministic, single-period, multi-commodity contexts. The problem involves both strategic and tactical levels of supply chain planning including locating and sizing manufacturing plants and distribution warehouses, assigning the retailers' demands to the warehouses, and the warehouses to the plants, as well as selecting transportation modes. We have formulated the problem as a mixed integer programming model, which integrates the above mentioned decisions and intends to minimize total costs of the network including transportation, lead-times, and inventory holding costs for products, as well as opening and operating costs for facilities. Moreover, we have developed an efficient Lagrangian based heuristic solution algorithm for solving the real-sized problems in reasonable computational time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Atamtürk, A; Rajan, D				Atamturk, Alper; Rajan, Deepak			Partition inequalities for capacitated survivable network design based on directed p-cycles	DISCRETE OPTIMIZATION												We study the design of capacitated survivable networks using directed p-cycles. A p-cycle is a cycle with at least three arcs, used for rerouting disrupted flow during edge failures. Survivability of the network is accomplished by reserving sufficient slack on directed p-cycles so that if an edge fails, its flow can be rerouted along the p-cycles. We describe a model for designing capacitated survivable networks based on directed p-cycles. We motivate this model by comparing it with other means of ensuring survivability, and present a mixed-integer programming formulation for it. We derive valid inequalities for the model based on the minimum capacity requirement between partitions of the nodes and give facet conditions for them. We discuss the separation for these inequalities and present results of computational experiments for testing their effectiveness as cutting planes when incorporated in a branch-and-cut algorithm. Our experiments show that the proposed inequalities reduce the computational effort significantly. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Because the network-induced delay depends on network traffic condition, it is not a fixed value. Thus, it is required to consider the variable time delay in order to design the optimal controller. In this paper, LMI-based output feedback controller is proposed to compensate the network-induced time delay for networked control system which has time-varying delay in the limited value. First, the effect of time-varying delay is regarded as a variable sampling time in the discrete time system. And, we design the output feedback controller that guarantees the system stability and reduces the steady state error.																					0-7803-8734-1				2004							311	314																WOS:000226849900037

When the reaction is undertaken in DMF, the product is [Zn-3(OAc)(6)(HL1)(4)] 1, in which Zn(OAc)(2) centres link Zn-2(OAc)(4)(HL1)(4) units into double-stranded zig-zag chains. Each chain is 'broken' after every fourth HL1 ligand, though the links between the chains ensure a coordination polymer is formed. The reaction in methanol produces [Zn(OAc)(2)(HL1)]center dot 0.5MeOH 2 which also contains double-stranded chains, though in this case both chains are continuous. The hydrothermal reaction gives [Zn(OAc)(2)(HL1)(2)]center dot H2O 3, which contains discrete zinc complex molecules that are linked into double-stranded chains through hydrogen bonds. Zinc(II) chloride reacts with HL1 to form [ZnCl2(L-1)] 4. The structure of 4 consists of chains that are cross-linked into sheets by N-H center dot center dot center dot Cl hydrogen bonds.

The size of this contribution depends on the acceptance of this new technology in the market. This paper reports on the design and results of an elaborate stated choice experiment to investigate the effects of vehicle attributes, contextual and social network attributes on the latent demand for electric cars. The study contributes to the existing literature primarily by explicitly modelling the effects of different elements of social networks on the latent demand for electric cars. Moreover, the number of attributes included in the study design exceeds the typical number of attributes used in previous research, making the model more sensitive to a larger spectrum of variables. Two different mixed logit models are estimated: one with random parameters for vehicle attributes and contextual attributes and fixed effects for the social network attributes; one with random effects for social network attributes and fixed effects for the remaining attributes. Results indicate substantive differences between these two models in terms of the shape of utility curves. Overall, vehicle attributes are most important in the choice of electric cars, followed by social influence attributes. The effects of social network are relatively small.						rasouli, soora/0000-0001-8044-8654													1566-113X	1572-9427				MAR	2016	16	1					99	130		10.1007/s11067-013-9194-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11067-013-9194-6													WOS:000373627700006

In this work, we investigate the joint design of beam selection and digital precoding matrices for mmWave MU-MIMO systems with DLA to maximize the sum-rate subject to the transmit power constraint and the constraints of the selection matrix structure. The investigated non-convex problem with discrete variables and coupled constraints is challenging to solve and an efficient framework of joint neural network (NN) design is proposed to tackle it. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based NN and a deep-unfolding NN, which are employed to optimize the beam selection and digital precoding matrices, respectively. As for the DRL-based NN, we formulate the beam selection problem as a Markov decision process and a double deep Q-network algorithm is developed to solve it. The base station is considered to be an agent, where the state, action, and reward function are carefully designed. Regarding the design of the digital precoding matrix, we develop an iterative weighted minimum mean-square error algorithm induced deep-unfolding NN, which unfolds this algorithm into a layer-wise structure with introduced trainable parameters. Simulation results verify that this jointly trained NN remarkably outperforms the existing iterative algorithms with reduced complexity and stronger robustness.

Comprehensive methodology to monitor longitudinal change patterns during EHR implementations: a case study at a large health care delivery network	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS												Objective: To test a systematic methodology to monitor longitudinal change patterns on quality, productivity, and safety outcomes during a large-scale commercial Electronic Health Record (EHR) implementation. Materials and Methods: Our method combines an interrupted time-series design with control sites and 41 consensus outcomes including quality (11 measures), productivity (20 measures), and safety (10 measures). The intervention consisted of a phased commercial EHR implementation at a large health care delivery network. Four medium-size hospitals and 39 clinics from 5 geographic regions implementing the new EHR were compared against a parallel control consisting of one medium-size and one large hospital and 10 clinics that had not implemented the new EHR at the time of this study. We collected monthly data from February 2013 to July 2017. Results: The proposed methodology was successfully implemented and significant changes were observed in most measured variables. A significant change attributable to the intervention was observed in 12 (29%) measures in three or more regions; in 32 (78%) measures in two or more regions; and in 40 (98%) measures in at least one region. A similar pattern (i.e., same impact in three or more regions) was detected for nine (22%) measures, a mixed pattern (i.e., same impact in two regions, and different impact in other regions) was detected for nine (22%) measures, and an inconsistent pattern (i.e., did not detect the same impact across regions) was detected for 23 (56%) measures. Discussion: Using a formal methodology to assess changes in a set of consensus measures, we detected various patterns of impact and mixed time-sensitive effects. With an increasing adoption of EHR systems, it is critical for health care organizations to systematically monitor their EHR implementations. The proposed method provides a robust and consistent approach to monitor EHR implementations longitudinally allowing for continuous monitoring after the system becomes stable in order to avoid unexpected effects. Conclusion: Our results and methodology can guide the broader medical and informatics communities by informing what and how to continuously monitor EHR impact on quality, productivity, and safety.					, Julio/JDM-4514-2023	Colicchio, Tiago/0000-0003-3405-1538; facelli, julio/0000-0003-1449-477X; Scammon, Debra/0000-0002-8212-3076; Del Fiol, Guilherme/0000-0001-9954-6799													1532-0464	1532-0480				JUL	2018	83						40	53		10.1016/j.jbi.2018.05.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2018.05.018								29857137					WOS:000445054700005

J	Moosavian, N; Lence, B				Moosavian, Naser; Lence, Barbara			Testing evolutionary algorithms for optimization of water distribution networks	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												Water distribution networks (WDNs) are one of the most important elements of urban infrastructure and require large investment for construction. Design of WDNs is classified as a large combinatorial discrete nonlinear optimization problem. The main concerns associated with the optimization of such networks are the nonlinearity of the discharge-head loss relationships for pipes and the discrete nature of pipe sizes. Due to these issues, this problem is widely considered to be a benchmark problem for testing and evaluating the performance of nonlinear and heuristic optimization algorithms. This paper compares different techniques, all based on evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which yield optimal solutions for least-cost design of WDNs. All of these algorithms search for the global optimum starting from populations of solutions, rather than from a single solution, as in Newton-based search methods. They use different operators to improve the performance of many solutions over repeated iterations. Ten EAs, four of them for the first time, are applied to the design of three networks and their performance in terms of the least cost, under different stopping criteria, are evaluated. Statistical information for 20 executions of the ten algorithms is summarized, and Friedman tests are conducted. Results show that, for the two-loop benchmark network, the particle swarm optimization gravitational search and biology and bioinformatics global optimization algorithms efficiently converge to the global optimum, but perform poorly for large networks. In contrast, given a sufficient number of function evaluations, the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and soccer league competition algorithm consistently converge to the global optimum, for large networks.																			0315-1468	1208-6029				MAY	2019	46	5					391	402		10.1139/cjce-2018-0137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjce-2018-0137													WOS:000466874200006

The main purpose is to calculate and complete the system state information through the significant measurement outputs. Firstly, the original nonlinear error system is translated into a linearly uncertain one by applying the Lagrange's Mean-Value Theorem. Secondly, a sufficient condition is established to ensure the robust asymptotic stability of error system by resorting to Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, convex combination technique, Jensen's inequality, linear matrix inequality combined with Barbalat's lemma. Meantime, the state observer gains are derived in term of the feasible solutions to inequalities.

J	Zhang, YN; Qi, ZY; Yang, M; Guo, JJ; Huang, HC				Zhang, Yunong; Qi, Zhiyuan; Yang, Min; Guo, Jinjin; Huang, Huanchang			Step-width theoretics and numerics of four-point general DTZN model for future minimization using Jury stability criterion	NEUROCOMPUTING												Future minimization, or say, discrete-time time-varying minimization, can be successfully solved by discrete-time Zhang neuronet (DTZN) models. A DTZN model is obtained through the discretization of a continuous-time Zhang neuronet (CTZN) model. However, most of the existing numerical differentiation formulas cannot be applied to discretizing a CTZN model for obtaining an effective DTZN model. Zhang et al discretization (ZeaD) formulas are the ones that can successfully address the problem about discretization. Recently, the four-point general ZeaD formula has been proposed (Hu et al., 2018), which can be applied to obtaining the four-point general DTZN model for future minimization. This paper focuses on researching the step-width-related stability of the four-point general DTZN model for future minimization. The step-width is a crucial parameter in the DTZN model. If the step-width is out of its corresponding interval, DTZN model does not converge in terms of residual error and fails in solving future minimization problem. By using Jury stability criterion, the analytic solution of step-width interval is proposed corresponding to the four-point general DTZN model. In addition, the optimal value of step-width is investigated, and the analytic solution of the optimal value is proposed as well. When step-width is equal to the optimal value, DTZN model has the fastest convergence rate to steady state with respect to residual error, and is farthest from instable state, thus having the best stability. The theoretical analyses are consistent with previous special-case investigations, and their correctness is confirmed by numerical experiments and results (i.e., numerics). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The issue and challenge related to enterprises networks design are more and more critical. These networks are often designed for short terms since their strategies must be competitive and better adapted to the environment, social and economical changes. As a solution, to design a flexible and robust network, it is necessary to deal with the trade-off between conflicting qualitative and quantitative criteria such as cost, quality, delivery time, and competition, etc. To this end, using Big Data (BD) as emerging technology will enhance the real performances of these kinds of networks. Moreover, even if the literature is rich with BD models and frameworks developed for a single supply chain network (SCN), there is a real need to scale and extend these BD models to networked supply chains (NSCs). To do so, this paper proposes a BD architecture to drive a mixed-network of SCs that collaborate in serial and parallel fashions. The collaboration is set up by sharing their resources, capabilities, competencies, and information to imitate a unique organisation. The objective is to increase internal value to their shareholders (where value is seen as wealth) and deliver better external value to the end-customer (where value represents customer satisfaction). Within a mixed-network of SCs, both values are formally calculated considering both serial and parallel networks configurations. Besides, some performance factors of the proposed BD architecture such as security, flexibility, robustness and resilience are discussed.

Distributed time synchronization in wireless sensor networks with coupled discrete-time oscillators	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING												In wireless sensor networks, distributed timing synchronization based on pulse-coupled oscillators at the physical layer is currently being investigated as an interesting alternative to packet synchronization. In this paper, the convergence properties of such a system are studied through algebraic graph theory, by modeling the nodes as discrete-time clocks. A general scenario where clocks may have different free-oscillation frequencies is considered, and both time-invariant and time-variant network topologies (or fading channels) are discussed. Furthermore, it is shown that the system of oscillators can be studied as a set of coupled discrete-time PLLs. Based on this observation, a generalized system design is discussed, and it is proved that known results in the context of conventional PLLs for carrier acquisition have a counterpart in distributed systems. Finally, practical details of the implementation of the distributed synchronization algorithm over a bandlimited noisy channel are covered.					; Simeone, Osvaldo/Q-1673-2016	SPAGNOLINI, UMBERTO/0000-0002-7047-2455; Simeone, Osvaldo/0000-0001-9898-3209													1687-1472	1687-1499					2007									57054	10.1155/2007/57054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2007/57054													WOS:000248466300001

The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model representation is extended to the exponential state estimator design for fuzzy stochastic neural networks with time-varying delays. The neuron activation function and the nonlinear measurement equation are assumed to be satisfy sector-bounded conditions and standard Lipschitz conditions. For these two conditions, delay-dependent sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the existence of the desired state estimators for fuzzy stochastic neural networks. Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate that the proposed approaches are effective and that the sector-bounded conditions are weaker than the standard Lipschitz conditions.																			1064-1246	1875-8967					2016	30	5					2915	2926		10.3233/IFS-151789	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/IFS-151789													WOS:000374171500038

It is the first time that CAIDC, as a new hybrid control, is designed. And it removes the constraints of quasi-periodicity compared with intermittent discrete-time state observation control. A structurally balanced signed network model is constructed where agents can be separated into two subgroups to describe signed networks mathematically and present the competing relationship. Based on the assumption of structural balance, the main results are obtained for bipartite synchronization of SMJCSs utilizing graph theory and Lyapunov method. As an application, coupled Chua's circuits with Markov jump are elaborated and several numerical simulations are presented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed results.

To achieve this objective, network virtualization is needed to partition the physical network into various network slices with each slice providing a unique service in the network. In networks with mixed traffics, service operators are required to provide services in isolation since each service has its own defined objective. In such mixed traffics, achieving an efficient and effective resource allocation is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource provisioning scheme involving mixed traffics with multiple base stations in a virtualized radio access network. Since users in each slice have varying requirements on satisfaction regarding the delay and data rate, we propose a customized shape-based heuristic algorithm for users to improve resource utilization and QoS fulfilment. The comprehensive system-level simulation is conducted based on OFDMA air-interface design. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of QoS satisfaction and resource utilization.

As discussed in the paper, regular languages are useful to model a rather wide variety of complex specifications for control systems. The design of decentralized controllers is based on formal methods and, in particular, on the use of discrete abstractions. Efficient synthesis of such controllers is derived by resorting to on-the-fly algorithmic techniques that also allow the use of parallel computing architectures. Advantages and disadvantages of the decentralized approach over a centralized one, also in terms of computational complexity, are discussed.

STOCHASTIC OPTIMAL DESIGN FOR UNKNOWN LINEAR DISCRETE-TIME SYSTEM ZERO-SUM GAMES IN INPUT-OUTPUT FORM UNDER COMMUNICATION CONSTRAINTS	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												In this paper, stochastic optimal strategy for unknown linear discrete-time system quadratic zero-sum games in input-output form with communication imperfections such as network-induced delays and packet losses, otherwise referred to as networked control system (NCS) zero-sum games, relating to the H optimal control problem is solved in a forward-in-time manner. First, the linear discrete-time zero sum state space representation is transformed into a linear NCS in the state space form after incorporating random delays and packet losses and then into the input-output form. Subsequently, the stochastic optimal approach, referred to as adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), is introduced which estimates the cost or value function to solve the infinite horizon optimal regulation of unknown linear NCS quadratic zero-sum games in the presence of communication imperfections. The optimal control and worst case disturbance inputs are derived based on the estimated value function in the absence of state measurements. An update law for tuning the unknown parameters of the value function estimator is derived and Lyapunov theory is used to show that all signals are asymptotically stable (AS) and that the estimated control and disturbance signals converge to optimal control and worst case disturbances, respectively. Simulation results are included to verify the theoretical claims.																			1561-8625	1934-6093				SEP	2014	16	5					1263	1276		10.1002/asjc.804	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asjc.804													WOS:000342987300001

First, we develop a graph-theoretic methodology to design the state feedback law for the second-order consensus networks and vehicle platoons in a discrete-time framework. We analyze the stability of such networks based on algebraic properties of the Laplacian matrices of underlying graphs and each vehicle's update cycle (also known as the time step). We further provide a necessary and sufficient condition of stability of a linear second-order consensus network in the discrete-time domain. Moreover, we evaluate the robustness of the consensus networks by employing the expected value of the steady-state dispersion of the state of the entire network, also known as squared H2 norm, as a performance measure. We show the connection between performance measures with respect to network size, connectivity, and the update cycle. The main contribution of this work is that we provide a formal framework to quantify the relation between scaling performance measures and restrictions of the vehicles' update cycles. Specifically, we show that denser networks (i.e., networks with more communications/edges) require faster agents (i.e., smaller update cycles) to outperform or achieve the same level of robustness as sparse networks (i.e., networks with fewer communications/edges).																			2325-369X		978-1-6654-0673-4				2022							643	648		10.1109/MED54222.2022.9837161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MED54222.2022.9837161													WOS:000854013700105

Each fading channel is modeled as a scalar uncertain stochastic discrete-time system, and the channel noise is described by a discrete-time linear system perturbed by white noise. By using multiple recursive terms and the correlations of the signals in the systems, an optimal linear filter is proposed such that it is im-plemented in a recursive manner.

J	Othman, K; Abdelwahab, H				Othman, Kareem; Abdelwahab, Hassan			PREDICTION OF THE OPTIMUM ASPHALT CONTENT USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS	METALLURGICAL & MATERIALS ENGINEERING												The performance of the asphalt mix is significantly influenced by the optimum asphalt content (OAC). The asphalt content is responsible for coating the aggregate surface and filling the voids between the aggregate particles. Thus, the aggregate gradation has a significant influence on the required asphalt content. The Marshall design process is the most common method used for estimating the OAC, and this process is called the asphalt mix design. However, this method is time consuming, labor intensive, and its results are subjected to variations. Thus, this paper employs the artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the OAC from the aggregate gradation for the two most common gradations used in asphalt mixes in Egypt (3D, 4C). Results show that the proposed ANN can predict the OAC with a coefficient of correlation of 0.98 and an average error of 0.026%. As a result, a new approach for the Marshall test can be adopted using results of the proposed ANN, and only three specimens, instead of fifteen, are prepared and tested for estimating the remaining parameters. This approach saves the time, effort, and resources required for estimating the OAC. Additionally, the ANN was validated with previously developed models, and the ANN shows promising results.

Control of the neural network (plant) is implemented via a communication network. Both quantization and communication network-induced data packet dropouts are considered simultaneously. It is assumed that the plant state signal is quantized by a logarithmic quantizer before transmission, and communication network-induced packet dropouts can be described by a Bernoulli distributed white sequence. A new approach is developed such that controller design can be reduced to the feasibility of linear matrix inequalities, and a desired optimal control gain can be derived in an explicit expression. It is worth pointing out that some new techniques based on a new sector-like expression of quantization errors, and the singular value decomposition of a matrix are developed and employed in the derivation of main results.

This article demonstrates several strategies for integrating qualitative data into interactive network diagrams for the purposes of providing contextual information about actors and their relationships. The result is a new joint display called a Narrated Network Diagram (NND). The development of NNDs aims to make network visualizations more reliable tools for reporting research findings, especially for researchers integrating Social Network Analysis tools into multi- and mixed-methods research designs. Until now, researchers primarily use interactivity to support exploratory analysis of large networks at various scales. However, interactivity can also be used to integrate diverse forms of data without sacrificing perceptual efficiency by essentially hiding significant amounts of text within nodes and edges as tooltips or by delineating additional data within legends, titles, and subtitles.

J	Tang, YF; Chen, SP				Tang, Yingfeng; Chen, Shiping			Supporting Continuous Skyline Queries in Dynamically Weighted Road Networks	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												The paper focuses on the design of an optimum method for handling the continuous skyline query problem in road networks. Existing studies on processing the continuous skyline query focus exclusively on static road networks, which are limited because the state of roads in road networks is constantly changing. Therefore, to apply current methods for dynamically weighted road networks, a distributed skyline query method based on a grid partition method has been proposed in this paper. The method adopts the concepts of a distributed computing framework and road network preprocessing computations in which multiple parallel computing nodes are allocated and organized in grids. Using this approach, the road network map is simplified to a hub graph with much smaller scale such that the query load of the central node can be significantly reduced. The theoretical analysis and experimental results both indicate that, by using the proposed method, the system can achieve quick response time for users as well as a good balance between response times and accuracy. Therefore, it can be concluded that using the proposed method is beneficial for handling continuous skyline queries in a dynamically weighted road network.

However, problems related to knowledge may occur without proper management, which can compromise the strategic objectives associated with a business collaboration network. Given the presented gap, this study aims to propose and test a business-to-business (B2B) knowledge management (KM) framework focused on value co-creation. Therefore, this study seeks to answer the following guiding questions: what are the main elements that a KM model should present in a context of value co-creation between companies? What are the limitations? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Is there any group that would benefit most from it? Design/methodology/approach This is an exploratory study grounded on mixed methods, having a qualitative approach (systematic literature review and content analysis) followed by a quantitative approach (exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis), which grounded the proposed framework. Findings The qualitative approach grounded on the systematic literature review resulting in 38 articles that were submitted to content analysis, which resulted in six record units: active communication between the organization, employees and other stakeholders; documents and organizational knowledge stored; knowledge map; collaborative network; searching tools and database, which provided the KM elements to develop and test the proposed framework by the quantitative approach. The results have shown that the framework may assist in managing knowledge in B2B value co-creation relationships. Research limitations/implications As an exploratory study, the chosen research approach used nonprobabilistic for convenience sampling. Therefore, the results may lack generalizability. Thus, researchers are encouraged to use probabilistic sampling techniques to ensure generability. Also, more and better items should be used to upgrade the initial questionnaire, improving it and, by doing so, have a better scale. Practical implications Assuming the proposed framework's effectiveness, company managers can use it to drive knowledge within the network of interested parties to promote cooperative products and services. In addition, due to the theoretical framework's broad vision, it can serve as a strategic aid to leverage innovation, productivity and competitive advantage. This study also provides an initial instrument that assists in understanding KM elements, which may assist in value co-creation. Originality/value It was learned that the elements, tools, concepts and KM preconized solutions can assist in value co-creation. Considering that value assists business performance, and value co-creation is one way to enhance it, furthermore, by knowledge sharing, the value co-creation may occur in the B2B ecosystem. Also, it is the first theoretical KM framework proposed to assist companies to understand better ways that could get advantages on structuring knowledge, meaning mapping it, sharing it through a system that can retain what is needed and release it to the ones that need and have the defined access to receive it.

J	Sun, W; Lü, JH; Chen, SH; Yu, XH				Sun, Wen; Lu, Jinhu; Chen, Shihua; Yu, Xinghuo			Pinning impulsive control algorithms for complex network	CHAOS												In this paper, we further investigate the synchronization of complex dynamical network via pinning control in which a selection of nodes are controlled at discrete times. Different from most existing work, the pinning control algorithms utilize only the impulsive signals at discrete time instants, which may greatly improve the communication channel efficiency and reduce control cost. Two classes of algorithms are designed, one for strongly connected complex network and another for non-strongly connected complex network. It is suggested that in the strongly connected network with suitable coupling strength, a single controller at any one of the network's nodes can always pin the network to its homogeneous solution. In the non-strongly connected case, the location and minimum number of nodes needed to pin the network are determined by the Frobenius normal form of the coupling matrix. In addition, the coupling matrix is not necessarily symmetric or irreducible. Illustrative examples are then given to validate the proposed pinning impulsive control algorithms.

By designing a new hybrid controller containing negative feedback control and time delay feedback control to control the system, and taking discrete time delay variables as bifurcation parameters, the local stability and Hopf bifurcation of the system are studied. The results show that the Hopf bifurcation can be effectively delayed or avoided by adjusting the value of the feedback control parameter beta. The global asymptotically stable dynamic characteristics of the system are ideal, which has important functional significance for optimizing network congestion control. Finally, a large number of simulation examples verify the correctness of the conclusions.																			1370-4621	1573-773X				DEC	2023	55	7					9295	9314		10.1007/s11063-023-11202-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-023-11202-7		MAR 2023											WOS:000952432700001

Complex interaction of passive multiport structures and their description by separate discrete models	ELECTRONICS LETTERS												It is demonstrated, using the example of a T-junction, that not every multiport structure can be accurately described by a discrete and separated modelling approach at millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths. It is shown that especially stub-networks, which are typically used in RF-matching networks, are affected. In this case, the discrete modelling approach predicts a different resonance frequency than the S-parameter measurement as well as the 3D electromagnetic field simulation (3D-EMFS) of the whole structure. However, these resonances are of particular importance for the design of a RF matching network and should be predicted by the model as precisely as possible. Therefore, the reason for the mismatch by accurate 3D-EMFS is investigated and a possible solution on how to model the so-called complex interactions in passive multiport structures at millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths is provided.																			0013-5194	1350-911X				JAN 8	2016	52	1					52	53		10.1049/el.2015.2753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/el.2015.2753													WOS:000367750500027

The main result obtained in this paper is applied to a wide range of networks, including tandems, cycles and fork-join networks with general blocking and starvation (as well as certain networks with splitting and merging of traffic streams), to deduce the concavity of their throughput as a function of system parameters, such as buffer and initial job configurations, and blocking and starvation parameters. These results have important implications for the optimal design and control of such queueing networks by providing exact solutions, reducing the search space over which optimization need be performed, or establishing the convergence of optimization algorithms. In order to obtain results for such disparate networks in a unified manner, we introduce the framework of constrained discrete event systems (CDES), which enables us to characterize any permutable and non-interruptive queueing network through its constraint set. The main result of this paper establishes comparison properties of the event occurrence processes of CDES as a function of the constraint sets, which are then translated into the above-mentioned concavity of the throughput as a function of system parameters in the context of queueing networks.																			0001-8678	1475-6064				JUN	1998	30	2					551	567		10.1017/S000186780004742X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000186780004742X													WOS:000075231600016

The empirical formula of PCF dispersion is applied instead of numerical simulation to generate a large dataset of phase-matching curves of various PCF designs, which significantly improves the accuracy of the DNN prediction. The accuracies of DNNs' predicted PCF structure parameters are all above 95%. The simulations of the DNN-predicted PCFs structure demonstrate that the FWM wavelength has an average numerical mean square error (MAE) of 1.92 nm from the design target. With the help of DNN, we designed and fabricated a specific PCF for wavelength conversion via FWM from 1064 nm to 770 nm for biomedical imaging applications. Pumped by a microchip laser at 1064 nm, the signal wavelength is measured at 770.2 nm.

Synchronization of discrete-time neural networks with time delays subject to missing data	NEUROCOMPUTING												This paper is concerned with the problem of synchronization of discrete-time neural networks with time-delays under unreliable communication links, which are modeled as stochastic dropouts. The process of missing data satisfies a discrete-time Markov chain with two state components. By using Lyapunov functional approach, some delay-dependent synchronization criteria are first obtained and formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, sufficient conditions on the existence of feedback controllers are derived by employing these newly obtained synchronization criteria. The controller gains can be achieved by solving a set of LMIs. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the design method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

With the emergence of machine learning models, CAMD score functions may be replaced by various surrogates to automatically learn the structure-property relationships. Due to their outstanding performance on graph domains, graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently appeared frequently in CAMD. But using GNNs introduces new optimization challenges. This paper formulates GNNs using mixed -integer programming and then integrates this GNN formulation into the optimization and machine learning toolkit OMLT. To characterize and formulate molecules, we inherit the well -established mixed -integer optimization formulation for CAMD and propose symmetry -breaking constraints to remove symmetric solutions caused by graph isomorphism.

We find that a straight-through-estimator, a method introduced to train binary neural networks, could effectively be applied to incorporate logical constraints into neural network learning. More specifically, we design a systematic way to represent discrete logical constraints as a loss function; minimizing this loss using gradient descent via a straight-through-estimator updates the neural network's weights in the direction that the binarized outputs satisfy the logical constraints. The experimental results show that by leveraging GPUs and batch training, this method scales significantly better than existing neuro-symbolic methods that require heavy symbolic computation for computing gradients. Also, we demonstrate that our method applies to different types of neural networks, such as MLP, CNN, and GNN, making them learn with no or fewer labeled data by learning directly from known constraints.																			2640-3498						2022																								WOS:000900130206014

J	Hu, SL; Yue, D; Shi, M; Xie, XP				Hu, Songlin; Yue, Dong; Shi, Min; Xie, Xiangpeng			Discrete-Time Event-Triggered Control of Nonlinear Wireless Networked Control Systems	ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS												This paper investigates the problem of stabilization of nonlinear discrete-time networked control systems (NCSs) with event-triggering communication scheme in the presence of signal transmission delay. A Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model and paralleldistributed compensation (PDC) scheme are first employed to design a nonlinear fuzzy event-triggered controller for the stabilization of nonlinear discrete-time NCSs. The idea of the event-triggering communication scheme (i.e., a soft computation algorithm) under consideration is that the current sensor data is transmitted only when the current sensor data and the previously transmitted one satisfy a certain state-dependent trigger condition. By taking the signal transmission delay into consideration and using delay system approach, a T-S fuzzy delay system model is established to describe the nonlinear discrete-time NCSs with event-triggering communication scheme. Attention is focused on the design of fuzzy event-triggered controller which ensures asymptotic stability of the closed-loop fuzzy systems. Linear matrix inequality-(LMI-) based conditions are formulated for the existence of admissible fuzzy event-triggered controller. If these conditions are feasible, a desired fuzzy event-triggered controller can be readily constructed.

The prediction of the current stochastic C-A delay is achieved based on the quantizing method and the estimated DTHMM. Then, by taking the current predicted C-A delay into account, a state-feedback controller is designed to directly compensate for the effect of the current real C-A delay on the NCS. The detailed procedure of the K-means clustering used to quantize the past C-A delays is given. The contrastive simulation experiments are implemented, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the quantizing and predictive methods proposed in this paper.																			2161-2927		978-988-15638-1-1				2012							5921	5926																WOS:000393905906009

OMNeT++ is fully programmable and modular, and it was designed from the ground up to support modeling very large networks built from reusable model components. Large emphasis was placed also on easy traceability and debuggability of simulation models: one can execute the simulation under a powerful graphical user interface, which makes the internals of a simulation model fully visible to the person running the simulation: it displays the network graphics, animates the message flow and lets the user peek into objects and variables within the model. These features make OMNeT++ a good candidate for both research and educational purposes. The OMNeT++ simulation engine can be easily embedded into larger applications. OMNeT++ is open-source, free for non-profit use, and it has a fairly large user community.																					1-56555-225-3				2001							319	325																WOS:000172097600053

The ECG signals were decomposed into time-frequency representations using discrete wavelet transform and statistical features were calculated to depict their distribution. The first level networks were implemented for ECG beats classification using the statistical features as inputs. To improve diagnostic accuracy, the second level networks were trained using the outputs of the first level networks as input data. Four types of ECG beats (normal beat, congestive heart failure beat, ventricular tachyarrhythmia beat, atrial fibrillation beat) obtained from the Physiobank database were classified with the accuracy of 96.94% by the combined neural network. The combined neural network model achieved accuracy rates which were higher than that of the stand-alone neural network model.

J	Juang, CF; Chung, IF				Juang, Chia-Feng; Chung, I-Fang			Recurrent fuzzy network design using hybrid evolutionary learning algorithms	NEUROCOMPUTING												This paper proposes a recurrent fuzzy network design using the hybridization of a multigroup genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (R-MGAPSO). The recurrent fuzzy network designed here is the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK)-type recurrent fuzzy network (TRFN), in which each fuzzy rule comprises spatial and temporal sub-rules. Both the number of fuzzy rules and the parameters in a TRFN are designed simultaneously by R-MGAPSO. In R-MGAPSO, the techniques of variable-length individuals and the local version of particle swarm optimization are incorporated into a genetic algorithm, where individuals with the same length constitute the same group, and there are multigroups in a population. Population evolution consists of three major operations: elite enhancement by particle swarm optimization, sub-rule alignment-based crossover, and mutation. To verify the performance of R-MGAPSO, dynamic plant and a continuous-stirred tank reactor controls are simulated. R-MGAPSO performance is also compared with genetic algorithms in these simulations.

A scheduling policy is raised to accommodate a limited number of node-controller connections which depend on the periodic communication sequences and dynamic dwell time. Then, the neural network technique is employed to dynamically allocate bit rate for the scheduling nodes. The networked control systems are modeled as discrete-time switched systems with bounded disturbances.

In this work, the state feedback controllers are designed to ensure the GES of response and drive systems, and the controller gains are directly computed by the network parameters. Then, a numerical example is presented to explain the correctness of the synchronization theory. Moreover, a technique to audio encryption/decryption is proposed, and it is applied to a practical example to verify the applicability of the technique. The advantages of this paper are as follows: (i) GES criterion containing a group of simple matrix inequalities is established without the construction of a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), which is not always obvious; (ii) the controller gains are directly represented by the parameters in the network, and then it is easy to apply them to the audio encryption.

More specifically, we incorporate bagging and gradient boosting methods in building artificial neural networks (ANN) ensembles (bagged artificial neural networks (BANN) and gradient boosted artificial neural networks (GBANN)), first. Coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) statics are used for performance evaluation of proposed predictive models. Empirical results show that ensemble models (R-BANN(2)=0.9278, R-GBANN(2)=0.9270) are superior to a conventional ANN model (R-ANN(2)=0.9088). Then, we use the coupling of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ANN ensembles for enhancing the prediction accuracy. The study concludes that DWT is an effective tool for increasing the accuracy of the ANN ensembles (R-WBANN(2)=0.9397. R-WGBANN(2)=0.9528). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we present a polyhedral approach for designing survivable networks.

One of the challenges in the Long Term Evolution (LTE) 4G networks is the low data rate for cell-edge users as well as coverage gaps. In this paper, we define and evaluate models for analysis of performance of mobile networks architectures defined by 3GPP.

The proposed model implements the deployment layout of the Base Station (BS) cellular antennas, and it manages the distribution and movement of the User Equipment (UE) devices. The model calculates the Propagation for each BS, as well as the path loss in the links between BSs and the UEs in the range. It also computes the power received by the BS and the UE in each link.

A skyline query retrieves the skyline points that are not dominated by others in terms of static and dynamic attributes (i.e., the road distance). This paper addresses the issue of efficiently processing continuous skyline queries in road networks. Two novel and important distance-based skyline queries are presented, namely, the continuous d(epsilon)-skyline query (Cd-epsilon-SQ) and the continuous k nearest neighbor-skyline query (Cknn-SQ). A grid index is first designed to effectively manage the information of data objects and then two algorithms are proposed, the Cd-epsilon-SQ algorithm and the Cd-epsilon-SQ(+) algorithm, which are combined with the grid index to answer the Cd-epsilon-SQ. Similarly, the Cknn-SQ algorithm and the Cknn-SQ(+) algorithm are developed to efficiently process the Cknn-SQ. Extensive experiments using real road network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Machens, CK; Brody, CD				Machens, Christian K.; Brody, Carlos D.			Design of continuous attractor networks with monotonic tuning using a symmetry principle	NEURAL COMPUTATION												Neurons that sustain elevated firing in the absence of stimuli have been found in many neural systems. In graded persistent activity, neurons can sustain firing at many levels, suggesting a widely found type of network dynamics in which networks can relax to any one of a continuum of stationary states. The reproduction of these findings in model networks of nonlinear neurons has turned out to be nontrivial. A particularly insightful model has been the "bump attractor," in which a continuous attractor emerges through an underlying symmetry in the network connectivity matrix. This model, however, cannot account for data in which the persistent firing of neurons is a monotonic-rather than a bell-shaped-function of a stored variable. Here, we show that the symmetry used in the bump attractor network can be employed to create a whole family of continuous attractor networks, including those with monotonic tuning. Our design is based on tuning the external inputs to networks that have a connectivity matrix with Toeplitz symmetry. In particular, we provide a complete analytical solution of a line attractor network with monotonic tuning and show that for many other networks, the numerical tuning of synaptic weights reduces to the computation of a single parameter.

The purpose of the model is to investigate the specific traffic characteristics of high-speed trains under the interruption of stochastic irregular events. In the model, the high-speed rail traffic system is supposed to be equipped with the moving-block signalling system to guarantee maximum traversing capacity of the railway. To keep the safety of trains' movements, some operational strategies are proposed to control the movements of trains in the model, including traction operation, braking operation, and entering-station operation. The numerical simulations show that the designed model can well describe the movements of high-speed trains on the rail network. The research results can provide the useful information not only for investigating the propagation features of relevant delays under the irregular disturbance but also for rerouting and rescheduling trains on the rail network.

Transportat Res Board				The continuous network design problem that occurs when the origin-destination time-dependent demands are random variables with known probability distributions is described. A chance-constraint and two-stage linear programming formulation are introduced based on a system optimum dynamic traffic assignment model that propagates traffic according to the cell transmission model. The introduced approaches are limited to continuous link improvements and do not provide for new link additions. The chance-constrained model is tested on an example network that resembles a freeway corridor to demonstrate the simplicity and applicability of the approach. Initial results suggest that planning for an inflated demand may produce benefits in terms of system performance and reduced variance.

In this paper, a continuous object tracking scheme with two-layer grid model (TGM-COT) is proposed. To address the problem of boundary distortion caused by uneven node distribution, we put forward a novel mechanism for boundary nodes identification. Furthermore, a streamlining mechanism is designed to reduce the amount of uploaded data. Simulation results demonstrate that, without sacrificing additional energy consumption, TGM-COT is able to achieve high tracking accuracy and significantly reduce the communication overhead.

By incorporating the generalized quadratic Lyapunov function with the discrete-time Bellman-Gronwall inequality, a new upper bound about the quantization precision parameter of the infinite-level logarithmic quantizer is derived to design quantized protocol, under which agents in strongly connected directed networks can attain weighted average consensus. The obtained new upper bound clearly characterizes the intimate relationship between the quantization precision parameter and the directed network topology property. The proposed quantized protocol takes the joint effects of information quantization and network topology into consideration, and therefore, it is in particular applicable to digital networks where bidirectional and/or balanced message passing among agents is not available.

Packet losses in the networked control systems (NCSs) have been modelled by utilising the probability and the characteristics of the sources and the destinations. Here, the well-known Bernoulli random binary distribution is used to model consecutive packet losses in the NCSs. In this study, first, a robust observer-based discrete-time sliding mode control is proposed for the NCSs including random packet losses. The packet losses occur in the channels from the sensors to the controller and the channels from the controller to the actuators. Then, using the notion of exponential mean square stability, the boundedness of the obtained closed-loop system is analysed with a linear matrix inequality approach. Our proposed robust ODSMC can be applied to unstable NCSs, and there is no need to stabilise the underlying system in advance. Illustrative examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

After analyzing the fundamental and harmonic impedances of the CCF-1 mode and converting them from the intrinsic current generator plane to the package plane, the optimal load impedances can be obtained, which were also verified by using load-pull simulations. Then, a low-pass filtering matching network was designed to achieve desired impedance transformation. A 2-4 GHz broadband CCF-1 PA was designed and fabricated to verify the proposed method.

J	Gorski, T				Gorski, Tomasz			Continuous Delivery of Blockchain Distributed Applications	SENSORS												Ensuring a production-ready state of the application under development is the imminent feature of the Continuous Delivery (CD) approach. In a blockchain network, nodes communicate and store data in a distributed manner. Each node executes the same business application but operates in a distinct execution environment. The literature lacks research focusing on continuous practices for blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Specifically, it lacks such works with support for both design and deployment. The author has proposed a solution that takes into account the continuous delivery of a business application to diverse deployment environments in the DLT network. As a result, two continuous delivery pipelines have been implemented using the Jenkins automation server. The first pipeline prepares a business application whereas the second one generates complete node deployment packages. As a result, the framework ensures the deployment package in the actual version of the business application with the node-specific up-to-date version of deployment configuration files. The Smart Contract Design Pattern has been used when building a business application. The modeling aspect of blockchain network installation has required using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the UML Profile for Distributed Ledger Deployment. The refined model-to-code transformation generates deployment configurations for nodes. Both the business application and deployment configurations are stored in the GitHub repositories. For the sake of verification, tests have been conducted for the electricity consumption and supply management system designed for prosumers of renewable energy.

In this study, we propose quantum teleportation and remote state preparation schemes between users of two space-separated local networks established by continuous-variable multipartite entangled states. In the proposed schemes, the quantum nodes belonging to the two distant local networks are first entangled by entanglement swapping, and then quantum communication protocols are realized. We show that quantum teleportation between any two users belonging to space-separated local networks can be realized with the assistance of other users, and squeezed thermal states can be remotely prepared in one local network by performing a homodyne projective measurement on the state in another distant local network. Our results provide a feasible approach for quantum communication between space-separated quantum networks with multipartite entangled states.																			1674-733X	1869-1919				APR	2024	67	4							142502	10.1007/s11432-023-3913-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-023-3913-2													WOS:001197226200003

First, we designed a system delay model for the transmission time-delay contained in the system. Based on the designed time-delay model, the input delay method was used to convert the synchronous controller solution problem into a stability problem for the corresponding time-delay system. Second, by using a piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with the Jensen's inequality, both the stability condition of the continuous-time nonlinear systems and the solution method of sampling controller were given. The designed sampling controller is able to update the control parameters only when the triggering rules are fulfilled, thus reducing the transmission rate of the network. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by numerical simulation. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present work mainly discussed the feasibility of preparing continuous CNT networks in composite: Fiber fabric was immersed into CNT aqueous solution (containing dispersant) followed by freeze drying and pyrolysis process, prior to epoxy infusion. The morphologies of fabric with CNTs were observed by Scanning Electron Microscope. The relationship between CNT networks and flowing epoxy resin was studied. Properties of composite, including out-of-plane electrical conductivity and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), were measured. The results demonstrated that continuous and porous CNT networks formed by entangled CNTs could be assembled in fiber fabric. Most part of them were preserved in composite due to the robustness of network structures. The preserved CNT networks significantly improved out-of-plane electrical conductivity, and also have an effect on ILSS value. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Resmi, R; Mija, SJ; Jeevamma, J				Resmi, R.; Mija, S. J.; Jeevamma, Jacob			Model predictive consensus in networked autonomous systems using discrete Laguerre functions and event triggering approach	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												This paper presents the consensus problem of general linear discrete time networked autonomous agents, using distributed model predictive control (DMPC) and event triggering algorithm. The computational complexity of conventional DMPC is high due to the large values of prediction horizon and control horizon required for real time systems. The increased computational load becomes an obstruction in the practical implementation of DMPC. To solve the issue, a novel design methodology of parameterizing the control input using discrete Laguerre functions is adopted in this paper. The predictive control protocol is applied to a group of networked autonomous agents operating on event triggered consensus algorithm. The proposed event triggered algorithm offers the advantages of lesser communication between the agents along with reduction in controller updates. The closed loop stability of the networked system is established using Lyapunov criterion, based on the terminal state's equality constraint. Comparison of the proposed algorithm with existing works through numerical examples shows significant reduction in computational load, design parameters and data transmission, while achieving comparable performance. To validate the theoretical results, simulation is carried out on a group of autonomous vehicles and the usefulness of the proposed algorithm on system performance is illustrated.

It is felt that the conventional methods of design of concrete mixes may not be suitable for HPC because, with the addition of silica fume, more water content is needed that can be eliminated by using high range water reducing admixtures for achieving the same workability. Further, the compressive strength and workability properties of HPC mixes are greatly influenced by several parameters, viz. fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, water-cement ratios, and percentage of silicafume and super-plasticizer. Consequently, developing a standard mix design procedure for HPC mixes requires an extensive understanding of relation between these parameters and the properties of the resulting mix. Developing an empirical formula for predicting the compressive strength and workability of HPC is extremely difficult because of non-linear interaction among the various parameters.																			0971-4588					APR	2002	9	2					109	114																WOS:000175064500004

A singular perturbation parameter reflects the two-time-scale property of Markov jump complex networks.

This research explores the influencing factors of the continuous usage intention of ASNSs. Design/methodology/approach A survey of academics in China was conducted, and 361 responses were collected and analyzed with a structural equation model, which involves satisfaction, continuous usage intention, expectation confirmation, perceived usefulness (PU), social identity, referent network size and perceived interactivity (PI). Findings Satisfaction, expectation confirmation, PU, referent network size, social identity and PI significantly impact continuous usage intention. Satisfaction is a mediating variable by which expectation confirmation, PU, referent network size, social identity and other influencing factors affect continuous usage intention. Expectation confirmation and referent network size are two endogenous variables that can explain and predict the continuous usage intention of ASNSs. Originality/value Existing research does not consciously distinguish between adoption, use and continuous use, and only scant studies have conducted empirical research. Further, despite the widespread ASNS usage in China, Chinese scholars' studies are few, as existing studies have mainly focused on users of the UK, the US and India.

We present two dynamic, large-scale mixed-integer programs for long-term care network design that execute jointly strategic and tactical facility location, modular capacity acquisition, and patient-assignment decisions. The first model is an adaptive network-design model whose focus is more strategic in nature, whereas the second model focuses exclusively on the expansion of an existing long-term care network and incorporates additional tactical decisions such as patient backlogs. Working directly with the president of the Order of Quebec Nursesthe provincial organization representing over 75,000 nurseswe incorporate facets such as assignment permanence, as well as develop and measure patient-centric quality-of-life proxies such as geographic mis-assignment and un-assigned patients, the latter of which is quantified via parametric optimization. Various network-design and patient-assignment policies are explored. We conclude that the use of home care as an alternative to long-term care facilities is cost prohibitive under specific conditions. Employing a bisection algorithm, we identify the implicit cost placed on keeping medically stable elderly patients in a hospital ward, concluding no cost savings are generated from such a policy.

Online reinforcement learning-based neural network controller design for affine nonlinear discrete-time systems	2007 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-13	Proceedings of the American Control Conference				26th American Control Conference	JUL 09-13, 2007	New  York, NY					In this paper, a novel reinforcement learning neural network (NN)-based controller, referred to adaptive critic controller, is proposed for general multi-input and multi-output affine unknown nonlinear discrete-time systems in the presence of bounded disturbances. Adaptive critic designs consist of two entities, an action network that produces optimal solution and a critic that evaluates the performance of the action network. The critic is termed adaptive as it adapts itself to output the optimal cost-to-go function and the action network is adapted simultaneously based on the information from the critic. In our online learning method, one NN is designated as the critic NN, which approximates the Bellman equation. An action NN is employed to derive the control signal to track a desired system trajectory while minimizing the cost function. Online updating weight tuning schemes for these two NNs are also derived and uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and weight estimates is shown. The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated on a two-link robotic arm system.																			0743-1619	2378-5861	978-1-4244-0988-4				2007							3425	3430																WOS:000252258802097

A Two-Tier Control Architecture for Nonlinear Process Systems with Continuous/Asynchronous Feedback	2009 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	Proceedings of the American Control Conference				American Control Conference 2009	JUN 10-12, 2009	St Louis, MO					In this work, we introduce a two-tier control architecture for nonlinear process systems with both continuous and asynchronous sensing and/or actuation. This class of systems arises naturally in the context of process control systems based on hybrid communication networks (i.e, point-to-point wired links integrated with networked wired/wireless communication) and utilizing multiple heterogeneous measurements (e.g., temperature and concentration). Assuming that there exists a lower-tier control system which relies on point-to-point communication and continuous measurements to stabilize the closed-loop system, we propose to use Lyapunov-based model predictive control to design an upper-tier networked control system to profit from both the continuous and the asynchronous measurements as well as from additional networked control actuators. The proposed two-tier control system architecture preserves the stability properties of the lower-tier controller while improving the closed-loop performance. The theoretical results are demonstrated using a chemical process example.

First, an appropriate reliable control strategy is proposed for MINNs, which takes the influence of actuator failures into account. Second, by combining Lyapunov functional theory with new analysis techniques, novel theoretical results to guarantee the FTS for the concerned MINNs are acquired, and the desired reliable controller gains are obtained simultaneously. In additions, compared with the previous research works, the FTS results obtained in this paper are established directly from the MINNs themselves without using variable transformation method.

However, classical rubber elasticity theories often fall short in their description of the network structure, while simulation techniques at molecular scale remain impractical at that length scale. Here we develop a computational approach based on random discrete networks, in which the polymer network is represented as an assembly of non-linear springs connected at crosslinking points. The density of elastically-effective chains, average network coordination and chain contour lengths are varied independently in order to identify their respective contributions to the network elasticity. Numerical results suggest scaling relations between network parameters and elastic properties that are markedly different from the predictions of classical rubber elasticity theories. In particular, the elastic modulus of 2D random networks is found to be independent of density at constant topology, and proportional to the average coordination at constant density. The discrepancy is due to the pre-straining of the chains in the discrete network, which is not accounted for in classical models of rubber elasticity. Our results have implications for the interpretation of experimental data for ideal network gels that are formed by the cross-coupling of macromolecular building blocks in solution.

By using disturbance/uncertainty estimation and attenuation technique, an event-based sampled-data composite controller is proposed together with a discrete-time extended state observer. Under the presented new framework, the newest state and disturbance estimates as well as the control signals are not transmitted via the common sensor-controller network, but instead communicated and calculated until a discrete-time event-triggering condition is violated. Compared with the periodic updates in the traditional time-triggered active disturbance rejection control, the proposed ET-ADRC scheme can remarkably reduce the communication frequency while maintaining a satisfactory closed-loop system performance. The proposed discrete-time control scheme provides the engineers with a manner of direct and easier implementation via networked digital computers. It is shown that the bounded stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed. Finally, an application design example of a dc-dc buck converter with experimental results is conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.

Using a mixed methods research design that combines hyperlink network analysis and micro-discourse analysis, it examines the online characteristics of the Caucasus Emirate and the main frames conveyed by the websites affiliated with the Emirate. It demonstrates the existence of a network of cross-referencing websites that, collectively, articulate the Emirate's political agenda online and allow for the dissemination of frames across the Web. It also shows that while jihadism provides a cultural resource that fosters a global sense of community, the jihadization of discourse does not eradicate local references as the local dynamics of the conflict have a strong impact on online communicative strategies.

First, the dimensionality of the original face image is reduced by using the DCT and the large area illumination variations are alleviated by discarding the first few low-frequency DCT coefficients. Next, the truncated DCT coefficient vectors are clustered using the proposed clustering algorithm. This process makes the subsequent FLD more efficient. After implementing the FLD, the most discriminating an invariant facial features are maintained and the training samples are clustered well. As a consequence, further parameter estimation for the RBF neural networks is fulfilled easily which facilitates fast training in the RBF neural networks. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves excellent performance with high training and recognition speed, high recognition rate as well as very good illumination robustness.

To more effectively utilize the limited network resource, a new dynamic event-triggered mechanism is proposed, which can effectively reduce network information transmission and save bandwidth on the premise of ensuring system performance. By considering the effect of the event-triggered mechanism and two types of cyberattacks, the filtering error system model has been constructed. Two independent random variables obeying the Bernoulli distribution are introduced to describe the two types of cyberattacks. Sufficient conditions that can guarantee the admissibility of the filtering error system have been developed with Lyapunov stability theory and LMIs techniques. Moreover, the co-design method is present in terms of LMIs to derive the parameters of dynamic event-triggered mechanism and the designed H-infinity filter synchronously. Finally, an illustrative example is employed to verify the usefulness of the proposed method.

However, the weather is complex in the real world. So networks designed for single tasks are usually difficult to apply. Therefore, we propose a task-adaptive attention module to enable the network to restore images with multiple degradation factors. The task-adaptive attention module mainly includes three parts: Task-Adaptive sub-network, Task Channel Attention, and Task Operation Attention. To evaluate the model, we construct a mixed degradation factors dataset that combines three degradation factors of rain, haze, and raindrop. The experimental results show that our method not only better restores images with mixed degradation factors, but also show competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art models of each task.

The communication process of the whole network is controlled by a set of trigger conditions monitored by each agent. The trigger condition and event-triggered distributed subgradient optimization algorithm for each agent are completely decentralized and just rest with each agent's and its neighboring agents' individual states at the event-triggered sequence of themselves as well as each agent's local objective function. At each time instant, each agent updates its state by employing its own objective function and the states collected from itself and its neighboring agents at their separate event-triggered time instants. A sufficient cohdition for ensuring the consensus and reaching the optimization solution is established under the condition that the undirected network topology is connected and the design parameters are properly designed. Theoretical analysis shows that the event-triggered distributed subgradient algorithm is capable of steering the whole network of agents asymptotically converge to an optimal solution of the convex optimization problem. Simulation results validate effectiveness of the introduced algorithm and demonstrate feasibility of the theoretical analysis.					zhao, wei/JZD-4475-2024	Xia, Dawen/0000-0002-0151-9643; Li, Huaqing/0000-0001-6310-8965													0925-2312	1872-8286				APR 26	2017	235						255	263		10.1016/j.neucom.2017.01.021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2017.01.021													WOS:000395219700027

The tactical design of barge scheduled transport services involves fleet selection and routing through the inland waterway network.

We develop a tight MILP formulation for the Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing (FSMVRP) especially adapted for the Port-Hinterland multi-modal barge network design. Also, an analytical model is developed to help understand important design trade-offs made. We consider the case of horizontal cooperation of dry port container terminals that share capacity.

Being different from conventional gradient-based neural networks (GNN), such RNN (termed specifically as Zhang neural networks, ZNN) are designed based on matrix-valued error functions, instead of scalar-valued norm-based energy functions. In this paper, we generalize and further investigate the ZNN model for time-varying matrix square root finding. For the purpose of possible hardware (e.g., digital circuit) realization, a discrete-time ZNN model is constructed and developed, which incorporates Newton iteration as a special case. Besides, to obtain an appropriate step-size value (in each iteration), a line-search algorithm is employed for the proposed discrete-time ZNN model. Computer-simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed ZNN model aided with a line-search algorithm, in addition to the connection and explanation to Newton iteration for matrix square root finding.

However, designing a proper network is challenging due to limited information and, more importantly, the correlated demand uncertainty that exists among affected areas. We consider a network design problem for humanitarian relief purposes, where demand correlations exist and demand information is limited, i.e., only the mean demand and covariance matrix are known. Note that the covariance matrix can explicitly capture the correlated demand among areas. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer two-stage distributionally robust location-inventory model, which is generally NP-hard and computationally intractable. The model is further reformulated as a mixed-integer conic problem based on copositive cones, and it is tractable with positive semidefinite relaxation. To accelerate the problem-solving process, we design an interpretable branching-and-pricing heuristic with a warm start. Both semi-case study and simulation results demonstrate that explicitly modelling demand correlation can decrease unmet demand.

J	Nag, A; Tornatore, M; Mukherjee, B				Nag, Avishek; Tornatore, Massimo; Mukherjee, Biswanath			Optical Network Design With Mixed Line Rates and Multiple Modulation Formats	JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY												With the growth of traffic volume and the emergence of various new applications, future telecom networks are expected to be increasingly heterogeneous with respect to applications supported and underlying technologies employed. To address this heterogeneity, it may be most cost effective to set up different lightpaths at different bit rates in such a backbone telecom mesh network employing optical wavelength-division multiplexing. This approach can be cost effective because low-bit-rate services will need less grooming (i.e., less multiplexing with other low-bit-rate services onto high-capacity wavelengths), while a high-bit-rate service can be accommodated directly on a wavelength itself. Optical networks with mixed line rates (MLRs), e. g., 10/40/100 Gb/s over different wavelength channels, are a new networking paradigm. The unregenerated reach of a lightpath depends on its line rate. So, the assignment of a line rate to a lightpath is a tradeoff between its capacity and transparent reach. Thus, based on their signal-quality constraints (threshold bit error rate), intelligent assignment of line rates to lightpaths can minimize the need for signal regeneration. This constraint on the transparent reach based on threshold signal quality can be relaxed by employing more advanced modulation formats, but with more investment.

J	Ye, YP; Wang, H; Zhang, XN; Li, R				Ye, Yipeng; Wang, Hua; Zhang, Xiaoning; Li, Rui			Joint Optimization of Road Classification and Road Capacity for Urban Freight Transportation Networks	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS												In previous studies, almost all urban network design models/methods made attempts to optimize transportation system performance, such as minimizing road traffic congestion, by determining optimal road capacity expansion schemes, with the assumption of indestructible road infrastructure. However, road infrastructure definitely deteriorates over time, and needs periodic maintenance and repairs. This paper proposes a bilevel programming model for the urban freight transportation network design problem (UFTNDP) by taking into account the heterogeneity of road classifications and road damages from the perspective of road maintenance. The model aims to improve network performance as much as possible by determining an optimal joint scheme of road capacities and classifications. At the upper level, road planning aims to minimize total system cost by determining a joint optimal scheme of road capacities and road classifications. The lower level is a traffic assignment problem that characterizes network users' path choice behavior. We then propose an improved system optimum (SO) relaxation-based method to solve the optimization model. Numerical examples validated the developed model and tested the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results revealed that (1) the improved solution algorithm performs better, because it saves 97.3% of computational time compared with the original SO relaxation-based method; (2) the algorithm has the potential to be extended to solving a general discrete network design problem; and (3) a simultaneous optimization of road classification and capacity works better in improving system performance of an urban freight transportation network.					zhang, xiaoning/G-7018-2012	wang, hua/0000-0002-7150-5247													2473-2907	2473-2893				OCT 1	2020	146	10							04020122	10.1061/JTEPBS.0000446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/JTEPBS.0000446													WOS:000639575100012

For saving communication resource, a novel discrete-time dynamic periodic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is first developed for the sensor network. Under the proposed method, the sensor node calculates the ETM in a periodic manner and the threshold is adjusted dynamically. Thereafter, a distributed set-membership estimator is constructed, and a probability-based estimated ellipsoidal constraint is put forward to acquire a more flexible set-membership estimation algorithm. Simultaneously, an auxiliary-function-dependent approach is proposed to derive the criterion for the co-design of the probabilistic-constrained set-membership estimator and the event-triggered parameter such that the system states reside in the estimated ellipsoid with a pre-specified probability. The auxiliary function is constructed in a piecewise style aiming to deal with the sawtooth constraint of sampling signals. Furthermore, a recursive convex optimization algorithm with regard to the estimated ellipsoid is presented. Finally, a simulation example is employed to verify the validity of the developed method.

AN INQUIRY INTO PREFERENCE STABILITY USING DISCRETE MIXTURES OF NEURAL NETWORKS	REVUE ECONOMIQUE												We introduce a new test of preference stability across consumers, based on a discrete mixture model of feedforward neural networks, designed to detect clusters of consumers following distinct consumption functions. The procedure is tested on simulated data and applied to two sets of Canadian household consumption micro-data (1969-1986 and 2004-2008). On both these datasets we find that two clusters best explain the data, thus rejecting preference stability.

The new type of metamaterials are inspired by digital filters and consist of first sampling an optical wave in space and then designing a metamaterial that performs a desired operation on the spatially discretized wave. The design of the metamaterial boils down to the design of a discrete-port network with a given scattering matrix, which can be efficiently accomplished through inverse design algorithms. In this way, we are not limited to specific operations matching the inherent nonlocal responses of metamaterials, as happens with conventional computational metamaterials, and can implement complex mathematical operations.																					978-1-7335096-2-6				2021										10.1109/ACES53325.2021.00110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACES53325.2021.00110													WOS:000724169800162

Neural inverse optimal control for discrete-time impulsive systems	NEUROCOMPUTING												Impulsive systems describe processes with at least one state variable is impulsively changeable. The design of optimal control policies in impulsive systems is a complex task. In order to relax the solution for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, a meaningful cost functional can be proposed a posteriori in the inverse optimal problem. The main contribution of this paper is a neural inverse optimal control for discrete-time impulsive systems. Control policies for discrete-time impulsive systems are derived by combining inverse optimal control into a recurrent high order neural network (RHONN) trained with the Extended Kalman filter (EKF). The neural network avoids the development of a mathematical model to represent the studied system. For illustration, we apply the proposed neurocontrol to personalized drug treatment in influenza infection disease, whose nonlinear model is included and described for completeness. The robustness of the proposed framework is tested through Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, JJ; Pan, XZ; Hao, XZ				Huang, Jinjie; Pan, Xiaozhen; Hao, Xianzhi			Event-triggered Networked <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> Output Tracking Control Based on Dynamic Compensation Controller	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND SYSTEMS												In this paper, the event-triggered H-infinity output tracking problem is investigated for networked control systems. In order to reduce the output tracking error as well as to improve network resource utilization, we propose an idea of dynamic compensation controller with the discrete-time event-triggered mechanism, that is, the integral term of tracking error and the state of the reference system are introduced to form states of the augmented system. We first examine the dynamic compensation idea by the H-infinity output tracking control problem for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Then, we model the closed-loop event-triggered networked control system as a time-delay augmented linear system. By constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with the delay fractioning technique, the stability conditions with lower conservatism are derived in the form of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, a method is proposed to design the H-infinity dynamic compensation controllers and the discrete-time event-triggered mechanisms. Finally, the satellite tracking control problem is used as an example to show that the dynamical compensation idea is effective in reducing the tracking error and that the proposed method in this paper can achieve better performance than that in the existing literature.																			1598-6446	2005-4092				OCT	2021	19	10					3318	3331		10.1007/s12555-020-0478-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12555-020-0478-6		MAR 2021											WOS:000635051700004

J	Wan, XB; Fang, HJ				Wan, Xiongbo; Fang, Huajing			Fault detection for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems subject to network-induced uncertainties	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												This paper addresses the problem of fault detection (FD) for discrete-time systems with global Lipschitz conditions and network-induced uncertainties. By utilizing Bernoulli stochastic variables and a switching signal, a unified measurement model is proposed to describe three kinds of network-induced uncertainties, that is, access constraints, time delays, and packet dropouts. We aim to design a mode-dependent fault detection filter (FDF) such that, for all external disturbances and the above uncertainties, the error between the residual and fault is made as small as possible. The addressed FD problem is then converted into an auxiliary H8 filtering problem for discrete-time stochastic system with multiple time-varying delays. By applying the Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach, a sufficient condition for the existence of the FDF is derived in terms of certain linear matrix inequalities (LMI). When these LMIs are feasible, the explicit expression of the desired FDF can also be characterized. A numerical example is exploited to show the effectiveness of the results obtained.

Here, a series of mutually independent Bernoulli distributed random variables is introduced to model the phenomena of the ROU, RVNs and MSCDs, where the occurrence probabilities of above phenomena are allowed to be uncertain. For the addressed systems, an SMC strategy is given such that, for above network-induced phenomena, the stability of the resulted sliding motion can be guaranteed by presenting a new delay-dependent sufficient criterion via the delay-fractioning method. Moreover, the discrete sliding mode controller is synthesized such that the state trajectories of the system are driven onto a neighborhood of the specified sliding surface and remained thereafter, i.e., the reachability condition in discrete-time setting is verified. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed SMC method is illustrated by utilizing a numerical example. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, an IT2 fuzzy nonlinear MJSs model with parameter uncertainties is established by using IT2 fuzzy model, and the fuzzy filter is designed with different premise variables. Second, a novel mixed-triggered scheme is addressed, which can reduce the needless waste of network resources. Then, two Bernoulli stochastic variables are employed, one to randomly switch the different modes of the mixed-triggered scheme, the other to describe the randomly occurring packet dropouts. Next, in order to ensure that IT2 fuzzy filtering error system is asymptotically stable, sufficient conditions are presented. Moreover, the existence conditions for the fuzzy filter are given by the linear matrix inequalities. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the validity of the proposed method.

Proper selection of the inertia weight for the APSO gives a balance between global and local searching. The research results show that a larger weight helps to increase the convergence speed while a smaller one benefits the convergence accuracy. This APSO-based method can automatically update template parameters of a discrete-time cellular neural network and optimize them to remove noise interference in polluted images. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed APSO-CNN methodology.

When the delay is less than the transmission interval, we prove that the stability of the closed-loop system is implied by that of a switched system. Based on theories on switched systems, we present stabilizing conditions by using packet-loss-dependent Lyapunov functions, and design multiple controllers depending on the packet loss and the network-induced delay. Furthermore, based on the stabilizing conditions, we discuss the robustness of the stabilization against the packet loss and the network-induced delay. Several numerical examples and simulations are worked out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.

J	Pfetsch, ME; Schmitt, A				Pfetsch, Marc E.; Schmitt, Andreas			A generic optimization framework for resilient systems	OPTIMIZATION METHODS & SOFTWARE												This paper addresses the optimal design of resilient systems, in which components can fail. The system can react to failures and its behaviour is described by general mixed integer nonlinear programs, which allows for applications to many (technical) systems. This then leads to a three-level optimization problem. The upper level designs the system minimizing a cost function, the middle level represents worst-case failures of components, i.e. interdicts the system, and the lowest level operates the remaining system. We describe new inequalities that characterize the set of resilient solutions and allow to reformulate the problem. The reformulation can then be solved using a nested branch-and-cut approach. We discuss several improvements, for instance, by taking symmetry into account and strengthening cuts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our implementation on the optimal design of water networks, robust trusses, and gas networks, in comparison to an approach in which the failure scenarios are directly included into the model.																			1055-6788	1029-4937				MAR 4	2023	38	2					356	385		10.1080/10556788.2022.2142581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10556788.2022.2142581		JAN 2023											WOS:000907249600001

The proposed method is based on the concept of parallel distributed compensators where the scheduling of the local model network is adopted for the PID parameters. The proposed design method for nonlinear PID controllers considers closed-loop stability by means of a Lyapunov stability criterion as well as closed-loop performance. All PID parameters are determined by a multi-objective genetic algorithm (multiGA), which handles the trade-off between stability and performance.

It describes the underlying behavior of packet delivery and provides insights into tuning protocols to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time Markov model to simulate the burstiness behavior of wireless links, which provides a novel approach for link burstiness studies. More specifically, we first present a discrete-time Markov model with the input of value and the output of a sequence trace of burstiness traffic. Then we design an algorithm to simulate the Markov model, where the state transition represents the packet receptions or losses. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model in terms of distribution of link burstiness, accuracy and cost, and the results demonstrate that our model is able to accurately simulate the burstiness behavior.

J	Liu, HX				Liu, Hongxi			Sustainable road network design considering hydrogen fuel cell vehicles	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Environmental pollution and energy shortages have brought about an increased focus on new energy vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) have experienced rapid development due to the potential to alleviate energy pressures and reduce pollution emissions. Near zero-carbon emissions offer a promising avenue for promoting sustainable transportation development. To evaluate the impact of HFCVs on the transportation environment, this paper investigates the problem of sustainable transportation network design including HFCVs. Specifically, the problem is formulated as a bi-level multi-objective programming problem, with the upper level aimed at determining the optimal network design scheme considering multiple objectives, while the lower level addresses the mixed traffic flow that comprises both HFCVs and fuel vehicles. To solve the multi-objective sustainable network design problem, an integrated solution framework that combines the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) is developed. Specifically, the PSO algorithm is utilized to solve the upper-level model and identify the optimal network design schemes, while FW algorithm is adopted to handle mixed traffic flow assignments. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are implemented in two numerical experiment to demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency.

Aiming at this problem, we propose a new adaptive strategy, in which both the adaptive-impulsive controller and the parameters adaptive laws are designed via the discrete-time signals from the drive system. The corresponding theoretical proof is given to guarantee the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Moreover, the concrete adaptive strategies are achieved for delayed Hopfield neural network, optical Ikeda system and the well-known delayed Lu chaotic system. As expected, numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

In short term, these range from achieving lowest ownership costs to preventing monopolies. In long term, project developers focus on how uncertainties of design parameters (e.g. demand/supply, heat prices) affect the grid design and, ultimately, the business case. Currently, heat grids are designed through the evaluation of manually drafted topologies. Since there are many design options and uncertainties in the parameters, it is infeasible to evaluate all possibilities, leading to suboptimal designs. In this paper, numerical optimization approaches will be discussed that can assist with the conceptual grid design in a systematic manner to achieve an improved network topology. It will be explained how uncertainty, for example of demands, can be addressed to obtain a robust network design. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

By considering sensor-to-FDF network-induced delays and packet dropouts, which do not impose a constraint on the event-triggering mechanism, and proposing the simultaneous network bandwidth utilization ratio and fault occurrence probability-based event-triggering mechanism, a new closed-loop model for the considered NCS is established. Based on the established model, the event-triggered H-infinity performance analysis, and FDF and controller coordinated design are presented. The combined mutually exclusive distribution and Wirtinger-based integral inequality approach is proposed for the first time to deal with integral inequalities for products of vectors. This approach is proved to be less conservative than the existing Wirtinger-based integral inequality approach. The designed FDF and controller can guarantee the sensitivity of the residual signal to faults and the robustness of the NCS to external disturbances.

Considering the time delay and external disturbance, we formulate the closed-loop event-triggered output tracking problem into a time-delayed discrete polytopic linear parameter-varying system with relative event-triggering mechanism. Then, by constructing the parameter-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, we derive a sufficient condition such that the closed-loop system is global asymptotic stable and satisfies the H-infinity output tracking performance. Further, we develop an approach to design the event-triggering mechanism and H-infinity output tracking controller. The parameters of event-triggering mechanism and the gains of output tracking controller are obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities.

The dynamic behavior of a group of traffic signals controlling a network of intersections is a complex discrete event system that can be modeled using Petri nets. In this paper, one purpose is to design a mechanism based on Petri nets with time interval associated to places to extend the green time to a main road depending on the demand of non-priority roads. Another objective is to try to allow green phases for a sequence of intersections in a small network in order to improve traffic flow for a platoon of vehicles.

In order to reduce energy consumption, a novel accumulation-based event-triggered mechanism (ABETM) is proposed to regulate the signal transmissions between the network outputs and the estimator. Compared with the traditional eventtriggered schemes, the ABETM is perceived to be more robust against unexpectedly abrupt changes of the signals that could occur due to measurement noises, sampling problems and unusual conditions. The objective of this paper is to design an H-infinity state estimator such that the error dynamics of the state estimation satisfies the prescribed H-infinity performance requirement on a finite horizon. A sufficient condition is first provided to guarantee the finite-horizon H-infinity performance of the state estimator by resorting to the Lyapunov stability theory. Then, the desired estimator gain is calculated by solving some matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the validity of the proposed estimator under the ABETM, where the advantages of the proposed ABETM are demonstrated as compared to the traditional event-triggered schemes.

The altitude subsystem is transformed into the explicit 4-step ahead prediction model with four 1-step ahead prediction subsequences. The control design is based on the state feedback and neural approximation. For each subsystem only one neural network is employed to approximate the lumped system uncertainty. The controller is considerably simpler than the ones based on back-stepping scheme. The velocity subsystem is transformed into the output feedback form and the indirect discrete NN controller is applied.

On Network Lifetime Expectancy With Realistic Sensing and Traffic Generation Model in Wireless Sensor Networks	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL												Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which are used in a wide variety of mission-critical applications, are comprised of sensor nodes with limited battery power. The feasibility of such applications is highly influenced by the longevity or sustainability of these networks. Improvement of energy efficiency and estimation of network lifetime are important issues in these energy constrained networks. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for estimating the network lifetime of a sensor network. The traffic generation model is designed for irregular surfaces while combining the Elfes sensing model and event generation model. A discrete radio model is considered in this paper for better energy efficiency. Two different scenarios, such as, single-hop and multi-hop networks are analyzed with the proposed model. The likelihood of achieving the desired network lifetime with the proposed model is examined. Extensive simulations are done taking the topology from real-sensor network testbeds. We also estimate the packet loss rates and the results also confirm the accuracy and energy efficiency of the proposed model.

J	Holmberg, K; Hellstrand, J				Holmberg, K; Hellstrand, J			Solving the uncapacitated network design problem by a Lagrangean heuristic and branch-and-bound	OPERATIONS RESEARCH												The network design problem is a multicommodity minimal cost network flow problem with fixed costs on the arcs, i.e., a structured linear mixed-integer programming problem. It has various applications, such as construction of new links in transportation networks, topological design of computer communication networks, and planning of empty freight car transportation on railways. We present a Lagrangean heuristic within a branch-and-bound framework as a method for finding the exact optimal solution of the uncapacitated network design problem with single origins and destinations for each commodity (the simplest problem in this class, but still NP-hard). The Lagrangean heuristic uses a Lagrangean relaxation as subproblem, solving the Lagrange dual with subgradient optimization, combined with a primal heuristic (the Benders subproblem) yielding primal feasible solutions. Computational tests on problems of various sizes (up to 1000 arcs, 70 nodes and 138 commodities or 40 nodes and 600 commodities) and of several different structures lead to the conclusion that the method is quite powerful, outperforming for example a state-of-the-art mixed-integer code, both with respect to problem size and solution time.

J	Jia, FL; He, X				Jia, Fanlin; He, Xiao			Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control for Discrete-Time Nonstrict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems With Stochastic Noises	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												This paper discusses the problem of fault-tolerant tracking control for discrete-time nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems in the presence of stochastic noises and actuator faults. The system is characterized by a discrete-time nonstrict-feedback structure and multiplicative stochastic noise related to the states, which poses a challenge for the design and analysis of the fault-tolerant controller. Moreover, the considered actuator faults include multiplicative and additive faults without prior information. By integrating the properties of the backstepping framework and neural networks, and by introducing an adaptive fault compensation term, a novel fault-tolerant tracking control strategy is proposed. The effects of faults are compensated and the difficulties caused by the system structure are overcome, avoiding the algebraic loop problem and overcoming the causal contradiction. Given specific parameters, the designed fault-tolerant controller can ensure that the tracking error converges to an adjustable region regarding the origin and that all system signals are uniformly bounded concerning the mean-square sense. The simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the designed fault-tolerant control method.Note to Practitioners-As system complexity has been increasing, practical systems are often affected by faults when performing tracking control. Fault-tolerant control can provide acceptable robustness and improve system safety. On the one hand, many practical systems are nonlinear, difficult to model mathematically and accurately, and affected by stochastic noises. On the other hand, with digital control, the object is a discrete-time system. In practical applications, the upper bounds of the faults and the noises are often unknown. In this paper, a novel adaptive fault-tolerant control method is proposed for the more general uncertain discrete-time nonlinear systems, i.e., nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems, with stochastic noises and actuator faults. Neural networks and an adaptive fault compensation term are integrated into the fault-tolerant controller. By adjusting the controller parameters properly, it is ensured that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero in the event of a fault occurring. In future research, sensor faults, input constraints, optimal control design, and applications in multi-agent systems will be considered.																			1545-5955	1558-3783				2023 JUN 5	2023										10.1109/TASE.2023.3278978	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2023.3278978		JUN 2023											WOS:001005941900001

To this end, the so-called Bernoulli random binary distribution is utilized to model the random time-varying delays. Then, by exploiting a specific sliding surface, a discrete-time sliding mode controller is designed such that the derived closed-loop system state and sliding function remain bounded in the presence of uncertainties and exogenous disturbances. Since the system state and sliding function are involved timevarying delays, the notion of exponentially mean square stability will be used to guarantee the stability/boundedness of the derived closed-loop system. The proposed robust DSMC can also overcome the conservatism of the existing methods in the literature. An illustrative example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The control schemes presented include both continuous pinning quantized controllers and intermittent pinning quantized controllers. Based on designed Lyapunov function and guaranteed cost finite-time pinning quantized techniques, sufficient conditions for the guaranteed cost intermittent pinning quantized and continuous pinning quantized control laws are formulated in terms of matrix inequalities. Meanwhile, the guaranteed cost is a nonlinear function, which can be addressed nonlinear programming algorithm.

Our approach addresses the mapping of video segments to glosses by introducing recurrent convolutional neural network for spatio-temporal feature extraction and sequence learning. We design a three-stage optimization process for our architecture. First, we develop an end-to-end sequence learning scheme and employ connectionist temporal classification (CTC) as the objective function for alignment proposal. Second, we take the alignment proposal as stronger supervision to tune our feature extractor. Finally, we optimize the sequence learning model with the improved feature representations, and design a weakly supervised detection network for regularization. We apply the proposed approach to a real-world continuous sign language recognition benchmark, and our method, with no extra supervision, achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art.

Along with device scaling, complex minimum-implant-area (MIA) constraints arise as an emerging challenge in modern circuit designs, adding to the difficulties in mixed-cell-height placement. Existing MIA-aware detailed placement with single-row-height standard cells is insufficient for mixed-cell-height designs: 1) filler insertion, typically used to resolve MIA violations, might incur unaffordable area and wirelength overheads and 2) mixed-height-cell perturbation could cause severe inter-row MIA violations. This article addresses the mixed-cell-height detailed placement problem considering both intra- and inter-row MIA constraints. We first fix intrarow violations by clustering violating mixed-height cells of the same threshold voltage, and then perturb each cluster to obtain a desired cell permutation by applying an efficient, optimal dynamic-programming-based algorithm for a special case and Algorithm DLX for general ones, where a provably constant performance ratio for a mixed-cell-height reshaping problem can be achieved. With a network-flow-based formulation, remaining violating cells are placed in appropriate filler-insertion positions to fix cell violations and minimize area. After performing mixed-cell-height detailed placement, we finally fix inter-row violations by shifting violating cells in minimum displacement. Experimental results show that our algorithm can efficiently solve all MIA violations without any extra area overhead.																			0278-0070	1937-4151				OCT	2021	40	10					2128	2141		10.1109/TCAD.2020.3032619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2020.3032619													WOS:000696668400017

An event-triggered scheme is proposed to determine whether the current data should be transmitted to the filter or not. Based on the time interval analysis approach, the discrete-time Markov jump system with network-induced delays under event-triggered communication scheme is converted into the discrete-time Markov jump time-delay system. By employing the positive-definite diagonally-dominant-type Lyapunov function technique, criteria are derived to guarantee the system is stochastically stable with a prescribed H-infinity performance level. The correspondent filter and the event-triggered parameters are also solved. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Departing from the common practice which firstly designs the consensus control under the delay-free assumption and then computes the maximally tolerated communication delay, we propose a new simple technique which allows us to achieve consensus for any communication delay for marginally stable agents. Our approach also achieves consensus for unstable agents, provided the time delay is within a certain range. Our consensus algorithm is designed under the usual assumptions of undirected connectivity for the network. The proposed consensus control law requires communication between neighboring agents only at certain sampling points, rather than at all times. The control law is also unique in the sense that it is nonlinear in the continuous time domain but linear when the agents are viewed in the sampled-data domain. The proposed technique is expected to pave a new way for new theoretical studies on network properties required for consensus control.

This paper proposes a bi-modal mixed traffic equilibrium model with capacity constraints under two cases: (1) the physical queuing case for both car and bus modes; (2) implementing a queuing toll policy only for car mode to eliminate physical queuing. Based on the method of successive averages, an improved bi-loop algorithm is designed to solve the model. By two classical networks, we compare the two proposed cases with the benchmark case without capacity constraints to analyze the impact of capacity constraints and queueing toll policy on travelers' travel cost and travel choice behavior.

In practice, the mix proportion of wet-mix shotcrete plays a key role in later successful application. To obtain an optimal mix proportion, a large number of trial physical experiments should be carried out. Therefore, in this paper, a new ANN-PSO model is proposed to obtain the mix proportion of wet-mix shotcrete quickly, precisely and economically. The artificial neural network (ANN) model was used to establish the objective functions for particle swarm optimization (PSO) optimization, while the PSO was adopted to optimize mix proportions of wet-mix shotcrete to achieve optimal objectives. This hybrid model was applied to optimize mix proportions of wet-mix shotcrete in the Jinchuan mine. The results revealed that the ANN model yielded a mean relative error (MRE) of 2.755% and an R-2 of 0.980, indicating an excellent prediction to establish the reasonable objective function. Additionally, PSO spent less than 60 s obtaining an optimal mix proportion of wet-mix shotcrete required by the mine. Consequently, this ANN-PSO model can be used as an efficient design guide to facilitate decision making, prior to the construction phase.

J	Tu, YK				Tu, Yu-Kang			Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models to Evaluate Inconsistency within a Network Meta-Analysis	VALUE IN HEALTH												Background: Network meta-analysis compares multiple treatments by incorporating direct and indirect evidence into a general statistical framework. One issue with the validity of network meta-analysis is inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence within a loop formed by three treatments. Recently, the inconsistency issue has been explored further and a complex design-by-treatment interaction model proposed. Objective: The aim of this article was to show how to evaluate the design-by-treatment interaction model using the generalized linear mixed model. Methods: We proposed an arm based approach to evaluating the design-by-treatment inconsistency, which is flexible in modeling different types of outcome variables. We used the smoking cessation data to compare results from our arm based approach with those from the standard contrast-based approach. Results: Because the contrast-based approach requires transformation of data, our example showed that such a transformation may yield biases in the treatment effect and inconsistency evaluation, when event rates were low in some treatments. We also compared contrast-based and arm-based models in the evaluation of design inconsistency when different heterogeneity variances were estimated, and the arm-based model yielded more accurate results. Conclusions: Because some statistical software commands can detect the collinearity among variables and automatically remove the redundant ones, we can use this advantage to help with placing the inconsistency parameters. This could be very useful for a network meta-analysis involving many designs and treatments.

A finite state Markov process is used to model communication delays between sensors and controllers, and the transition probabilities are not assumed to be completely known, that is, it can be partly known. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a novel methodology for designing a partially mode delay dependent state feedback controller has been proposed. The partially mode delay dependent controller is obtained by solving linear matrix inequality optimization problems using the cone complementarity linearization algorithm. We shown that the existing results for networked control systems with random communication delays modeled by completely known or completely unknown transition probabilities can be viewed as a special case of the proposal results. The effectiveness of the proposed design methodology is verified by a numerical example.

Firstly, through system transformation, the original system is replaced with a prediction model that can avoid non causal problems caused by the use of future information in the current step. By using action-critic network, an adaptive control method is put forward to offset the influence of hysteresis.

Based on some relatively simple threshold constants, three levels of event conditions are set and thus the ETIC scheme is designed. Three cases for ETIC with and without time-delays and data dropouts are studied respectively, and the criteria on exponential stability are derived for the controlled DDS. The stabilization in the form of exponential stability is achieved for DDS under the designed ETIC with or without time-delays. And in the case of the ETIC data dropouts, the conditions of exponential stabilization are derived for DDS and the maximal allowable dropout rates for ETIC are estimated.

J	Parashar, R; Reeves, DM				Parashar, Rishi; Reeves, Donald M.			On iterative techniques for computing flow in large two-dimensional discrete fracture networks	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												Computation of flow in discrete fracture networks often involves solving for hydraulic head values at all intersection points of a large number of stochastically generated fractures inside a bounded domain. For large systems, this approach leads to the generation of problems involving highly sparse matrices which must be solved iteratively. Distributions of fracture lengths spanning over several orders of magnitude, and the randomness of fracture orientations and locations, lead to coefficient matrices that are devoid of any regular structure in the sparsity pattern. In addition to the rapid increase in computational effort with increase in the size of the fracture network, the spread in the distribution of fracture parameters, such as length and transmissivity, dramatically influences the convergence behavior of the system of linear equations. An overview of the discrete fracture network (DFN) methodology for computation of flow is presented along with a comparative study of various Krylov subspace iterative methods for the resulting class of sparse matrices. The rate of convergence of the iterative techniques is found to exhibit a systematic pattern with respect to changes in statistical parameters of the stochastically generated fracture networks. Salient features of the observed trends in the convergence pattern are discussed and guidelines for design of DFN algorithms are provided. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that the proposed FxTFNN and MFxTFNN have fixed -time convergence properties and their settling -time functions are independent of the initial values. The proposed FxTFNN and MFxTFNN can be used to solve the Lasso problem and apply sparse signal reconstruction and image reconstruction. In addition, by introducing time -varying coefficients based on FxTFNN and MFxTFNN, timevarying FxTFNN (TFxTFNN) and time -varying MFxTFNN (TMFxTFNN) are developed.

Most such systems are also time critical leading to safety and time critical systems. Safety standards impose strong requirements on such systems challenging system performance and cost. Very often, however, only part of the functions is safety and time critical calling for a design approach that both meets the safety requirements and provides efficiency and flexibility for less critical functions. These conflicting requirements have given rise to the new research area of mixed critical system design with enormous practical relevance. The tutorial addresses key aspects of mixed critical system design. The tutorial starts with a short introduction to the topic summarizing requirements and challenges of mixed critical system design. The first lecture by Alan Burns gives an overview of scheduling issues in mixed critical systems and explains first solutions. The second lecture by Lothar Thiele ad-dresses the lack of multicore timing predictability which challenges mixed critical systems integration and proposes a solution based on reducing timing variation. The third lecture by Rolf Ernst and Jimmy Le Rhun explains integration solutions based on switched networks and presents a scalable manycore architecture for mixed critical systems integration.

Discrete-time H<sub>∞</sub> output feedback for Markov jump systems with uncertain transition probabilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												This article addresses the H output feedback control for discrete-time Markov jump linear systems. With fully known transition probability, sufficient conditions for an internal model based controller design are obtained. For the case where the transition probabilities are uncertain and belong to a convex polytope with known vertices, we provide a sufficient LMI condition that guarantees the H norm of the closed-loop system is below a prescribed level. That condition can be improved through an iterative procedure. Additionally, we are able to deal with the case of cluster availability of the Markov mode, provided that some system matrices do not vary within a given cluster, an assumption that is suitable to deal with packet dropout models for networked control systems. A numerical example shows the applicability of the design and compares it with previous results. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

For discrete-time general nonlinear systems, the iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is developed and proved to guarantee the property of convergence and optimality. Three networks are constructed, namely, the identification network, critic network and action network. Moreover, a globalized dual heuristic programming technique with detailed implementation is developed. The cost function and its derivative can be approximated by this novel architecture. Besides, without the consideration of the system dynamics, this technique can learn the near-optimal control law simultaneously and adaptively. In addition, this technique greatly improves the existing results of the iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm in terms of reducing the requirement of the control matrix. Furthermore, because of the approach that is based on the multi-dimensional Taylor network, the amount of calculation needed is also greatly reduced.

A large number of properties like physico-chemical properties, thermodynamic properties, chemical activity and biological activity are determined by the chemical applications of graph theory. These properties can be characterized by certain graph invariants referred to as topological indices. A molecular descriptor (topological index) is a numerical representation of a chemical structure which correlates certain physico-chemical characteristics of underlying chemical compounds besides its numerical representation.

Design of a global discrete-time sliding mode control scheme for a class of nonlinear systems with state delays and uncertainties	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												This paper proposes a discrete-time sliding mode control design for a class of discrete-time dynamic systems with time delays, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances. The robust design implements an adaptive discrete-time reaching law in order to reduce the effect of the chattering phenomena and improve system robustness. It also considers a lumped disturbance function for the unknown parameters and time-delayed terms in order to estimate both at the same time. Additionally, the proposed sliding function ensures that the states of the control system are put on the switching surface right from the beginning, thus eliminating the reaching phase. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme was assessed using the longitudinal and lateral dynamics of an Osprey plane model. The obtained results indicated that the proposed approach guarantees system stability and ensures excellent tracking performance in the simultaneous presence of time delays, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances.

Wars, pandemics, and cyber-attacks have disrupted and rippled recently through these networks. The ripple effect in interdependent networks can be caused by functional and structural failures simultaneously, known as mixed ripple effects, which have been studied less in the past. To help managers enhance network resilience against mixed ripple effects, we propose a design and protection strategy from a network structure perspective. This paper is the first to propose a growth-maturity-decline (GMD) model for designing an interdependent network structure. Then, a protection strategy based on node collaboration and redundancy is proposed. Considering that a single resilience metric makes it difficult to distinguish the performance of different strategies, we develop a three-dimensional quantitative framework to evaluate network resilience by conducting case studies on synthetic and real-life supply chain networks. The simulation results indicate that (i) the GMD model enhances network resilience at different phases; (ii) the threshold of the upper capacity limit parameter for cyber-supply networks is 2.7; and (iii) the more uniform the role distribution of firms, the more resilient the network is. This study can provide more informed management decision support for improving network resilience.

Constraints of both rapid and complete mixing place considerable demands on mixer performance. Especially for those liquids with high viscosities and low diffusivities, mixing is particularly important, however, difficult, for processes associated with chemical reaction. A design of a mixer using a network of microchannels to split and recombine the flow repeatedly is introduced in the paper. Such a mixer has been incorporated by the authors into a device for carrying out measurements of chemical reaction kinetics in ionic liquid solutions. Rapid mixing of reagent solutions is required to produce a uniform reaction mixture in a time that is short compared to the kinetic time scales of interest. Since the ionic liquids have low molecular diffusivities and high viscosities, and for practical conditions, flow is necessarily in the Stokes regime (Re<1), this liquid system provides ail extremely challenge for mixer design. The performance of the mixer is then investigated by experiments.						Staijen, Erik/0000-0001-8682-4366															978-0-7918-4864-7				2008							591	595																WOS:000266598100069

The dynamic concentration gradient formed from mixing equal inlet flow rates of (0.01-1.5 mol/kg) sucrose solution with deionized water in a network was analytically modelled and experimentally investigated. The generation of a stable profile was highly dependent on both the inlet flow rate and the inlet viscosity ratio of the mixed solutions for each case study. The optimum flow rate per inlet for a stable profile was also determined. The experimental investigations show that optimizing the diffusion rate and providing sufficient mixing are key parameters to validate the analytical model. An inlet viscosity ratio of >1.009:1 (with respect to water inlet) was sufficient to perturb the outlet concentration profile. The linearity of the outlet concentration profile decreased and tended towards a sigmoidal profile with increasing sucrose concentration. Enhanced linearity of the outlet concentration profile, through optimizing the inlet flow rate ratio for each case study was also performed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the late 1990s a number of researchers noticed that networks in biology, sociology, and telecommunications exhibited similar characteristics unlike traditional random networks. Three properties-small-world, power law, and constant clustering coefficient-describe what are now most commonly referred to as scale-free networks. How do scale-free networks form? It is well documented that a network generated by adding nodes and edges preferentially will be scale-free. Are there other mechanisms? Why do networks organize themselves in this way? What causes a scale-free network to degrade? The focus of our research is to understand what drives a collection of nodes to organize as a scale-free network. Furthermore, once a network is scale-free what disrupts this apparently natural structure. To answer these questions we build a discrete-event simulation, nominally of an air transport system. The simulation is written in C.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	3-540-26032-3				2005	3514						1051	1058																WOS:000230414400131

Recent research proposes that differences in social mixing by sex could alter infection patterns in TB. We examine evidence for two mechanisms by which social-mixing could increase men's contact rates with TB cases. First, men could be positioned in social networks such that they contact more people or social groups. Second, preferential mixing by sex could prime men to have more exposure to TB cases. Methods We compared the networks of male and female TB cases and healthy matched controls living in Kampala, Uganda. Specifically, we estimated their positions in social networks (network distance to TB cases, degree, betweenness, and closeness) and assortativity patterns (mixing with adult men, women, and children inside and outside the household). Results The observed network consisted of 11,840 individuals. There were few differences in estimates of node position by sex. We found distinct mixing patterns by sex and TB disease status including that TB cases have proportionally more adult male contacts and fewer contacts with children. Conclusions This analysis used a network approach to study how social mixing patterns are associated with TB disease. Understanding these mechanisms may have implications for designing targeted intervention strategies in high-burden populations.

Firstly, the systems are transformed into a causal state space description, adaptive state feedback NN control is presented based on Lyapunov's stability theory. Then, by converting the systems into a causal input output representation, adaptive output feedback NN control is given. Finally, adaptive NN observer design and observer-based adaptive control are presented under the assumption of persistent excitation ( PE). All the control schemes avoid the so-called controller singularity problem in adaptive control.

In ADTIZD models, Adams-Bashforth discrete formulas as novel discrete formulas are used, giving our ADTIZD models higher accuracy [truncation error being O(tau(5))] but less time and space complexity than the ordinary multi-instant models. Enhanced by the integration part, the ADTIZD models can resist large additive noises, where even constant noises cannot decrease their precision. All convergence and robustness performance conclusions about our ADTIZD models are supported by rigorous theoretical proofs and numerical experiments. More comparisons between ADTIZD models and other discrete-time zeroing neural network models are shown in these experiments too. The efficacy of ADTIZD models is finally been validated in the simulation of adopting them in controlling a robotic manipulator.

We review existing research on optical network design and control and present some open challenges. One of the important open challenges lies in multilayer resource optimization including IT and optical network resources. We propose an adaptive joint optimization method of IT resources and optical spectrum under time -varying traffic demand in optical networks while avoiding an increase in operation cost. We formulate the problem as mixed integer linear programming and then quantitatively evaluate the trade-off relationship between the optimality of reconfiguration and operation cost.

Also, high quality of service is required and this requirement results a sudden network traffic increment. As a result, an efficient management system for huge network traffic becomes an important issue. Ontology/data engineering based context awareness using the System Entity Structure (SES) concepts enables network administrators to access traffic data easily and efficiently.

Firstly, an event-triggered threshold is set by using both state and state-independent informations in the mixed ETM. Then the event-triggered NCSs with network-induced time-varying delays which exist in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels are modeled as a general time-delay system. Based on the piecewise differentiable characteristic of the time-varying delay and by using the approach of free weighting matrix and reciprocally convex, a less conservative criterion to be globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) stability and a controller design method are derived. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed to obtain the desired mixed ETM and state-feedback controller which can render the network load and control performance to reach an expected level. Compared with the relative and absolute ETMs, the proposed mechanism can effectively improve the transmission efficiency during the whole working time. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Due to the role of resource utilization as a key component of logistics network design, another primary goal of design is ensuring available scarce resources are used as efficiently as possible across all facilities. To address efficiency issues in a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network, a stochastic integrated multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed in this paper, in which sustainability outcomes as well as efficiency of facility resource utilization are considered in the design of a sustainable supply chain network. In doing so, efficiency is assessed using a bi-objective output-oriented data envelopment analysis model. A hybrid three-step solution methodology is presented that creates a linear form of the original mixed integer nonlinear programming problem using piecewise McCormick envelopes approach. In the second step, an aggregated single objective programming model is derived by exploiting the multi-choice goal programming. Finally, a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to effectively solve the latter stochastic single objective mixed integer linear programming problem. The application of the proposed approach is investigated with data drawn from a case study in the electronics industry. This case study illustrates how firms may balance sustainability and efficiency in the supply chain network design problem. Further, it demonstrates the integration of efficiency results in improving economic aspects of sustainability as well as social responsibility outcomes, but also highlights the trade-offs that exist between efficiency and environmental impacts.

We present a mixed integer program formulation for this approach for a fluid network whose nominal traffic intensity is less than one at each station. This is a generalization of the work of Chen & Yao. As an application, we also provide a sufficient condition for the nonexistence of a stable static priority rule based upon the linear program relaxation.																			1948-9439		978-1-4244-8736-3				2011							4379	4382																WOS:000323234702294

A transmission model, dependent on a Bernoulli distributed white sequence, is developed to describe the phenomenon of deception attacks. In light of the adopted protocol and the attack model, a recursive algorithm with the form of Riccati-like difference equations is developed to optimize the filtering performance in the mean square sense. Furthermore, by resorting to the mathematical induction, the convergence of the proposed recursive algorithm is discussed profoundly.

With the received signals transmitted through common communication channels, a network-based observer is designed to estimate the state variables of a positive system. To save the limited communication bandwidth, a novel event generator is constructed in the network-based observer framework. In the established network-based models, nonlinear functions satisfying Lipschitz condition are considered and the probabilistic distribution of networked transmission delays is described by a Bernoulli distributed sequence. By constructing linear Lyapunov functions, a criterion ensuring the existence of the l(1)-gain observer is proposed. And a linear programming method to compute the gain matrix of the desired observer is provided. The effectiveness of derived results are demonstrated by two numerical examples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

First, a dynamic event-triggered scheme and a static event-triggered scheme on sensor and controller sides are proposed, respectively, to reduce the number of unnecessary data transmission. Then, an observer is designed to estimate the system state. Considering the effects of quantization, networked conditions, external disturbance and event-triggered transmission schemes, the state error system and sliding mode dynamics are modeled as a new networked time-delay system. Based on this model and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the resulting closed-loop system to be asymptotically stable with prescribed H-infinity performance. And then, a co-design method is present to obtain the observer gain, triggering parameter and sliding mode parameter, simultaneously. Furthermore, a sliding mode controller for reaching motion is developed to ensure the reachability of the sliding surface. Finally, simulation examples are present to verify the effective of the proposed design method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We consider networked systems consisting of subsystems with higher-order discrete-time linear time-invariant dynamics. We show that the average controllability is a monotone increasing supermodular function of a set of links in the networked system. Since maximizing such a function with cardinality constraints is an NP-hard problem, we analyze the performance guarantees obtained from the greedy algorithm for maximizing non-submodular set functions in terms of supermodular curvature. We show that the lower bound obtained for the greedy algorithm becomes trivial as the number of subsystems in the networked system increases. Hence, we propose two heuristic algorithms to solve the optimization problem and numerically demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed heuristics in terms of computational complexity and performance improvement in average controllability.

However, the application of CPM is limited by the demodulation and the strict requirements of synchronization. A novel method based on the convolution neural network (CNN) is proposed for binary partial response CPM signals, where the structure of the neural network is designed according to the traditional demodulation processing. Specifically, the convolution kernels are applied to extract the high-dimensional features, which are different from the branch metrics calculated by the matched filters and phase rotation. And then the extracted features are mapped in the fully-connected layers, which plays the same role as the Viterbi decoder. Besides, the moving step of the convolution kernels is small, so that the extracted features can obtain more information than the branch metrics, even though there are some timing errors. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method approaches that of the theoretical optimal method. Moreover, the designed network is robust to normalized timing variance with no extra training.

However, the majority of existing traffic flow prediction models are tailored to static traffic networks and fail to model the continuous evolution and expansion of traffic networks. In this work, we move to investigate the challenge of traffic flow prediction on an evolving traffic network. And we propose an efficient and effective continual learning framework to achieve continuous traffic flow prediction without the access to historical graph data, namely Pattern Expansion and Consolidation based on Pattern Matching (PECPM). Specifically, we first design a bank module based on pattern matching to store representative patterns of the road network. With the expansion of the road network, the model configured with such a bank module can achieve continuous traffic prediction by effectively managing patterns stored in the bank. The core idea is to continuously update new patterns while consolidating learned ones. Specifically, we design a pattern expansion mechanism that can detect evolved and new patterns from the updated network, then these unknown patterns are expanded into the pattern bank to adapt to the updated road network. Additionally, we propose a pattern consolidation mechanism that includes both a bank preservation mechanism and a pattern traceability mechanism. This can effectively consolidate the learned patterns in the bank without requiring access to detailed historical graph data. Finally, we construct experiments on real-world traffic datasets to demonstrate the competitive performance, superior efficiency, and strong generalization ability of PECPM.

In this paper, to solve the problem in image processing of corneal endothelium, we propose a method to get a well generalized shift-invariant neural network by designing optimal weights between the input and first hidden layers. The neural network has weight patterns between each layer, and its signal propagation is calculated by discrete convolution between the weight patterns and data in lower layers. The optimal weights between the input and first hidden layer are designed by observing the training set distribution in the vector space. The designed weights transform the training set to cover the whole input domain. In the learning process, the designed weights are fixed and the other weights are updated. In the experiment, well generalized neural networks are obtained.																			0893-6080	1879-2782				MAR	1996	9	2					345	356		10.1016/0893-6080(95)00054-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0893-6080(95)00054-2													WOS:A1996UC57100014

J	Ziolkowski, P; Niedostatkiewicz, M; Kang, SB				Ziolkowski, Patryk; Niedostatkiewicz, Maciej; Kang, Shao-Bo			Model-Based Adaptive Machine Learning Approach in Concrete Mix Design	MATERIALS												Concrete mix design is one of the most critical issues in concrete technology. This process aims to create a concrete mix which helps deliver concrete with desired features and quality. Contemporary requirements for concrete concern not only its structural properties, but also increasingly its production process and environmental friendliness, forcing concrete producers to use both chemically and technologically complex concrete mixtures. The concrete mix design methods currently used in engineering practice are joint analytical and laboratory procedures derived from the Three Equation Method and do not perform well enough for the needs of modern concrete technology. This often causes difficulties in predicting the final properties of the designed mix and leads to precautionary oversizing of concrete properties for fear of not providing the required parameters. A new approach that would make it possible to predict the newly designed concrete mix properties is highly desirable. The answer to this challenge can be methods based on machine learning, which have been intensively developed in recent years, especially in predicting concrete compressive strength. Machine learning-based methods have been more or less successful in predicting concrete compressive strength, but they do not reflect well the variability that characterises the currently used concrete mixes. A new adaptive solution that allows estimating concrete compressive strength on the basis of the concrete mix main ingredient composition by including two observations for a given batch of concrete is proposed herein. In presented study, a machine learning model was built with a deep neural network architecture, trained on an extensive database of concrete recipes, and translated into a mathematical formula. Testing on four concrete mix recipes was performed, which were calculated according to contemporary design methods (Bolomey and Fuller method), and a comparative analysis was conducted. It was found out that the new algorithm performs significantly better than that without adaptive features trained on the same dataset. The presented algorithm can be used as a concrete strength checking tool for the concrete mix design process.

J	Savran, A				Savran, Aydogan			Discrete state space modeling and control of nonlinear unknown systems	ISA TRANSACTIONS												A novel procedure for integrating neural networks (NNs) with conventional techniques is proposed to design industrial modeling and control systems for nonlinear unknown systems. In the proposed approach, a new recurrent NN with a special architecture is constructed to obtain discrete-time state-space representations of nonlinear dynamical systems. It is referred as the discrete state-space neural network (DSSNN). In the DSSNN, the outputs of the hidden layer neurons of the DSSNN represent the system's (pseudo) state. The inputs are fed to output neurons and the delayed outputs of the hidden layer neurons are fed to their inputs via adjustable weights. The discrete state space model of the actual system is directly obtained by training the DSSNN with the input-output data. A training procedure based on the back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm is developed. The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method with a trust region approach is used to update the DSSNN weights. Linear state space models enable to use well developed conventional analysis and design techniques. Thus, building a linear model of a system has primary importance in industrial applications. Thus, a suitable linearization procedure is proposed to derive the linear state space model from the nonlinear DSSNN representation. The controllability, observability and stability properties are examined. The state feedback controllers are designed with both the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and the pole placement techniques. The regulator and servo control problems are both addressed. A full order observer is also designed to estimate the state variables. The performance of the proposed procedure is demonstrated by applying for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear control problems. (C) 2013 ISA.

N.; Rao, Rathnamala			Design and Verification of an Asynchronous NoC Router Architecture for GALS Systems	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC TESTING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												The increasing multi-core system complexity with technology scaling introduces new constraints and challenges to interconnection network design. Consequently, the research community has a converging trend toward an asynchronous design paradigm for Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture as a promising solution to these challenges. This paper addresses the design and functional verification aspects of an asynchronous NoC router microarchitecture for a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) system. Firstly, the paper introduces a novel mixed-level abstract simulation approach for faster functional verification of the asynchronous architecture using the commercially available Spectre Analog and mixed-signal simulation (AMS) Designer tool. This simulation methodology intends to ensure the feasibility of the design and identify shortcomings, if any, before the subsequent implementation stages of the design. Also, the paper proposes a new baseline asynchronous router built on a domino logic pipeline template with a novel hybrid encoding scheme. The new hybrid encoding scheme facilitates simple architecture with no additional timing constraints. The proposed verification methodology evaluates the baseline asynchronous router's functional verification in Cadence's AMS designer tool. Preliminary simulation results conform to the objectives of the paper. Further, the same verification setup establishes the design validation in subsequent stages of the design implementation.

Aerodynamic analysis is performed using a commercial code, ANSYS-CFX 15.0, to solve three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with a shear stress transport turbulence model. The stall margin of the centrifugal compressor is used as the objective function, and three geometric parameters associated with the shape of the discrete cavities (the width and angle of the cavity port, and the axial distance between cavities) were selected as design variables. The Latin hypercube sampling method is used to compose the design space with 27 design points, and a radial basis neural network model is constructed as a surrogate model of the objective function. The optimization results show that the stall margin of the centrifugal compressor with the optimum discrete cavities is improved by 15.4% compared to the compressor without cavity.

The discrete-time HJB equation is formulated using a suitable non-quadratic term in the performance functional to tackle constraints on the control input. Based on the non-quadratic functional, a greedy HDP algorithm is used to obtain the constrained robust-optimal controller. The constrained robust controller requires knowledge of the upper bound of system uncertainties. For facilitating the implementation of the iterative algorithm, two neural networks are used to approximate the value function and to compute the optimal control policy, respectively. Their weights have been tuned using least squares method. Proposed algorithm has been applied on a nonlinear discrete-time system with matched uncertainties.

The fuzzy neural network is used as a function approximator to compensate the unknown certainty equivalent controller. The problem of function approximation error is solved by a technique of time-varying boundary layer. This boundary layer is then utilized to construct an auxiliary error function for the design of adaptive laws. In order to achieve a desired learning performance, the FNN parameter and the width of boundary layer will be tuned during the iteration processes. Based on a Lyapunov-like analysis, we show that all adjustable parameters as well as the internal signals remain bounded for all iterations and the output tracking error will asymptotically converge to a residual set whose size depends on the width of boundary layer as iteration goes to infinity.																			2474-2953		978-1-4673-1872-3; 978-1-4673-1871-6				2012							447	451																WOS:000317972500078

To maximize the positive impact on the environment by integrating GSCM factors in RL (second objective function). To calculate the efficiency of disassembly centers by SDEA method, which are selected as suppliers and maximize the total efficiency (third objective function). To evaluate the resources and total efficiency of the proposed model to facilitate the allocation resource process, to increase resource efficiency and to improve the efficiency of disassembly centers by Inverse DEA. Design/methodology/approach The design of a closed-loop logistics network for after-sales service for mobile phones and digital cameras has been developed by the mixed-integer linear programming method (MILP). Development of MILP method has been performed by simultaneously considering three main objectives including: total network profit, green supply chain factors (environmental sustainability) and maximizing the efficiency of disassembly centers. The proposed model of study is a six-level, multi-objective, single-period and multi-product that focuses on electrical waste. The efficiency of product return centers is calculated by SDEA method and the most efficient centers are selected. Findings The results of using the model in a case mining showed that, due to the use of green factors in network design, environmental pollution and undesirable disposal of some electronic waste were reduced. Also, with the reduction of waste disposal, valuable materials entered the market cycle and the network profit increased.

We consider two variants of this problem depending on the topology of the network through which the servers are connected: a mesh topology and a tree topology.

The Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) allows for the providers to partition the traffic in the network and assign it to different virtual local area networks, each satisfying the STP. In this manner, it is possible to make a more efficient use of the physical resources in the network. In this paper, we consider the traffic engineering problem of finding optimal designs of switched Ethernet networks implementing the MSTP, such that the worst-case link utilization is minimized. We show that this problem is N P-hard. We propose three mixed-integer linear programming formulations for this problem. Through a large set of computational experiments, we compare the performance of these formulations. Until now, the problem was almost exclusively solved with heuristics. Our objective here is providing a first comparison of different models that can be used in exact methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, a well-designed model structure is proposed to integrate two dynamic quantizers and an improved dynamic event-triggered protocol into a unified framework to reduce the amount of data in the network transmission and rationalize the use of limited network communication bandwidth resources. Especially, the event-triggering threshold parameter can be continuously adjusted over the time based on the fluctuation of the network signal. Second, a novel triple-cyber-attacks platform is established, of which including random deception attacks, random replay attacks and aperiodic DoS attacks. And with help of the extended decoupling strategy and iterative techniques, the co-design conditions of the stochastic admissibility with a P level of Script capital H & INFIN;$$ {\mathscr{H}}_{\infty } $$ performance are derived for the fault filtering error systems. Finally, two examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

Graph-based methods for discrete choice	NETWORK SCIENCE												Choices made by individuals have widespread impacts-for instance, people choose between political candidates to vote for, between social media posts to share, and between brands to purchase-moreover, data on these choices are increasingly abundant. Discrete choice models are a key tool for learning individual preferences from such data. Additionally, social factors like conformity and contagion influence individual choice. Traditional methods for incorporating these factors into choice models do not account for the entire social network and require hand-crafted features. To overcome these limitations, we use graph learning to study choice in networked contexts. We identify three ways in which graph learning techniques can be used for discrete choice: learning chooser representations, regularizing choice model parameters, and directly constructing predictions from a network. We design methods in each category and test them on real-world choice datasets, including county-level 2016 US election results and Android app installation and usage data. We show that incorporating social network structure can improve the predictions of the standard econometric choice model, the multinomial logit. We provide evidence that app installations are influenced by social context, but we find no such effect on app usage among the same participants, which instead is habit-driven. In the election data, we highlight the additional insights a discrete choice framework provides over classification or regression, the typical approaches. On synthetic data, we demonstrate the sample complexity benefit of using social information in choice models.

The new DRNN design involves a two-stage training process that couples an efficient forward model selection technique with gradient-based optimization. In the first stage, an impact recurrent network structure is obtained by a fast recursive algorithm in a stepwise forward procedure. To ensure stability, update rules are further developed using Lyapunov stability criterion to tune parameters of reduced size model at the second stage. The proposed approach is tested with an experimental regression problem and a practical HPCMHS identification, and the results are compared with four typical network models. The results show that the new design demonstrates improved accuracy and model compactness with reduced computational complexity over the existing methods.

The effectiveness of a health post network depends on factors such as the number and location of health posts. The service quality in such networks can be improved by controlling the amount of congestion at the facilities. An important policy for decreasing operational cost of these networks is to consider a workforce mix of flexible and dedicated servers. This paper integrates the network design with workforce cross-training in the presence of congestion, where the queuing system at each health post is modeled by a set of multi-class M/G/m queues offering multiple service types. The problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming model, and a linearization method is used to solve it. A hypothetical case study illustrates how the model can be used, and interesting managerial insights are presented. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rolls, K; Hansen, M; Jackson, D; Elliott, D				Rolls, Kaye; Hansen, Margaret; Jackson, Debra; Elliott, Doug			How Health Care Professionals Use Social Media to Create Virtual Communities: An Integrative Review	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH												Background: Prevailing health care structures and cultures restrict intraprofessional communication, inhibiting knowledge dissemination and impacting the translation of research into practice. Virtual communities may facilitate professional networking and knowledge sharing in and between health care disciplines. Objectives: This study aimed to review the literature on the use of social media by health care professionals in developing virtual communities that facilitate professional networking, knowledge sharing, and evidence-informed practice. Methods: An integrative literature review was conducted to identify research published between 1990 and 2015. Search strategies sourced electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL), snowball references, and tables of contents of 3 journals. Papers that evaluated social media use by health care professionals (unless within an education framework) using any research design (except for research protocols or narrative reviews) were included. Standardized data extraction and quality assessment tools were used. Results: Overall, 72 studies were included: 44 qualitative (including 2 ethnographies, 26 qualitative descriptive, and 1 Q-sort) and 20 mixed-methods studies, and 8 literature reviews. The most common methods of data collection were Web-based observation (n= 39), surveys (n= 23), interviews (n= 11), focus groups (n= 2), and diaries (n= 1). Study quality was mixed. Social media studied included Listservs (n= 22), Twitter (n= 18), general social media (n= 17), discussion forums (n= 7), Web 2.0 (n= 3), virtual community of practice (n= 3), wiki (n= 1), and Facebook (n= 1). A range of health care professionals were sampled in the studies, including physicians (n= 24), nurses (n= 15), allied health professionals (n= 14), followed by health care professionals in general (n= 8), a multidisciplinary clinical specialty area (n= 9), and midwives (n= 2). Of 36 virtual communities, 31 were monodiscipline for a discrete clinical specialty. Population uptake by the target group ranged from 1.6% to 29% (n= 4). Evaluation using related theories of "planned behavior" and the "technology acceptance model" (n= 3) suggests that social media use is mediated by an individual's positive attitude toward and accessibility of the media, which is reinforced by credible peers. The most common reason to establish a virtual community was to create a forum where relevant specialty knowledge could be shared and professional issues discussed (n= 17). Most members demonstrated low posting behaviors but more frequent reading or accessing behaviors. The most common Web-based activity was request for and supply of specialty-specific clinical information. This knowledge sharing is facilitated by a Web-based culture of collectivism, reciprocity, and a respectful noncompetitive environment. Findings suggest that health care professionals view virtual communities as valuable knowledge portals for sourcing clinically relevant and quality information that enables them to make more informed practice decisions. Conclusions: There is emerging evidence that health care professionals use social media to develop virtual communities to share domain knowledge. These virtual communities, however, currently reflect tribal behaviors of clinicians that may continue to limit knowledge sharing. Further research is required to evaluate the effects of social media on knowledge distribution in clinical practice and importantly whether patient outcomes are significantly improved.

J	Ni, N; Wu, HL; Zhang, LB				Ni, Ning; Wu, Hanlin; Zhang, Libao			Hierarchical Feature Aggregation and Self-Learning Network for Remote Sensing Image Continuous-Scale Super-Resolution	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Conducting research on remote sensing image (RSI) super-resolution (SR) is important, especially in terms of the continuous scale, which is beneficial to the application of RSI, such as RSI object detection and data fusion. Continuous-scale SR aims to use a single model to achieve SR at arbitrary (integer and noninteger) scale factors. Therefore, in this letter, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation and self-learning network for RSI continuous-scale SR (RSI-HFAS). Our network can magnify the RSI continuously, which is beneficial for extracting the RSI multiscale features. First, we design a hierarchical feature aggregation module (HFAM) that is used for hierarchical feature extraction by placing convolutional layers on different floors and completing global feature fusion, which is crucial for achieving RSI continuous-scale SR with a single model. Second, the proposed network introduces a feedback mechanism, which can refine the hierarchical feature through feature feedback and enrich the texture parts of the RSI step by step. Finally, we design a self-learning upscaling structure to dynamically predict the number and weights of the upsampling filters, which can achieve RSI continuous-scale SR. Compared to the meta-learning based on enhanced deep SR (META-EDSR) method, our experimental results show a nearly 0.2-dB improvement on the metrics of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).					wu, hanlin/HJH-5114-2023	wu, hanlin/0000-0002-3505-0521; Ni, Ning/0000-0001-7658-7942													1545-598X	1558-0571					2022	19								8023505	10.1109/LGRS.2021.3122985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2021.3122985													WOS:000742225800035

First, a novel condition of obtaining stochastic input-to-state stability (SISS) of discrete version is skillfully established. Then, the event-triggered control strategy is devised, and a near-optimal control policy is designed using an identifier-actor-critic neural networks (NNs) with an event-sampled state vector. Above all, an adaptive static event sampling condition is designed by using the Lyapunov technique to ensure ultimate boundedness (UB) for the closed-loop system. However, since the static event-triggered rule only depends on the current state, regardless of previous values, this article presents an explicit dynamic event-triggered rule. Furthermore, we prove that the lower bound of sampling interval for the proposed dynamic event-triggered control strategy is greater than one, which avoids the so-called triviality phenomenon. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed near-optimal control pattern is verified by a simulation example.					song, potato/HHC-9050-2022	Luo, Yanhong/0000-0001-6898-7903													2162-237X	2162-2388				OCT	2023	34	10					7299	7308		10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3140478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3140478		JAN 2022						35038299					WOS:000745439000001

For this aim the first step was to create a DES model of the network including five public hospital EDs using AnyLogic simulation software c. This model was used to create earthquake related scenarios. Then, a design of experiments (DOE) was conducted in order to examine the effect of the main factors on the performance measures (PMs) of patient average length of stay (LOS) in the ED and utilization of resources. A generalized full factorial design was performed where these simulated model factors were (1) the rate of estimated casualties depending on the earthquake magnitude and earthquake time, (2) routing probabilities of patients from the regions to the EDs inside the network and (3) percentage of patient arrivals with respect to the triage level. The experiments were sorted according to the first and third factors. Each PM was analyzed independently. On conclusion, a multi criteria analysis was conducted for each ED in order to show their preparedness capability for a major earthquake.

This allows computation previously possible only at endpoints to be carried out within the network itself, thus enabling optimizations and extensions of current protocols as well as the development of fundamentally new protocols [1]. Briefly, the main aim of active networks is to implement new communication architectures that allow for deployment of advanced networking services. In this paper, we describe the architectural framework for active networks and we review and compare the design of several experimental implementations of active networks that exist today, outlining the different approaches used in each of the design. In the process, the differences between two approaches to active networks i.e., a discrete approach and an integrated approach is illustrated. Finally, we provide examples of efforts to improve performance of applications using active networking.																			2643-2439	2643-2447	0-7803-7565-3				2002							371	374																WOS:000179447200093
J	Campbell, J; Corberán, A; Plana, I; Sanchis, JM; Segura, P				Campbell, James; Corberan, Angel; Plana, Isaac; Sanchis, Jose M.; Segura, Paula			Polyhedral analysis and a new algorithm for the length constrained <i>K</i>-drones rural postman problem	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS												The Length Constrained K-Drones Rural Postman Problem (LC K-DRPP) is a continuous optimization problem where a set of curved or straight lines of a network have to be traversed, in order to be serviced, by a fleet of homogeneous drones, with total minimum cost. Since the range and endurance of drones is limited, we consider here that the length of each route is constrained to a given limit L. Drones are not restricted to travel on the network, and they can enter and exit a line through any of its points, servicing only a portion of that line. Therefore, shorter solutions are obtained with "aerial" drones than with "ground" vehicles that are restricted to the network. If a LC K-DRPP instance is digitized by approximating each line with a polygonal chain, and it is assumed that drones can only enter and exit a line through the points of the chain, an instance of the Length Constrained K-vehicles Rural Postman Problem (LC K-RPP) is obtained. This is a discrete arc routing problem, and therefore can be solved with combinatorial optimization techniques. However, when the number of points in each polygonal chain is very large, the LC K-RPP instance can be so large that it is very difficult to solve, even for heuristic algorithms. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a procedure that generates smaller LC K-RPP instances by approximating each line by a few but "significant" points and segments. In this paper, we present a new formulation for the LC K-RPP with two binary variables for each edge and each drone representing the first and second traversals of the edge, respectively. We make a polyhedral study of the set of solutions of a relaxed formulation and prove that several families of inequalities induce facets of the polyhedron. We design and implement a branch-and-cut algorithm for the LC K-RPP that incorporates the separation of these inequalities. This B &C is the main routine of an iterative algorithm that, by solving a LC K-RPP instance at each step, finds good solutions for the original LC K-DRPP. The computational results show that the proposed method is effective in finding good solutions for LC K-DRPP, and that the branch-and-cut algorithm for the LC K-RPP outperforms the only published exact method for this problem.					; Plana, Isaac/H-6656-2015; SANCHIS, JOSE M/H-5912-2015	Segura Martinez, Paula/0000-0002-0395-9263; Plana, Isaac/0000-0002-0516-4608; SANCHIS, JOSE M/0000-0002-0039-8122													0926-6003	1573-2894				SEP	2022	83	1					67	109		10.1007/s10589-022-00383-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10589-022-00383-x		JUN 2022											WOS:000813999400001

In view of the fact that it is difficult for the estimator to completely obtain the mode information of the neural networks in the actual situations, the hidden Markov model is utilized to depict the mode mismatching phenomenon between the networks and estimator. Moreover, aimed at the circumstance that data are transmitted over fading channels, and an improved discrete-time Rice fading model with the mode-dependent channel coefficients is employed. The principal goal is to devise a state estimator which can ensure that the error system realizes the stochastic stability and satisfies the passive performance index.

J	Liu, YJ; Tong, SC				Liu, Yan-Jun; Tong, Shaocheng			Optimal Control-Based Adaptive NN Design for a Class of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Block-Triangular Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS												In this paper, we propose an optimal control scheme-based adaptive neural network design for a class of unknown nonlinear discrete-time systems. The controlled systems are in a block-triangular multi-input-multi-output pure-feedback structure, i.e., there are both state and input couplings and nonaffine functions to be included in every equation of each subsystem. The design objective is to provide a control scheme, which not only guarantees the stability of the systems, but also achieves optimal control performance. The main contribution of this paper is that it is for the first time to achieve the optimal performance for such a class of systems. Owing to the interactions among subsystems, making an optimal control signal is a difficult task. The design ideas are that: 1) the systems are transformed into an output predictor form; 2) for the output predictor, the ideal control signal and the strategic utility function can be approximated by using an action network and a critic network, respectively; and 3) an optimal control signal is constructed with the weight update rules to be designed based on a gradient descent method. The stability of the systems can be proved based on the difference Lyapunov method. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.					刘, 严君/GZL-5764-2022; Liu, Yan-Jun/H-6371-2011	Liu, Yan-Jun/0000-0002-1771-6342													2168-2267	2168-2275				NOV	2016	46	11					2670	2680		10.1109/TCYB.2015.2494007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2494007								26929080					WOS:000386227000024

Computational Models of Sprouting Angiogenesis and Cell Migration: Towards Multiscale Mechanochemical Models of Angiogenesis	MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF NATURAL PHENOMENA												Angiogenesis, the formation of new bloods vessels from the existing vasculature, is a process that is essential during development and regeneration of tissues, and that plays a major role in diseases like cancer. Computational models have been designed to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms behind angiogenesis. In this paper we review computational models of sprouting angiogenesis. These models can be subdivided into three categories: models that mainly focus on tip cell migration, models that make a distinction between the role of tip cells and stalk cells, and models that consider cell shape dynamics. Many models combine discrete modeling of individual cells with continuous modeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and diffusing solutes, in this way resulting in a hybrid model. We discuss their merits in unraveling the role of certain factors for vascular network formation, such as the role of (chemotactic, haptotactic, contact) guidance cues in the dynamics and morphology of vascular network formation, and the role of cell-cell interactions that govern tip cell selection and phenotypic changes in general. At the same time, we identify a need for the inclusion of cell mechanical principles in models of angiogenesis, in particular for the description of cell migration, cell-matrix and cell-cell interaction, as the generation of cellular forces is key to cell migration. To further underline this we review models of single cell migration that incorporate such principles, which could be the starting point for formulating novel models of angiogenesis that respect the fundamental laws of classical mechanics at the cell level. As the generation of cellular forces is strongly mediated by pro-angiogenic signals, such models must couple cell mechanical principles to molecular signaling into multiscale mechanochemical models of angiogenesis. Finally, a tight coupling between models and experiments will be required to facilitate model improvements and the generation of novel insights on the regulation of angiogenesis.

J	Othman, K				Othman, Kareem			Prediction of the hot asphalt mix properties using deep neural networks	BENI-SUEF UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCES												Background Marshall design process is the most common method used for estimating the Optimum asphalt content (OAC) and this process is called the asphalt mix design. However, this method is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and its results are subjected to variations. Results This paper employs artificial neural network (ANN) for the estimation of Marshall test parameters (OAC, Stability, Flow, Air voids, Voids in mineral aggregate) using the aggregate gradation as the input of the prediction process. Multiple ANNs are tested in order to optimize the NN hyperparameters and produce accurate predictions. Different activation functions, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons per hidden layer are tested and heatmaps are generated to compare the performance of every ANN. Results show that the optimum ANN hyperparameters change depending on the predicted parameter. Finally, the deep NN can predict the OAC, stability, flow, density, air voids, and voids in mineral aggregate with R values of 0.91, 0.8, 0.53, 0.65, 0.77, and 0.66. Conclusion The linear activation function is the most efficient activation function and generates more accurate results than the logistic and the hyperbolic tangent functions. Additionally, it is shown that the deep neural network approach represents a major innovative tool for the prediction of the asphalt mix properties as results of this approach outperforms results of the shallow ANN that consists of a single hidden layer which is the only approach used in the literature. Thus, the use of the deep ANN can be useful during the phase of the design of the asphalt mix process because of its ability to predict variables with high accuracy. For example, the ANN with 3 hidden layers and 16 neurons per layer with the linear activation function can predict the OAC with high accuracy (R = 0.91), which can be helpful in the design process as the ANN can be employed for the prediction of the OAC of the asphalt mix.

This paper presents an innovative network called the Dual-Direction Attention Mixed Feature Network (DDAMFN) specifically designed for FER, boasting both robustness and lightweight characteristics. The network architecture comprises two primary components: the Mixed Feature Network (MFN) serving as the backbone, and the Dual-Direction Attention Network (DDAN) functioning as the head. To enhance the network's capability in the MFN, resilient features are extracted by utilizing mixed-size kernels. Additionally, a new Dual-Direction Attention (DDA) head that generates attention maps in two orientations is proposed, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies effectively. To further improve the accuracy, a novel attention loss mechanism for the DDAN is introduced with different heads focusing on distinct areas of the input. Experimental evaluations on several widely used public datasets, including AffectNet, RAF-DB, and FERPlus, demonstrate the superiority of the DDAMFN compared to other existing models, which establishes that the DDAMFN as the state-of-the-art model in the field of FER.

One important method to learning Bayesian network from data is to employ a search procedure to explore the space of networks and a scoring metric to evaluate each candidate structure. In this paper, a novel discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm has been designed to solve the problem of Bayesian network structures learning. The proposed algorithm not only maintains the search advantages of the classical particle swarm optimization but also matches the characteristics of Bayesian networks. Meanwhile, mutation and neighbor searching operators have been used to overcome the drawback of premature convergence and balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of the particle swarm optimization.

Based on this discrete model with a step delay in control item, a new model of networked control systems is got by two steps transformation. The time delay in control item is disappeared in this new model. The existing conditions of asymptotic stability for networked control system are presented by Lyapunov method and robust control theory. The design method of stabilization controller for networked control system is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Comparing to the results in literature reported, the dimension of LMI used in this paper is the lowest. In the end the simulation based on the networked control unstable system is studied. The simulation results show the proposed controller is feasible and effective.																					978-7-5062-9220-7				2008							1170	1174																WOS:000262356100283

One of the most important goals of the reverse logistics network design is to minimize the costs or to maximize the profit. By the way, deciding on the number of collection centers, fabrics and distribution centers in a reverse logistics system are also very important. Uncertain factors can affect a reverse logistic network negatively. In this paper to cope with these uncertainties a fuzzy mixed integer linear programming model is developed for a reverse logistics network with a real case application on white goods sector refrigerator product group. In the proposed model customers' demand, return rate of products, unit transportation cost and repair cost are considered as uncertain parameters. The proposed model is solved by using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS)/CPLEX 9.0 optimization software ant it is executed for different return and repair rates to determine and compare the number of collection centers, fabrics, distribution centers and maximum profit. The obtained results are consistent with each other.					kaya, ihsan/AAG-5642-2019; Başlıgil, Hüseyin/AAJ-7902-2021; Özkan, Betül/AAB-7467-2022	kaya, ihsan/0000-0002-0142-4257; OZKIR, Vildan/0000-0002-2609-5234													1542-3980	1542-3999					2015	25	2-3					269	289																WOS:000364594400006

Recently, several binary and ternary networks, in which the costly multiply-accumulate operations can be replaced by accumulations or even binary logic operations, make the on-chip training of DNNs quite promising. Therefore there is a pressing need to build an architecture that could subsume these networks under a unified framework that achieves both higher performance and less overhead. To this end, two fundamental issues are yet to be addressed. The first one is how to implement the back propagation when neuronal activations are discrete. The second one is how to remove the full-precision hidden weights in the training phase to break the bottlenecks of memory/computation consumption. To address the first issue, we present a multi-step neuronal activation discretization method and a derivative approximation technique that enable the implementing the back propagation algorithm on discrete DNNs. While for the second issue, we propose a discrete state transition (DST) methodology to constrain the weights in a discrete space without saving the hidden weights. Through this way, we build a unified framework that subsumes the binary or ternary networks as its special cases, and under which a heuristic algorithm is provided at the website https://github.com/AcrossV/Gated-XNOR. More particularly, we find that when both the weights and activations become ternary values, the DNNs can be reduced to sparse binary networks, termed as gated XNOR networks (GXNOR-Nets) since only the event of non-zero weight and non-zero activation enables the control gate to start the XNOR logic operations in the original binary networks. This promises the event-driven hardware design for efficient mobile intelligence. We achieve advanced performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the computational sparsity and the number of states in the discrete space can be flexibly modified to make it suitable for various hardware platforms. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a new systematic design methodology has been developed for the simultaneous management of energy and water systems that also feature optimum regeneration of wastewater. In addition to allowing regeneration of wastewater, issues about heat losses inside unit operations have also been incorporated in the simultaneous management of water and energy. To implement such a design, two new design aspects are introduced; new method for "Non-isothermal Mixing" points identification and new "Separate System" generation. The first aspect involves "non-isothermal mixing", which enables direct heat recovery between water streams, and therefore allows the reduction of the number of heat transfer units. An NLP model is formulated to identify feasible non-isothermal mixing points in the network regarding minimum operation cost, which satisfy minimum freshwater and utility requirements. The other aspect is the generation of "separate system" in heat exchanger network design. The flexibility of mixing and splitting of water streams allows separate systems to be created as a cost-efficient series of heat exchanger units between freshwater and wastewater streams. The new design aspects have been illustrated with a case study. The results show 60% of total cost saving relevant to the conventional design method.						Panjeshahi, M.

The stochastic communication protocol is adopted to regulate the transmission order of the measurements from multiple sensor nodes, which could effectively avoid data collisions. Under the scheduling of communication protocol, only one sensor node is allowed to get access to the shared communication network at each time step for data transmission. Moreover, the stochastic communication protocol is governed by a Markov chain, which converts the protocol-constrained system into a Markovian jump system. It is the purpose to design a sliding mode observer such that, with the stochastic communication protocol, the trajectories of the estimation error system are driven into a band of the sliding surface and, in subsequent time, the sliding motion is mean-square asymptotically stable. By solving a minimization problem, the sufficient conditions for the desired sliding mode observer are established. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

J	Liu, CZ; Li, AH; Klemes, JJ; Liu, ZY				Liu, Chang-Zhan; Li, Ai-Hong; Klemes, Jiri Jaromir; Liu, Zhi-Yong			Design of distributed wastewater treatment networks by combining total mixing influence potential indicator with heuristic rules	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												This article presents a design method for the following wastewater treatment networks: a treatment process can remove multiple contaminants and/or a contaminant can be removed by multiple treatment processes. The method is developed by improving the numerical indicator of total mixing influence potential (TMIP), which was proposed by Li et al. (2015, AlChE J, 61: 3223-3231) based on the minimum treatment flowrate calculated with pinch-based method. The design procedure presented in this work includes two steps. First, calculate the values of TMIP with pinch method together with a linear programming approach for the processes which can remove multiple contaminants. Based on the TMIP values, the performing order of treatment processes can be identified and the initial network can be built. Secondly, for the situation when a contaminant needs to be removed by multiple processes, a heuristic rule and mass balance have been used to adjust the initial network for obtaining the final result. The proposed method has the advantages of noncomplicated calculation and engineering significance. It can provide the results close to those published in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, GM; Yu, JW; Li, SB				Wang, Guangmin; Yu, Junwei; Li, Shubin			AN MPCC FORMULATION AND ITS SMOOTH SOLUTION ALGORITHM FOR CONTINUOUS NETWORK DESIGN PROBLEM	PROMET-TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION												Continuous network design problem (CNDP) is searching for a transportation network configuration to minimize the sum of the total system travel time and the investment cost of link capacity expansions by considering that the travellers follow a traditional Wardrop user equilibrium (UE) to choose their routes. In this paper, the CNDP model can be formulated as mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (MPCC) by describing UE as a non-linear complementarity problem (NCP). To address the difficulty resulting from complementarity constraints in MPCC, they are substituted by the Fischer-Burmeister (FB) function, which can be smoothed by the introduction of the smoothing parameter. Therefore, the MPCC can be transformed into a well-behaved non-linear program (NLP) by replacing the complementarity constraints with a smooth equation. Consequently, the solver such as LINDOGLOBAL in GAMS can be used to solve the smooth approximate NLP to obtain the solution to MPCC for modelling CNDP. The numerical experiments on the example from the literature demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is feasible.

Development and preliminary validation of the Australia & New Zealand Musculoskeletal (ANZMUSC) Clinical Trials Network Research Question Importance Tool (ANZMUSC-RQIT)	PLOS ONE												Background and aimsHigh quality clinical research that addresses important questions requires significant resources. In resource-constrained environments, projects will therefore need to be prioritized. The Australia and New Zealand Musculoskeletal (ANZMUSC) Clinical Trials Network aimed to develop a stakeholder-based, transparent, easily implementable tool that provides a score for the 'importance' of a research question which could be used to rank research projects in order of importance. MethodsUsing a mixed-methods, multi-stage approach that included a Delphi survey, consensus workshop, inter-rater reliability testing, validity testing and calibration using a discrete-choice methodology, the Research Question Importance Tool (ANZMUSC-RQIT) was developed. The tool incorporated broad stakeholder opinion, including consumers, at each stage and is designed for scoring by committee consensus. ResultsThe ANZMUSC-RQIT tool consists of 5 dimensions (compared to 6 dimensions for an earlier version of RQIT): (1) extent of stakeholder consensus, (2) social burden of health condition, (3) patient burden of health condition, (4) anticipated effectiveness of proposed intervention, and (5) extent to which health equity is addressed by the research. Each dimension is assessed by defining ordered levels of a relevant attribute and by assigning a score to each level. The scores for the dimensions are then summed to obtain an overall ANZMUSC-RQIT score, which represents the importance of the research question. The result is a score on an interval scale with an arbitrary unit, ranging from 0 (minimal importance) to 1000. The ANZMUSC-RQIT dimensions can be reliably ordered by committee consensus (ICC 0.73-0.93) and the overall score is positively associated with citation count (standardised regression coefficient 0.33, p<0.001) and journal impact factor group (OR 6.78, 95% CI 3.17 to 14.50 for 3rd tertile compared to 1(st) tertile of ANZMUSC-RQIT scores) for 200 published musculoskeletal clinical trials. ConclusionWe propose that the ANZMUSC-RQIT is a useful tool for prioritising the importance of a research question.

J	Shaer, A; Talebian, A; Mishra, S				Shaer, Amin; Talebian, Ahmadreza; Mishra, Sabyasachee			Informing the Work Zone Safety Policy Analysis: Reconciling Multivariate Prediction and Artificial Neural Network Modeling	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS												Work zone safety, as an issue requiring complex solutions and tech-driven investment, has been a major concern for transportation agencies and policymakers. To help decision-makers prioritize investments, there is a need for tools enabling them to assess policies designed to reduce the cost and count of work zone crashes at the same time. Traditional statistical methods, however, are unable to consider two or more target variables when they are intrinsically different (e.g., when a mixture of continuous and dichotomous/discrete variables is of interest). As a result, the dependencies among the outputs of interest may be neglected, which potentially causes biased decision-making. In this study, we used two machine learning models, i.e., group method of data handling (GMDH) and multilayer perceptron (MLP), to simultaneously predict count and cost of work zone crashes in the state of Tennessee in the United States. We further used these tools to assess four policies that could help improve work zone safety. We compared predictability of these models in individual prediction of cost and count with the three statistical models of Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, and multivariate regression. Also, we compared the importance of different variables to evaluate the role that each input variable plays in prediction and recognized the most effective factors. Our results indicated that reduction of annual average daily traffic (AADT) and speed limit are the most effective policies to simultaneously lower work zone crash count and costs, ensued by reducing the percentage of trucks and prohibiting commercial vehicles on segments. We observed that MLP and GMDH perform almost equally in the simultaneous prediction, while these models provide significantly greater degrees of accuracy in crash count and cost prediction, compared with statistical models. The results depicted that the major predictors of cost and count prediction of work zone crashes are speed limit, illumination, involving commercial vehicles, AADT, type of road segment, and percentage of trucks.

Single-Layered Microfluidic Network-Based Combinatorial Dilution for Standard Simplex Lattice Design	MICROMACHINES												In this paper, we presented a straightforward strategy to generate 15 combinations of three samples based on an experimental simplex lattice design using a single-layer microfluidic network. First, we investigated the performances of the plain structural and the groove structural combinatorial devices by computational simulation (CFD-ACE+). The simulated output concentrations were extremely close to the desirable values within an absolute error of less than 1%. Based on the simulated designs, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices were fabricated with soft lithography and tested with fluorescent dye (sodium salt). The mixing results for 15 combinations showed good performance, with an absolute error of less than 4%. We also investigated two liquid handling methods (bottom-up and top-down) for high-throughput screening and assay. The liquid-handling methods were successfully accomplished by adding the systematic structured groove sets on the mixing channels.

At lower level the alternatives are evaluated based on the route and mode user decisions. The optimization objectives are to maximize the transit demand and minimize the private travel time, considering the user's behavior, the physical network, budget constraints and the network design constraints. The design criteria are considered as location constraints, they have been traditionally defined by node and link compatibilities defining lines, but we define a new location constraints based in to minimize the number of routing intersections. The demand mode splitting constraints may be defined by all or nothing mode assignment or like it is proposed by us in this paper by Logit distribution. The models defined with the above alternatives are large integer multicommodity flow network design problems with side constraints. These sets of alternatives are computationally studied to obtain conclusions.

The NN weights are tuned online by using a novel update law. By using Lyapunov techniques, all signals can be shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). In addition, the interaction of the converter with the GTI is investigated to assure stability of the entire interconnected system while the GTI is controlled via a novel stabilizer similar to power system stabilizer (PSS).

To fulfill the growing demand for high-speed data communication and for enabling the Internet of Things (IoT), a network with high data rates and bandwidth is required. The research is focused on the work to standardize the solutions for network challenges being faced due to high radio frequencies and to enable the highly advanced attributes. The significant amount of research in the Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC) is being conducted as the size of an IC is being smaller and its power consumption is very low compared to a discrete circuit. The present study is focused on converting the discrete wireless transceiver circuit into a System on Chip (SOC), where all different components are integrated on to a single chip. The Power amplifier (PA) is a significant part of the wireless transceiver system and consumes a lot of power. Hence the power amplifier becomes an almost integral part of the wireless communication system to study and improve its overall efficiency. In this paper, we present an account of challenges and efficient architectures used for RFIC design suitable for 5G networks.

Due to the improvement of network openness, external cyberattacks are more likely to tamper with the neighbor information transmitted in the cooperative control system. In this study, a discrete-time resilient-distributed secondary control strategy is designed to resist potential unbounded false data injection (FDI) attacks, which introduces a virtual network layer interconnecting the control network layer to form a layered network. The strategy can maintain the stability of voltage and frequency under unbounded attacks and then greatly suppress the state estimation difference of voltage and frequency. Meanwhile, the unbounded attack depending on voltage and frequency estimation difference is suppressed to a nearly bounded attack. Finally, a microgrid consisting of six inverter-based DGs is taken as an example to validate the effectiveness of the strategy against unbounded attacks.																			2296-598X					AUG 16	2022	10								961488	10.3389/fenrg.2022.961488	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2022.961488													WOS:000848349000001
J	Pedroso, L; Batista, P; Oliveira, P; Silvestre, C				Pedroso, Leonardo; Batista, Pedro; Oliveira, Paulo; Silvestre, Carlos			Discrete-time distributed Kalman filter design for networks of interconnected systems with linear time-varying dynamics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE												This paper addresses the problem of designing distributed state estimation solutions for a network of interconnected systems modelled by linear time-varying (LTV) dynamics in a discrete-time framework. The problem is formulated as a classical optimal estimation problem, for the global system, subject to a given sparsity constraint on the filter gain, which reflects the distributed nature of the network. Two methods are presented, both of them able to compute a sequence of well-performing stabilising gains. Moreover, both methods are validated by resorting to simulations of: (i) a randomly generated synthetic LTV system; and (ii) a large-scale nonlinear network of interconnected tanks. One of the proposed methods relies on a computationally efficient solution, thus it is computed very rapidly. The other achieves better performance, but it is computationally more expensive and requires that a window of the future dynamics of the system is known.

In view of optical networks, by adopting a mixed line rate (MLR) strategy, wavelength division multiplexed networks can cost-effectively respond to diverse variety of traffic requirements which have heterogeneous service demands. From existing studies on MLR networks, it can be inferred that depending upon channel configuration, modulation format and link length, a spectral-efficient network can outperform a power-efficient network. In the current work, we compare the performance of a MLR network which is spectral-efficient and power-efficient. We conduct extensive simulations considering realistic parameters and physical layer impairments. To the network designers, our study advocates a MLR network which is spectrally efficient since; our results demonstrate that, in addition to achieving close packing of the channels, a spectrally-efficient MLR network is also able to achieve close performances to that shown by power-efficient MLR network.

While there are techniques available for discrete event simulation of production lines, the opportunities of applying such techniques on higher manufacturing network levels are not explored to the same extent. With established methods for optimisation of manufacturing lines showing proven potential in conceptual analysis and development of production lines, the application of such optimisation methods on higher level manufacturing networks is a subject for further exploration. In this paper, an extended aggregation technique for discrete event simulation of higher level manufacturing systems is discussed, proposed, tested, and verified with real-world problem statements as a proof of concept. The contribution of the new technique is to enable the application of DES models, with reasonable computational requirements, at higher level manufacturing networks. The proposed technique can be used to generate valuable decision information supporting conceptual systems development.

We studied the influence of geometric parameters and pressure drop on mixing efficiency and analyzed the concentration curves of fluid at the outlet. The influence of geometric parameters on mixing performance is studied by using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a. The number of hierarchical levels can have a significant effect on mixing efficiency and the more of the levels, the higher of the mixing efficiency. For Y-type micromixer, the influence of different branch angles alpha = 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees on the mixing efficiency was analyzed, and the 30 degrees Y-type micromixer has the best mixing performance. The micromixer designed in this paper has a high mixing efficiency of over 90% in the range of Re 0.5-100. The generalized Murray's law can be widely used in the design of micromixers.

The method comprises six steps, including the generation of different technology options, energy balance modeling of the demand and supply, and multiobjective evaluation and optimization. As a decision-support tool, ternary diagrams are applied to analyze the effect of the mix of energy consumers in an EneCoN (i.e., residents, offices, or hospitals) on the objective function. The overall outcome of applying the method is a suggestion for the technology mix in the EneCoN that minimizes design objectives such as cost and environmental impacts with consideration of the mix of energy consumers as a design parameter. A case study was conducted on the installation of photovoltaic power generators, solar heat collectors, and fuel cells as new energy technologies in the target cities Tokyo, Sapporo, and Naha. Differences in the climate and energy demand profile were well reflected in the calculation, and different suggestions for the technology mix were obtained. The method also allowed good visualization of various complex design options (e.g., consumers, technology types, and the degree of combination) and can serve as a solid basis for designing energy systems.

But traditional deep learning networks simply increase the depth and breadth of the network. This leads to a higher complexity of the model. We propose Adaptively Weighted Channel Feature Network of Mixed Convolution Kernel(SKENet). SKENet extract features from different kernels, then mixed those features by element-wise, lastly do sigmoid operator on channel features to get adaptive weightings. We did a simple classification test on the CIFAR10 amd CIFAR100 dataset. The results show that SKENet can achieve a better result in a shorter time. After that, we did an object detection experiment on the VOC dataset. The experimental results show that SKENet is far ahead of the SKNet [20] in terms of speed and accuracy.																					978-1-7281-6092-4				2019							87	91		10.1109/CIS.2019.00027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2019.00027													WOS:000557886100019

Compared to the conventional protocol, the designed protocol of this study significantly decreases the communication frequency and improves the communication efficiency. Besides, the system stability is analyzed by problem transformation, formation control is converted into consensus control, and it is proved that the expected formation can be arrived under the designed protocol.

A discrete-time nonlinear SPCN model is first devised on two time scales with their discrepancies reflected by a singular perturbation parameter (SPP). The network measurement outputs are transmitted via a communication network where the data transmissions are scheduled by the RR protocol with hope to avoid the undesired data collision. The error dynamics of the state estimation is governed by a switched system with a periodic switching parameter. A novel Lyapunov function is constructed that is dependent on both the transmission order and the SPP. By establishing a key lemma specifically tackling the SPP, sufficient conditions are obtained such that, for any SPP less than or equal to a predefined upper bound, the error dynamics of the state estimation is asymptotically stable and satisfies a prescribed H-infinity performance requirement. Furthermore, the explicit parameterization of the desired state estimator is given by means of the solution to a set of matrix inequalities, and the upper bound of the SPP is then evaluated in the feasibility of these matrix inequalities. Moreover, the corresponding results for linear discrete-time SPCNs are derived as corollaries. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed state estimator design scheme.

Most of the work on network coding focuses on the obtained throughput gain. They show that mixing lineally the packets at the intermediate nodes is capacity-achieving. However, network coding schemes designed only to maximize the throughput could be unfairly biased. The reason is that by mixing different flows, packets destined to one destination in order to be decoded need to wait for the reception of the whole mixed set of encoded packets that may be totally independent in terms of final destination. This may lead to highly unfair delay for small block data. To mitigate this unfairness, relay nodes may mix only packets going to the same destination. We call this strategy FairMix. Although FairMix may limit the maximum attainable throughput, it aims to make distinct for decoding delay of each destination corresponding to the size of the data block. In order to investigate this trade off, we compare the FairMix performance with a naive network coding which mixes packets destined to different destinations. The simulation under lossy wireless links, limited memory and bandwidth resources, and different block sizes shows that FairMix is effective in improving fairness among destinations in comparison to naive network coding.																					978-1-4244-5123-4				2009							420	424		10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450123													WOS:000305824600085

To fill this gap, this study proposes a new discrete opinion dynamics model based on the sentiment- opinion transformation mechanism.

In addition, the model is initialized based on an initial -sentiment matrix of the information instead of a certain mathematical distribution. Subsequently, we design the simulation experiments using different values of parameters and different network topologies to study four effects on sentiment and opinion dynamics, namely, the effects of the threshold, the effects of the initial-sentiment matrix, the effects of the sentiment-opinion matrix, and the effects of the second piece of information.

In this way, we can encode all of the sensing devices in the network making sure that each sensor is completely distinguishable from each other even under overlapping conditions. Since these devices are complex structures involving unique magnitude and phase response, the demodulation method should be able to recover the associated magnitude and phase response in order to identify each device in the sensing network. To do so, we use a single side band modulated optical source sweeping over the operational wavelength range of the sensors, the reflected signal from the sensors is sent to a vector network analyzer in which it is obtained the magnitude and phase ratio of the network in the microwave domain. Experimental demonstration has been carried out including the manufacturing of DPSS structures. Feasibility of the interrogation technique for devices involving magnitude and phase distinction has been validated, not only to identify encoded sensors in a measurement network but also to allow overlapping between them, which allow to increase the number of sensors allocated in the sensing network.					; Daniel, Pastor/G-3724-2012	Triana Infante, Cristian Andres/0000-0002-6398-0582; Daniel, Pastor/0000-0002-5297-3918; Varon Duran, Margarita/0000-0003-2498-8204													0733-8724	1558-2213				JUL 15	2017	35	14					2880	2886		10.1109/JLT.2017.2705283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2705283													WOS:000402881900015

Taking Account of Uncertainty in Demand Growth When Phasing the Construction of a Water Distribution Network	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												As is well known, water systems grow gradually over long periods of time, and the life of piping tends to be much longer than the planning horizon used for pipe sizing. Furthermore, the uncertainty about future demands grows with the length of the time horizon. The design of water-distribution systems should therefore be performed in phases, to follow the gradual network growth, and taking account of the uncertainty connected with demand growth. The design approach proposed in this paper to consider these aspects is able to identify, on prefixed time steps or intervals, the necessary upgrades of the construction where each upgrade consists of installing pipes in new sites or in parallel to pipes that already exist, in order to render the network able to satisfy user demand with acceptable service pressure over the different phases of its life. Uncertainty in demand growth is considered by expressing the growth rate by means of a discrete random variable with assigned probability mass function. Optimization of phasing of construction is then performed by considering two objective functions: present-worth cost of the construction (to be minimized), and minimum-pressure surplus over time (to be maximized), which is represented as a discrete random variable with a derived probability distribution as a consequence of the assumption made on the water demand, which randomly grows from phase to phase of the construction. Within this framework, a specific criterion to rank discrete random variables is presented here. The application of the methodology to a case study shows that optimizing phasing of construction while accounting for uncertainty in demand growth leads to the network being sized more conservatively, so that the network construction obtained turns out to be more flexible to adapt itself to various conditions of demand growth over time.

First, with the case of sufficient network resources, an adaptive neural controller is designed with a new neural weight update law, which avoids the n$$ n $$-step delay of traditional adaptive neural control methods. The proposed controller performs the tracking control task while ensuring that the radial basis function neural network can accurately identify the unknown system nonlinear dynamics and the estimated neural weights can converge to their ideal values. Second, with the case of limited network resources, the convergent neural weights can be reused to construct the neural network model, event-trigger conditions, and the neural learning controller, which can improve the tracking control performance and save the communication resources. Especially, compared with the traditional event-triggered adaptive neural controller, the neural learning controller can reduce the burden of online calculations since the constant neural weights are used to construct the neural network model and trigger conditions. For the proposed control scheme, simulation results are given to verify its effectiveness.					shi, haotian/ABY-3582-2022	shi, haotian/0000-0001-5010-1000													1049-8923	1099-1239				SEP 10	2022	32	13					7611	7630		10.1002/rnc.6228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rnc.6228		JUN 2022											WOS:000806854300001

Various combinations of search algorithms and surrogate models were tested to find the best optimization methods. Aerodynamic analysis was performed using three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical results obtained for the total pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency were validated with experimental data for the centrifugal compressor with a smooth casing. The yaw and pitch angles of the guide vanes and axial distance between cavities were selected as design variables. The stall margin was used as an objective function for the design optimization. Latin hypercube sampling was used to select 27 sample points in the design space. The best combination was found by testing four surrogate models (response surface approximation, Kriging, radial basis neural network, and deep neural network models) and three searching algorithms (a genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and hybrid PSO-GA). Hybrid PSO-GA with the DNN model showed the best overall results.

A METHOD OF SUPERIMPOSED TRIANGULATIONS FOR CALCULATION OF VELOCITY GRADIENT OF HORIZONTAL MOVEMENTS: APPLICATION TO THE CENTRAL ASIAN GPS NETWORK	GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS												A new method is proposed to define piecewise continuous fields of velocity gradients of recent horizontal movements of the Earth's crust from spatially discrete data on horizontal velocities of such movements. The method is designed to identify spatial inhomogeneities in the field of horizontal strain rates (e.g., zones of localized deformation and boundaries between areas with different strain rates) in considerable detail. It is applied to determine the field of horizontal velocity gradient in the region of the Central Asian GPS network which covers vast territories of the Kyrgyz Tien-Shan and Pamirs mountain ranges, the T arim depression, and the Kazakh Shield (Fig. 1). Calculations are based on GPS survey data obtained at 308 sites from 1995 to 2006 (Fig. 4). The resolution of the proposed method is increased by using a triangulation grid which is much denser than a conventional one (Fig. 2 and 3). As a result, point x on the surface under study is covered by several triangles rather than one (Fig. 5). Strain characteristics at point x are calculated by weighted summation of corresponding characteristics in the cover triangles. Thus, for each point we estimate spin tensor W, which defines angular velocity omega, and components of horizontal strain rate tensor E. These components provide for direct calculation of orientation of principal axes and invariants of E, i.e. maximum stretching E-1, maximum shortening E-2, velocity divergence E=E-1+E-2, and maximum shear rates Gamma=vertical bar E-1-E-2 vertical bar/2 (Fig. 6 to 11). The calculated values are presented in maps which demonstrate that spatial distribution of such values is highly inhomogeneous. Regions with increased values of kinematic characteristics mentioned above stand out sharply against the background. At the same time, spatial distribution of the kinematical characteristics in the Tien Shan region is quite regular: zones of increased absolute values of E-2 are mainly oriented in the ENE direction, while the NNW orientation dominates in zones of increased values of E-1.

However, there are two main problems in the previous works. One is to use the typical three-dimensional convolution analysis, resulting in more parameters of the network. The other is not to pay more attention to the mining of hyperspectral image spatial information, when the spectral information can be extracted. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a mixed convolutional network (MCNet) for hyperspectral image super-resolution. We design a novel mixed convolutional module (MCM) to extract the potential features by 2D/3D convolution instead of one convolution, which enables the network to more mine spatial features of hyperspectral image. To explore the effective features from 2D unit, we design the local feature fusion to adaptively analyze from all the hierarchical features in 2D units. In 3D unit, we employ spatial and spectral separable 3D convolution to extract spatial and spectral information, which reduces unaffordable memory usage and training time. Extensive evaluations and comparisons on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods.

J	Subulan, K; Baykasoglu, A				Subulan, Kemal; Baykasoglu, Adil			A case-oriented computational study for sustainable fleet planning in a battery closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty	ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS												Purpose - The purpose of this study is to develop a holistic optimization model for an integrated sustainable fleet planning and closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design problem under uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach - A novel mixed-integer programming model that is able to consider interactions between vehicle fleet planning and CLSC network design problems is first developed. Uncertainties of the product demand and return fractions of the end-of-life products are handled by a chance-constrained stochastic program. Several Pareto optimal solutions are generated for the conflicting sustainability objectives via compromise and fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approaches. Findings - The proposed model is tested on a real-life lead/acid battery recovery system. By using the proposed model, sustainable fleet plans that provide a smaller fleet size, fewer empty vehicle repositions, minimal CO2 emissions, maximal vehicle safety ratings and minimal injury/illness incidence rate of transport accidents are generated. Furthermore, an environmentally and socially conscious CLSC network with maximal job creation in the less developed regions, minimal lost days resulting from the work's damages during manufacturing/recycling operations and maximal collection/recovery of end-of-life products is also designed. Originality/value - Unlike the classical network design models, vehicle fleet planning decisions such as fleet sizing/composition, fleet assignment, vehicle inventory control, empty repositioning, etc. are also considered while designing a sustainable CLSC network. In addition to sustainability indicators in the network design, sustainability factors in fleet management are also handled. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no similar paper in the literature that proposes such a holistic optimization model for integrated sustainable fleet planning and CLSC network design.

Sensor nodes under consideration are distributed in space according to a fixed network topology, and each sensor receives the information from both the system and its neighbors. The missing measurement phenomenon on each sensor occurs in a random way and is governed by a series of mutually independent random variables obeying a certain Bernoulli distribution. To deal with the sparsity issue of estimator gain matrix, a set of measurement models is established for each sensor to describe all available information from the node itself and its neighbors. Our attention is focused on the design of a recursive estimator for every sensor node to simultaneously estimate unknown input and state in the sense of unbiased minimum-variance. Using direct algebraic operation, we obtain the estimator parameter matrices recursively, and the design algorithm is also provided. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme.																			2161-2927		978-9-8815-6391-0				2016							5038	5043																WOS:000400282201086

To save the communication resources between the sensor and the controller, the so-called dynamic event-triggered mechanism is adopted to schedule the measurement signal. A neural network-based observer is first designed to provide both the system states and fault information. Then, with consideration of the actuator saturation phenomenon, the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is designed based on the estimates provided by the observer. To reduce the computational burden, the optimal control strategy is implemented via the single network adaptive critic architecture. The sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the boundedness of the overall closed-loop systems. Finally, the numerical simulations on a two-link flexible manipulator system are provided to verify the validity of the proposed control strategy.

This paper considers how to reconstruct the network topology according to the continuous-time data on the network. Inspired by the generative adversarial network(GAN), we design a deep learning framework based on network continuous-time data. The framework predicts the edge connection probability between network nodes by learning the correlation between network node state vectors. To verify the accuracy and adaptability of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on scale-free networks and small-world networks at different network scales using three different dynamics: heat diffusion dynamics, mutualistic interaction dynamics, and gene regulation dynamics. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the other five traditional correlation indices, which demonstrates that our method can reconstruct the topology of different scale networks well under different network dynamics.																			2199-4536	2198-6053				JUN	2023	9	3					3131	3146		10.1007/s40747-022-00893-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40747-022-00893-5		NOV 2022											WOS:000887880900003

Online Model-Free Reinforcement Learning for Output Feedback Tracking Control of a Class of Discrete-Time Systems With Input Saturation	IEEE ACCESS												In this paper, a new model-free Model-Actor (MA) reinforcement learning controller is developed for output feedback control of a class of discrete-time systems with input saturation constraints. The proposed controller is composed of two neural networks, namely a model-network and an actor network. The model-network is utilized to predict the output of the plant when a certain control action is applied to it. The actor network is utilized to estimate the optimal control action that is required to drive the output to the desired trajectory. The main advantages of the proposed controller over the previously proposed controllers are its ability to control systems in the absence of explicit knowledge of these systems' dynamics and its ability to start learning from scratch without any offline training. Also, it can explicitly handle the control constraints in the controller design. Comparison results with a previously published reinforcement learning output feedback controller and other controllers confirm the superiority of the proposed controller.

There were one network module and four kernel modules (sensor, controller, actuator and interference nodes) on this simulation platform, and the composition and the main Matlab codes of each module were presented. On the simulation platform designed, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm was achieved to derive the parameters of the DTHMM and the Viterbi algorithm was achieved to predict the controller-to-actuator delay (C-A delay) in the current sampling period. Based on the derived DTHMM and the predicted delays, a state-feedback controller to stabilize the NCS was also implemented on the simulation platform and used to solve the linear matrix inequalities. Taking a damped compound pendulum as the plant in the NCS, after 500 sampling periods the effectiveness of the modeling and controlling methods was carried out, and demonstrated the efficiency and easy operation of the simulation platform.																					978-1-4244-6712-9				2010							4400	4406		10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554054													WOS:000295959504160

The system under consideration is transformed into a stochastic one with bounded stochastic delay. Considering that the stochastic delay is characterized by nonuniform distribution, a new equivalent model is then constructed that enables the DSNS's controller design to benefit from knowing the probability characteristic of packet losses. Specially, to verify this feature, the probabilities of the delay can be explicitly obtained by utilizing the formula of total probability, which is critical to model transformation and analyze practical problems that exist in DSNSs. Based on the proposed model, sufficient conditions are established under which the globally mean-square asymptotic stability of resulting stochastic delay closed-loop system is guaranteed, and a delay-distribution-dependent design procedure is then proposed. A numerical example with simulation is provided to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the design procedure.

To deal with the tremendous increase in traffic, optical network with multiple lines with different data rates, mixed line rate or multi line rate (MLR) and elastic optical network can be considered as a better option. The advanced optical communication technologies such as mixed line rate along with elastic optical network can cope with the high data rates up to 1Tb/s. Mixed Line Rate or multi line rate network uses multiple modulation formats and different data rates, elasticity in the network also add many benefits like low cost, better capacity of network and handles increased data rates. By exploiting mixed line rate networks (MLRs) and different modulation formats, cost effective optical networks can be designed. Advanced modulation formats like QPSK, 16 QAM, OOK can be used to make the bit rate higher and the system spectral efficient. The next generation optical networks are considered to be heterogeneous in nature as they use different modulation formats with different data rates so that they can cope with the demand of versatile data rate of the users.																					978-93-80544-34-2				2019							577	580																WOS:000548605000115

The focus of this research is to solve network design problem occurring in packaged gases (e.g., cylinder) supply chain. The integrated logistics network design problem for packaged gases is defined as follows: given a set of potential locations for filling plants and hubs, and customers with deterministic demands, determine the configuration of the production-distribution system i.e., optimal facility locations, the filling plant production capacities, the inventory at plants and hubs, and the number of packages to be routed in primary and secondary transportation. The problem is modeled as a deterministic mixed integer program and a decomposition approach is developed which allows a natural split of the production and distribution decisions. The proposed framework is illustrated with numerical examples from real-life packaged gases supply chain. The results show that the decomposition approach is effective in solving a broad range of problem sizes. The results from the decomposition approach are benchmarked by solving optimally the whole packaged gases network design model for smaller test cases.

The L-BFGS algorithm is utilized for updating the Hessian matrix in each quantization iteration. Moreover, we specifically design the loss function for objection detection networks by jointly considering the quantization effects on classification and regression loss. Experimental results on RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN show that the proposed DHMQ achieves state-of-the-art performance for quantized object detectors.

This article proposes a multiscale convergence coordinated pyramid network (MCCPN) with mixed attention and Fast-robust NMS (MMFNet) for the fast detection of forest fire smoke. First, an MCCPN is designed, which combines a dual-attention feature pyramid network and a coordinated convergence module. It improves the detection rate of targets of different sizes. Second, a mixed attention module is designed to focus more on the smoke in the image and enhance the extraction of horizontal and vertical features of smoke. Then, a Fast-robust nonmaximum suppression is proposed to accelerate the convergence of bounding boxes and increase the accuracy of the prediction box. Finally, a forest fire detection system of the Internet of Things using MMFNet is built. The experimental results show that our method achieves 80.72% AP, 88.52% AP(50), 83.45% AP(75), 46.88% AR, and 154 FPS, which is superior to the state-of-art forest fire smoke detection methods.

The Markov jump NNs are introduced to be close to reality, where the modes of the NNs and guaranteed cost controller are determined by two mutually independent Markov chains. The asynchronous phenomenon is considered, which increases the difficulty of designing required mode-dependent controller. The event-triggered mechanism is designed by comparing the relative measurement error with the last triggered state at the process of data transmission, which is used to eliminate dispensable transmission and reduce the networked energy consumption. In addition, the signal fading is considered for the effect of signal reflection and shadow in wireless networks, which is modeled by the novel Rice fading models. Some novel sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee that the closed-loop system reaches a specified cost value under the designed jumping state feedback control law in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, some simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) has been traditionally applied to computers and embedded systems in isolation without considering them as a global inter-connected system. The paper contributes to fill this gap by proposing 1) a communication-aware design flow for network-interconnected embedded systems and 2) a formal framework to efficiently synthesize their network aspects by formulating and solving an optimization problem.

There is a high risk of cracking for the thick structure in manufacture process especially for the curved one. In this paper, double-layer artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs), mixed feeding network and built-in wide-band laminated waveguide (LWG) with rectangular waveguide (RWG) transition are specially analyzed and designed. These structures all have low-profile characteristics. Thus, they are suitable for conformal LTCC process. The double-layer AMCs are presented to enhance the bandwidth and the gain of a Ka-band patch element. The thin mixed network consisting of microstrip line (MSL) and LWG is used to replace the thick multistage LWG network. An improved LWG-RWG transition integrated in LWG layer is designed to possess wider bandwidth. At last, the low-profile conformal 16x16 antenna array is designed, manufactured and tested. The measured results demonstrate that the low-profile conformal 16x16 antenna array has a good and stable performance with an enhanced impendence bandwidth of 12.17% and a high gain up to 26.9dB.

Although this controller has been established as a control standard, tuning of its parameters and finding their optimal combination still represents a challenge, particularly under changing operating conditions, where control designer cannot rely on the invariance of the plant model. Tuning of the proportional, integral and derivative gain of a PID controller represents an optimization task, for which we propose in this work a solution based on artificial intelligence (AI) approach using radial basis (RB) function for activation of neural networks (NN) which adapt the controller gains and learn the plant model in order to account for the controller influence on the control outcome. The controller is implemented in a discrete-time system which enables real-time learning and implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is tested on a benchmark example of a discrete-time model of a cantilever beam, obtained through the subspace model identification.

One challenging problem is that it is still unclear how to construct the regulator equations of stochastic MASs with unknown dynamics for dynamic exosystem compensation. Toward this end, this article develops a novel distributed control scheme for the approximate output regulation of discrete-time stochastic MASs subject to heterogeneous and unknown nonlinear dynamics. A distributed observer is designed for the exosystem-state estimation of agents, based upon which nonlinear regulator equations are constructed for the feedforward control design, thereby achieving distributed exosystem compensation. A high-order neural network is deployed to approximately solve the nonlinear regulator equations with unknown nonlinearity, and an adaptive control law is developed for the approximate output regulation of discrete-time stochastic MASs. Stability analysis shows that the closed-loop system is semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control law.

It may pull down the voltage of the power supply network; it will severely influence the other electrical devices in the same power network. Furthermore, it increases the motor temperature, which may lead to motor damage. Therefore, a novel integrated method of motor discrete variable frequency starting and harmonic filtering is presented in this paper, to achieve quick and smooth motor starting, to produce high staring torque, to keep the harmonics in permitted ranges. The following works have been done in the study: analyze the principle, design the structure of the integrated device, and present the implementation steps. The motor starter developed with this method has been successfully applied to the loads of the drive equipments in the kiln, coal grinding mill or the mine.

However, time-varying delays of communication networks would be induced due to increasing information exchange requirement that caused by the increasing number of devices connecting to the communication networks as well as bandwidth limitation of marine network. Meanwhile, the propeller load is difficult to model due to the complexity of ship dynamics, which increases the uncertainty of marine electric propulsion system. Thus, robust control of the marine electric propulsion system is necessary and challenging. This paper presents a mixed H-infinity/ILQR robust controller design for marine electric propulsion system to address robust speed tracking problem under possible network-induced delays. The propeller dynamic model is built via open-water experimental data to reflect propeller load characteristics. Then, a delay-free model is established for the marine electric propulsion system by using system augmentation technique, with the random network-induced delay characterized by polytopic inclusions and Taylor series expansion. A mixed H-infinity/ILQR robust controller design is proposed for the marine electric propulsion system. Finally, based on a detailed controller area network model, the performance and effectiveness of the mixed H-infinity/ILQR robust controller are demonstrated by comparative simulation tests of a marine electric propulsion system with 4.088 MW permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM).

Formation of attractor dynamics in recurrent neural network is first carried out by training the clean speech subspace as the continuous attractor.

The structure and training of this recurrent connection, is designed in such a way that the network learns to denoise the signal step by step, using properties of attractors it has formed, along with phone recognition. Using these connections, the recognition accuracy is improved 21% for the stationary signal and 14% for the nonstationary one with 0db SNR, in respect to a reference model which is a feedforward neural network.

Metro aggregation networks provide transport between access gateway nodes and such servers accommodating virtual network functions (VNFs). Networks need to be designed to increase the efficiency of network resource usage and reducing network cost as well as energy consumption. However, independently placing VNFs on a server from a physical network design degrades the efficiency of resource usage and causes an increase in network cost. We can avoid such problems by adequately placing each VNF in consideration of the location of access gateway nodes and a network topology. We thus propose a method for designing an optical aggregation network with VNF placement. We successfully formulate the design method as mixed-integer linear programming and demonstrate its effectiveness through intensive mathematical experiments. The experiments showed that the proposed method reduced network cost by up to about 18% while performing almost optimally in terms of server load dispersion.

In earlier days, survivability schemes were implemented with the assumption that the physical layer conditions are ideal in nature. It is seen that in long haul WDM transmissions, four wave mixing (FWM) affects the quality of transmission in fiber. Therefore it is necessary to develop new techniques that will establish error free connections. In this paper, we have proposed an end-to end path protection algorithm that includes the impact of four wave mixing on the routing and wavelength assignment in WDM optical networks. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is much better when compared to the existing popular schemes proposed earlier for WDM optical networks with and without considering the physical layer impairment.

The uncertain parameters are supposed to belong to a given convex bounded polyhedral domain. A methodology is developed to design a stable linear filter that assures asymptotic stability and a prescribed H-infinity performance for the filtering error, irrespective of the uncertainty and the time delays. The proposed design is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which has the advantage in that it can be implemented numerically very efficiently.

J	Hemadeh, IA; El-Hajjar, M; Hanzo, L				Hemadeh, Ibrahim A.; El-Hajjar, Mohammed; Hanzo, Lajos			Hierarchical Multi-Functional Layered Spatial Modulation	IEEE ACCESS												In pursuit of optimal index modulation -aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where information is implicitly conveyed by relying on the on/off mechanism of the system's components in addition to the classical amplitude, phase, or frequency components, we present in a tutorial style our novel multi-functional (MF) architecture of layered multi-set (LMS) modulation. This generalized framework subsumes various MIMO techniques exhibiting different multiplexing and diversity functionalities. Our LMS design relies on three constituents, namely the space-time (ST) unit, the layered unit and the spatial switching unit. More specifically, the ST unit relies on the generalized space-time shift keying (GSTSK) scheme, where P - rather than one - out of Q ST dispersion matrices are selected for dispersing an equivalent number of phase-shift keying/quadrature amplitude modulation symbols across the antennas and time-slots. In the layered unit, multiple GSTSK codewords are stacked within the layers of codewords spread over time and space. The spatial switching unit activates N-c(t) out of N-t transmit antennas. Owing to its hierarchical MF architecture, our LMS system strikes a flexible design trade-off between the achievable throughput as well as the attainable diversity gain and it can potentially subsume various conventional MIMO schemes, such as Bell Lab's Layered Space-Time, space-time block codes, layered steered space-time codes, spatial modulation (SM), space-shift keying, linear dispersion codes, generalized SM, STSK, GSTSK, quadrature SM and multi-set STSK. Additionally, we derive the LMS system's discrete-input continuous-output memoryless channel capacity, which encompasses the capacity limit of all the LMS subsidiaries. We also propose a two-stage serially concatenated soft-decision (SD) based LMS detector by relying on an inner and an outer decoder that iteratively exchange their extrinsic information in order to achieve a near-capacity performance. Last but not least, we utilize the extrinsic information transfer charts for analyzing the convergence behavior of our SD-aided coded LMS scheme.

The influence of the mixing performance of the micromixer was studied by changing the geometry sizes of obstacles, the branch angles and the distances between obstacles. The mixing performance of micromixer was analyzed from three aspects, including mixing efficiency, flow behavior, and pressure drop. We designed three different obstacles A, B, and C, the micromixer with obstacle C has the highest mixing efficiency. For the distances of obstacles, the micromixer with smaller distance has the higher mixing efficiency. The micromixer with branch angle of 75 degrees has the highest mixing efficiency in the range of Reynolds number (Re) 0.1 to 150.

This paper introduces a framework which deals with the design of a transportation strategy for pharmaceutical supply chains. It consists of three steps: (i) identifying the configuration of the current distribution network, (ii) designing an optimal distribution network while determining the appropriate location-allocation decisions, and (iii) choosing the most appropriate transportation network strategy through the application of a multi-criteria decision analysis method (MCDA). The proposed framework is illustrated in designing a transportation network strategy for the Moroccan pharmaceutical products supply chain.																					978-1-4673-8571-8				2016																								WOS:000392439200022

When natural disasters (e. g. Hurricane Sandy) occur, the ability of these networks to provide service is often degraded because of physical damage to network components. One of the most critical of these networks is the electrical distribution grid, with medium voltage circuits often suffering the most severe damage. However, well-placed upgrades to these distribution grids can greatly improve post-event network performance. We formulate an optimal electrical distribution grid design problem as a two-stage, stochastic mixed-integer program with damage scenarios from natural disasters modeled as a set of stochastic events. We develop and investigate the tractability of an exact and several heuristic algorithms based on decompositions that are hybrids of techniques developed by the AI and operations research communities. We provide computational evidence that these algorithms have significant benefits when compared with commercial, mixed-integer programming software.																			2159-5399	2374-3468					2015							1233	1240																WOS:000485625501038

We present an (mixed) integer mathematical approach that consists of several methodologies. To address the high dimensionality we use Benders' decomposition, and in parallel a Branch-and-Bound method and a cutting plane approach. Beyond the interest of the proposed approach itself, we have considered and compared two well,known restoration technics as local rerouting and end-to-end rerouting.

Therefore, there is currently demand for designing a robust controller that gives a satisfactory performance in the presence of the different road profiles. This investigation focuses on the design of a discrete-time non-switching networked sliding mode control for the active suspension system, using an event-triggered approach and actuation network delay compensation scheme. A novel event-triggered proportional-integral (PI) sliding variable is built with actuation network delay compensation in the presence of system uncertainties. The discrete-time non-switching networked sliding mode control law is designed using a novel sliding variable, and the control actions at the controller side are updated based on the event generation. The event generator block in the feedback channel increases the communication rate and reduces network congestion by restricting the transmission of unnecessary data packets. The random actuation network delay in the forward and feedback channel is modeled using the Poisson distribution and compensated using the Thiran's approximation technique. The stability of the closed-loop system is derived using the proposed control law that ensures the finite-time convergence of the system state variables within the specified sliding band. Furthermore, the proposed controller is validated on an active suspension system in the presence of network abnormalities and system uncertainties. Numerical results inferred that the proposed control strategy with event-triggered approach and actuation network delay compensation scheme outperforms as considered the Gao's reaching law, conventional non-switching reaching law, or the control strategy without actuation network delay compensation.

Our service exploits a technique called distributed partial mixing to dynamically adapt to varying numbers of speakers and network congestion. A collection of networked audio mixers is arranged as a distributed graph. Each mixes subsets of its input audio streams into one or more mixed streams, which it forwards along with any unmixed streams. This reduces network traffic but at the cost of also reducing audio quality. An experiment demonstrates how our implementation dynamically manages the trade-off between congestion and audio quality when compared to the approaches of peer-to-peer forwarding and total mixing. We also demonstrate how our approach can be realised in a way that is fair to the TCP protocol and so operates as a "good Internet citizen".

This is particularly relevant for embedded systems based on multi core/processor (i.e. parallel) architectures. In such a context, this work focuses on Network on Chip (NoC) architectures and proposes a hardware mechanism designed to be introduced directly into network interfaces. Such a mechanism supports the isolation of multiple tasks with different criticality levels by controlling the exchange of messages while introducing very limited overhead on the monitored NoC. Then, the proposed mechanism is analyzed by means of two different simulations approaches for behavior validation, feasibility check, and scalability evaluation. The overall results show that the proposed mechanism is suitable to support mixed-criticality parallel embedded systems based on NoC architectures.

This discrete model is validated by comparing the results with experiments and those obtained using a continuum model, for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane in Pd/-alumina catalyst particles. The results show that pore blocking has a significant effect on the effectiveness factor and can contribute to up to 50% of the hysteresis loop area for multiphase reactions in porous catalysts, indicating that pore blocking must be accounted for. Moreover, the pore blocking effects are significantly enhanced when the pore network is poorly connected and the pore-size distribution is wide, while the pore blocking effects are insensitive to the volume-averaged pore size. Multiphase catalyst material characterization and design should account for this effect.

In this article, we design arcs in a network to optimize the cost of single-commodity flows under random demand and arc disruptions. We minimize the network design cost plus cost associated with network performance under uncertainty evaluated by two schemes. The first scheme restricts demand and arc capacities in budgeted uncertainty sets and minimizes the worst-case cost of supply generation and network flows for any possible realizations. The second scheme generates a finite set of samples from statistical information (e.g., moments) of data and minimizes the expected cost of supplies and flows, for which we bound the worst-case cost using budgeted uncertainty sets. We develop cutting-plane algorithms for solving the mixed-integer nonlinear programming reformulations of the problem under the two schemes. We compare the computational efficacy of different approaches and analyze the results by testing diverse instances of random and real-world networks. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Dynamic Fault Tree (DFT) analysis method is applied to the safety design of the IMA core processing system to ensure that the system design meets the safety requirements of aircraft. However, Dynamic Fault Tree Analysis (DFTA) requires a lot of manual effort, it will cause the state space explosion and low calculation accuracy, which makes it time-consuming and expensive. This paper presents a dynamic fault tree analysis based on Discrete-Time Bayesian Network (DTBN). Aimed at verifying the characteristics of the presented approach, we conduct a comparative experiment on the accuracy of calculating top events probability under DTBN method and Markov chain analysis method. Finally, we draw the conclusion that the DTBN method has higher accuracy and can effectively avoid space-and-state explosion at the same time.																			2327-0594		978-1-7281-6579-0				2020							335	338		10.1109/icsess49938.2020.9237725	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icsess49938.2020.9237725													WOS:000662226500071

The efficiency and independence of attention networks have been widely tested with the attention network test (ANT) and its revised versions. However, many studies have failed to find effects of attention network scores (ANSs) and inter-network relationships (INRs). Moreover, the low reliability of ANSs can not meet the demands of theoretical and empirical investigations. Two methodological factors (the inter-trial influence in the event-related design and the inter-network interference in orthogonal contrast) may be responsible for the unreliability of ANT. In this study, we combined the mixed design and non-orthogonal method to explore ANSs and directional INRs. With a small number of trials, we obtained reliable and independent ANSs (split-half reliability of alerting: 0.684; orienting: 0.588; and executive control: 0.616), suggesting an individual and specific attention system. Furthermore, mutual inhibition was observed when two networks were operated simultaneously, indicating a differentiated but integrated attention system. Overall, the reliable and individual specific ANSs and mutually inhibited INRs provide novel insight into the understanding of the developmental, physiological and pathological mechanisms of attention networks, and can benefit future experimental and clinical investigations of attention using ANT.

Design of a Mix Network using Connectivity Index - a Novel Privacy Enhancement Approach	2014 28TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED INFORMATION NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS WORKSHOPS (WAINA)					28th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (IEEE WAINA)	MAY 13-16, 2014	Univ Victoria, Victoria, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Tech Comm Distributed Proc, IEEE Comp Soc	Univ Victoria			Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PET) are key to the success in building the trust among the users of the digital world. Enhancing the communication privacy is getting attention nowadays. In this direction, anonymity schemes such as mix, mix networks, onion routing, crowds etc., have started in roads into the deployment at individual and community network levels. To measure the effectiveness and accuracy of such schemes, degree of anonymity is proposed as a privacy metric in literature. To measure the degree of anonymity, many empirical techniques are proposed. We observe that these techniques are computationally intensive and are infeasible for real-time requirements and thus may not be suitable to measure the degree of anonymity under the dynamic changes in the configuration of the network in real-time. In this direction, we propose a novel lightweight privacy metric to measure the degree of anonymity for mix, mix networks and their variants using graph theoretic approach based on Connectivity Index (CI). Further, we also extend this approach with Weighted Connectivity Index (WCI) and have demonstrated the usefulness of the metric through analytical analysis.																					978-1-4799-2652-7				2014							512	517		10.1109/WAINA.2014.86	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WAINA.2014.86													WOS:000365294100085

The design goal is to minimize the upper bound for the anisotropic norm of the input-to-estimation error system. The sensors are supposed to be objects with dropouts of given probability values.

The port rotation directions of ship routes not only affect the transit time of containers, as has been recognized by the literature, but also the shipping capacity and transshipment cost. This paper aims to obtain the optimal port rotation directions that minimize the generalized network-wide cost including transshipment cost, slot-purchasing cost and inventory cost. A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed for the optimal port rotation direction optimization problem and it nests a minimum cost multi-commodity network flow model. The proposed model is applied to a liner shipping network operated by a global liner shipping company. Results demonstrate that real-case instances could be efficiently solved and significant cost reductions are gained by optimization of port rotation directions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To solve this problem, a novel augmented leader-following information fusion strategy is first proposed to collect measurements and system matrices. Then, a class of distributed state estimators is developed with bounded estimation error covariances. Further, a closed-form relation between the designed distributed estimator and the centralized estimator is established. It is found that the estimation performance of the former converges to that of the latter when the consensus gain tends to infinity. The proposed estimator is further extended to the fully distributed case by introducing an adaptive law for the consensus gain without using any global information. Moreover, it is shown that the designed estimator is applicable for systems with deterministic noise. Finally, several comparative numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the theoretical results.

J	Xia, HL; Gao, XK				Xia, Hailun; Gao, Xinkai			Multi-Scale Mixed Dense Graph Convolution Network for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition	IEEE ACCESS												In skeleton-based action recognition, the approaches based on graph convolutional networks(GCN) have achieved remarkable performance by modeling spatial-temporal graphs to explore the physical dependencies between body joints. However, these methods mostly apply hierarchical GCNs to aggregate wider-range neighborhood information, which makes joint features be weakened during long diffusion. In this paper, we design a multi-scale mixed dense graph convolutional network (MMDGCN) to overcome both shortcomings. We propose a dense graph convolution operation to enhance the local context information of joints, and then the spatial and temporal attention modules with a larger receptive field are introduced to help the model strengthen the discriminative features to adaptively refine the intermediate feature maps. We also design a multi-scale mixed temporal convolution module, which provides a flexible temporal graph through the combination of different scale convolution kernels. Extensive experiments on the three real-world datasets (NTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D120 and Kinetics) demonstrate that the performance of the proposed MMDGCN in skeleton-based action recognition.																			2169-3536						2021	9						36475	36484		10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3049029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3049029													WOS:000626501000001

The phenomena of ROQ and missing measurements are governed by a Bernoulli distributed stochastic sequence. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a state estimator such that the dynamics of the estimation error is exponentially stable in the mean square and the prescribed H-infinity performance constraint is satisfied. By constructing proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and employing stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the existence of the desired estimator. Furthermore, the explicit expression of the gain of the desired estimator is described in terms of the solution to a conVex optimization problem that can be easily solved by using the semi-definite programme method.

Consider the special case of impedance matching which could significantly simplify the multimode representation on port and remove the requirement on calculating port impedance. N single-ended ports of a network are regarded as one generalized multimode port, supporting N orthonormal modes represented by N orthonormal basis vectors, respectively. By doing this, in antenna and RF component designs, one can only focus on specific modes interested, while ignore others. A multiport network's characteristics could be represented and understood in a much simpler manner because fewer but more intuitive physical quantities are considered. Therefore, this can significantly simplify the analysis, design, and optimization of multiport networks. For better illustration, several examples, including branch-line coupler, mixed-mode case, sequential rotation feeding antenna, and monopulse feed are analyzed and designed. Complicated analyses in network design using the single-ended S-parameters, including matching, amplitude and phase unbalance, could be converted into much simpler ones from the generalized multimode perspective.

However, the uncertainty and complexity of design parameters, such as the SiO2/Na2O mole ratio in alkaline solution, the alkaline solution concentration in liquid phase, and the liquid-to-fly ash mass ratio (L/F), have made it very difficult to create a systematic approach for geopolymer mix design. These mix design parameters, along with fly ash properties and curing conditions (temperature and time), significantly influence key properties of the material, such as setting time and compressive strength. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to develop models for predicting the key properties of high-calcium fly ash-based geopolymer according to its mix design parameters. The correlations between experimental measurements and ANN model predictions of setting time, compressive strength, and heat of geopolymerization were established based on the results of tests on 36, 273, and 72 geopolymer mixes, respectively. The results show that the correlations between the experimental measurements and ANN model predictions of the properties studied are all strong. ANN modeling was found to be a suitable computing method to analyze the effects of design parameters on geopolymer properties and showed thatL/Fexhibited the greatest effect on setting time, alkaline solution concentration had the greatest influence on compressive strength, and a mole ratio larger than 1.5 significantly impacted heat at the geopolymerization peak. The developed ANN models can be used as guidance for mix design of high-calcium fly ash geopolymer in engineering applications.

Heuristics for urban road network design: Lane layout and signal settings	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH					International Conference on Modelling and Simulation of Business Systems	MAY 13-14, 2003	VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV, VILNIUS, LITHUANIA	Kaunas Univ Technol, Inst Math & Informat, Law Univ Lithuania, Lithuanian Operat Res Soc, Baltic Operat Res Soc	VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV			This paper concerns the urban road network design problem. In urban areas supply has usually been unable to keep pace with increasing demand: the only possibility is often to reorganise the current supply configuration in order to use existing resources efficiently. Thus, in urban areas signal settings and network topology (in particular lane layout) are the two major factors that can be handled by design models. Methods for the combined design of signal settings and topology are proposed in this paper. All the methods proceed in two stages: the first deals with integer variables (topology), while the second deals with continuous variables (signal settings). Some metaheuristics (Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms and Path Relinking) are specified for the topology design stage, and they are used singularly or jointly. The continuous part of the solution, with fixed topology is optimized through an algorithm for asymmetrical deterministic equilibrium assignment. This paper focuses on evaluating performances obtained by all the different algorithms proposed for the topology design stage. The algorithms are compared by applications to real networks, and some conclusions are drawn about their efficiency. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using available output measurements, the state estimator can approximate the neuron states, and the asymptotic property of the state error is mean square exponential stable and also almost surely exponential stable in the presence of discrete and distributed delays. Under the Lipschitz assumptions for the activation functions and the measurement nonlinearity, a delay-dependent linear matrix inequality (LMI) criterion is proposed to guarantee the existence of the desired estimators by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. It is shown that the existence conditions and the explicit expression of the state estimator can be parameterised in terms of the solution to a LMI.

The studied systems are in discrete-time form and unknown time-delay is considered here. Up to now, the research works on nonlinear discrete-time main focus on systems without time-delay, so the problem of the unknown time-delay will be solved in this paper. Based on the Lipschitz or norm-boundedness assumption of the unknown nonlinearities, the mean-value theorem is utilized to solve the unknown time-delay problem. In order to overcome the noncausal problem, the strict-feedback systems will be transformed into a special form. The radial basis functions neural networks (RBFNN) are utilized to approximate the unknown functions of the systems, the adaptation laws and the controllers are designed based on the transformed systems. By using the Lyapunov analysis, it is proven that the closed-loop system is stable in the sense that semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) and the output tracking errors converge to a bounded compact set. A simulation example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, we consider the problem of hose-based cross-layer network design, which seeks to find a minimum cost design that is able to route demand for all hose traffic matrices under all specified failure states. While most network design problems are solved as Mixed Integer Programs, a commercial solver can become intractable due to the scale of today's networks. We demonstrate how the classic Benders decomposition algorithm can be applied and improved for this problem and discuss practical implementation aspects. We showcase a horizontally scalable distributed framework to leverage the decomposable problem structure and solve millions of linear programs in a distributed manner, thereby making the network design problem tractable. In contrast to the conventional approach where failure states and traffic matrices are planned sequentially, the Benders algorithm finds global optimal designs across all traffic matrices and failure states. This leads to network designs with improved solution quality and reliability, with 20-30% less IP capacity and spectrum consumption, 50% less link augments and up to 20x faster runtime that enables design for hyper scale networks in a matter of hours.																					979-8-4007-0236-5				2023							333	345		10.1145/3603269.3604854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3603269.3604854													WOS:001116971100023

J	Feng, MZ; Su, JB				Feng, Mingzheng; Su, Jianbo			Sparse mixed attention aggregation network for multimodal images fusion tracking	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE												Recent years have witnessed the exciting performance of trackers based on Transformer. However, they usually separate the process of information extraction and integration, weakening the information interaction between the target and search region. In addition, they depend on traditional Transformer to model the long range dependency, which leads to a lack of focus on the primary information needed by high-accuracy trackers. In this paper, a sparse mixed attention aggregation model is proposed for robust tracking based on visible and thermal infrared images. To be specific, a backbone network composed of sparse mixed attention is designed to achieve information extraction and integration. This is helpful to obtain specific discriminative feature information and enhance their communication. To give full play to the complementary visible and thermal information, a confidence aware aggregation network is designed, which can learn the reliable confidence of visible and thermal branches. Finally, a corner-based localization head is introduced to estimate the target state. Extensive experiments on three large-scale multimodal tracking benchmarks demonstrate the superior tracking ability of the proposed tracker over other advanced trackers.

The problem in the design of a CLSC network is uncertainty in demand, return products and the quality of return products. Scenario analyses are generated to overcome this uncertainty. In contrast to the existing supply chain network design models, a new application of a CLSC network was studied in this paper to reduce waste. A multi-product, multi-tier mixed integer linear model is developed for a CLSC network design. The main objective is to maximize profit and provide waste management decision support in order to minimize pollution. The result shows applicability of the model in the tire industry.

The wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks may cost-effectively support the growing heterogeneity of traffic demands by having mixed line rates (MLR) over different wavelength channels. The coexistence of wavelength channels with different line rates in the same fiber brings up the important issue of the choice of the channel spacing that one can have in these MLR networks. The channel spacing affects the signal quality in terms of bit-error rate (BER), and hence affects the maximum reach of the lightpaths, which is a function of line rates. Various approaches to set an opportunistic width of the channel spacing can be considered: i) on a practical side, one may choose uniform fixed channel spacing specified by the ITU-T grid (typically 50 GHz); ii) alternatively, to optimize the usage of the fiber spectrum, one can explore different channel spacing for different line rates, also referred to as the "one-size-does-not-fit-all" approach; iii) else an optimal value of channel spacing that leads to minimum cost can be sought. In this work, we investigate the third case by evaluating the cost of a MLR network for different channel spacings. Our results show that, even under the assumption of uniform channel spacing for a MLR network, it is possible to identify optimal values of channel spacing for a minimum-cost MLR network design.

Spare-channel design problems can be formulated as a linear-programming (LP) problem when variables are assumed to be continuous. For the problem, the proposed algorithm effectively solves a sub-set of whole constraints by making use of a maximum-flow algorithm in an iterative manner. It is shown that the maximum number of iteration times is limited by the number of links in the network. Moreover, the relation between the design function and the self-healing function is discussed. It is also shown that the cooperation of the two functions can realize more effective control in large scale networks.																			0916-8516	1745-1345				JUL	1992	E75B	7					624	633																WOS:A1992JF79100013

We consider the Core-Edge reference topology and present two formulations for the Core-Edge storage area network design problem. One formulation excludes explicit host/device connections to the edge (as is common in currently available heuristics), the other includes these connections to allow the modeling of multiple disjoint paths between hosts and devices. These formulations include generic component types to reduce the number of constraints and variables, with the properties of these components being determined as part of the solution process. The size of the formulation is further reduced by a preprocessing method that removes suboptimal switches and links from consideration. We test our formulations on a randomly generated set of problems, all of which are of a size consistent with those encountered in industry. We generate solutions using our two formulations for all test problems in good time. Finally we apply a relaxation of one of our formulations to re-configure the Cecil back-end network, which is currently used across the University of Auckland. We present two designs for the re-configured network to significantly increase reliability and scalability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In view of the nonlinear discrete states of the teleoperation system in packet-switched communication networks, a new discrete sliding mode control (DSMC) strategy is performed via a new reaching law in task space. The new reaching law is designed to reduce the chattering and improve control performance. Moreover, an adaptive extended state observer (AESO) is used to estimate the total system disturbances. The additional gain of AESO is adjusted in time to decrease the estimation errors of both system states and disturbances automatically and improve the estimation performances of the AESO. Finally, the validity of the designed control strategy is demonstrated by both simulation and experiments. Furthermore, the experimental comparison results indicate that the improvement is achievable with the proposed AESO and DSMC.

The essential step is translating SysML-based specifications into Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) which enables rigorous static and dynamic system analysis as well as formal verification of the behavior and functionality of the SysML-based design. A set of tools have been studied and integrated that enable a structured architecture design process. Some basic principles of executable system architecture for discrete event system modeling that guide the process of executable architecture specification and analysis are discussed This paradigm is aimed at general system design Its feasibility was demonstrated with a C4-type network centric system as an example. The simulation results was used to check the overall integrity and internal consistency of the architecture models, refine the architecture design, and, finally, verify the behavior and functionality of the system being modeled.																					978-1-4244-2149-7				2008							80	87																WOS:000257097600013

This study deals with the problem of asymptotic tracking and dynamic regulation of single-input single output (SISO) non-linear systems via output feedbacks by the discrete multi-dimensional Taylor network (MTN) controller, a novel controller with fixed structure and sampled-data control mechanism. For verification of its validity, differential geometry and polynomial approximation are adopted. Using the emulation technique and regional pole assignment, the asymptotic tracking and dynamic regulation without online optimisation of the system by discrete MTN controller is tested. With the dynamic change of error signals, the dynamic regulation by given index is realised. As a convex optimisation problem, the controller parameters can be acquired by parametric learning. Based on the delta operator model, the procedure of the controller design is given in detail. Simulation results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				JUN 23	2017	11	10					1619	1626		10.1049/iet-cta.2017.0100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2017.0100													WOS:000403092500015

An extended plant consisting of a given plant and a dynamical filter is considered and controlled by an event-triggered static output feedback. The triggering rule uses only the available signals and therefore is based on the difference between the triggered and non-triggered output signals. The paper deals with the co-design problem, that is the design of the triggering condition, the filter, and the controller simultaneously. Sufficient theoretical conditions are proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Convex optimizations problems incorporate these conditions in order to optimize the closed-loop performance or to reduce the number of transmissions. Three numerical examples illustrate the design method of the triggering conditions as well as the simultaneous design method of the filter and controller. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

A parametric study on aerodynamic performances of the centrifugal compressor with the inclined discrete cavities was conducted with six geometrical parameters. Through the parametric study, three geometric parameters were selected as design variables for optimization. Peak adiabatic efficiency and stall margin were selected as objective functions. The Latin hypercube sampling method was used to select the design points, and the radial basis neural network was used to construct surrogate models of the objective functions. A hybrid method combining the particle swarm optimization showed better overall performance in finding global optimum than the genetic algorithm.

J	Chae, S; Huang, D; Nguang, SK				Chae, Seunghwan; Huang, Dan; Nguang, Sing Kiong			ROBUST PARTIALLY MODE DELAY-DEPENDENT H<sub>∞</sub> OUTPUT FEEDBACK CONTROL OF DISCRETE-TIME NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												In this paper, a methodology for designing an H output feedback controller for discrete-time networked control systems has been considered. More precisely, network-induced delays between the sensor and the controller is modelled by a Markov chain with transition probabilities which are not assumed to be fully known. The systems parameter uncertainties are assumed to be norm-bounded and possibly time-varying. To the best of the authors knowledge, the problem of designing a partially mode delay-dependent H output feedback controller for NCSs with partially known transition probability matrix has not been investigated in the literature. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, sufficient conditions for the existence of a robust partially mode delay-dependent H output feedback controller are given in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities which can be solved using a cone complementarity linearization algorithm. The proposed design methodology differs from the existing design methodologies in that dynamic output feedback controllers are parameterized by both modes and transition probabilities, as opposed to the existing design approaches which parameterize controllers by modes only. The results obtained reduce to the existing results on fully known transition matrices when transition probabilities are fully known. It is shown that the proposed methodology can be applied to real world systems. The proposed design methodology is verified by using a DC servo motor system where the plant and the controller are connected via a cellular network with partially known transition probability matrix.

J	Iyer, S; Singh, SP				Iyer, Sridhar; Singh, Shree Prakash			Investigation of launch power and regenerator placement effect on the design of mixed-line-rate (MLR) optical WDM networks	PHOTONIC NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS												In recent years, owing to the consistent increase in volume and heterogeneity of the traffic, telecommunication networks have undergone significant innovations. Existing studies have shown that, by adopting a mixed-line-rate (MLR) strategy, wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks can cost-effectively respond to the diverse variety of traffic requirements which haveheterogeneousservice demands. However, due to the existence of physical layer impairments [specifically cross-phase modulation (XPM)], adjacent channels on different line rates may exhibit serious degradation of signal quality and optical reach. In such cases, launch power governs the bit-error rate as it affects both the signal and the noise power due to XPM. Therefore, an intelligent choice of launch power on different line rates can significantly reduce the network cost. Further, in MLR optical networks, trade-off between regenerator placement and the launch power attains importance and needs to be addressed. In this work, we investigate the launch power and regenerator placement effect on the design of a MLR WDM optical network. The obtained simulation results show that the network cost is (i) mainly controlled by power values of the 10/100/400 Gbps channels, and (ii) decreases for a cost model in which, compared to 10 G transponders, high-bit-rate transponders have higher cost decay. Further, with a lower cost model, it is found that more numbers of regenerators can be deployed, simultaneously minimizing the network cost.

It is trained online and is used to estimate the states of the system especially when there is no prior knowledge about the dynamics of the system and can be applied as a basis for designing an intelligent control. The weight updating for the MLP is the developed backpropagation algorithm. Online training, convergence of the observer error to neighborhood of origin, robustness against uncertainties and disturbance, low computational expense and fast convergence rate are the main qualities of the suggested method. Lyapunov's direct method is used to guarantee the stability of the proposed system. To demonstrate the performance of the discrete-time MLP observer, two discrete-time nonlinear dynamic systems are simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results confirm the proficiency of the system even at different operating conditions and the presence of disturbance and measurement noise.

Both the full-order FE observer (FFEO) and the reduced-order FE observer (RFEO) are presented. The objective of this paper is to establish a novel framework of the FE observer with less conservatism. First, under the multiconstrained design, an FFEO is proposed to achieve FE for discrete-time T-S fuzzy models. Then, using a specific coordinate transformation, an RFEO is constructed, which results in a new fault estimator to realize FE using current output information. Furthermore, by the piecewise Lyapunov function approach, less conservative results on both FFEO and RFEO are derived by introducing slack variables. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the advantages of the theoretic results that are obtained in this paper.

J	Lee, D; Pan, R				Lee, Dongjin; Pan, Rong			A nonparametric Bayesian network approach to assessing system reliability at early design stages	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY												It is important to predict a system's reliability at its early design stages because modifying design to improve reliability and maintainability at a later time in the system's lifecycle will be costly and, oftentimes, impossible. However, this early prediction is challenging because of the lack of reliability data and the incomplete knowledge of a complex system's reliability structure. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a nonparametric Bayesian network approach. Employing nonparametric Bayesian network, the limitation of discrete Bayesian network can be overcome, and it can be used as a useful tool for decision support.

However, most conventional non-linear control theory is based on explicit model of controlled object and often resulting in complexity. Besides, the control parameters tuning is mainly aiming at stability of the system. No valid direct performance-oriented nonlinear control theory has been proposed. Facing the limitations, this paper presents a direct motor position control in an implicit data-driven manner. Unlike conventional non-linear motor controls that are based on explicit models and with stability-based parameters tuning, this study gives performance-oriented non-linear control by mastering non-linear discrete optimal control law in an implicit data-learning manner. Firstly, optimal data of position tracking problem is obtained by solving optimization problem. Secondly, the implicit discrete optimal control law hidden in data is learned by a BP neural network. Finally, the learned control law is implemented in real-time control to reproduce optimal control performance. Simulation and experiment results validated the feasibility of the data-driven controller, which could be helpful for performance-oriented non-linear control designs. The merits and further improvements are also discussed.

An online adaptive critic design method is proposed to learn the solution of OTCP by constructing an augmented system associated with a discounted performance function, which is composed of the tracking errors and reference trajectory dynamics. Only one neural network (NN) is used as critic module for approximating the performance function in the solution procedure, and thus the architecture is simpler than the typical action-critic structure, which needs more computational load from neural networks. Therefore, by the means of the approximate policy iteration, the tracking errors get converged to a region near zero and the parameters of critic module get converged to the optimal ones based on our proposed method. Both the convergence of the NN weights and the stability of the tracking error dynamics are guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Two simulation examples are proposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For wireless sensor networks, one of the most important design goals is the maximization of network lifetime. Scalability, on the other hand, is also of utmost importance for any given network design problem and especially in a wide area smart grid deployment scenario. Improving scalability requires the network flows to be more localized, however, localizing network operations works against the utilization of some optimal paths required for load balancing and lifetime prolonging. Therefore, lifetime maximization and scalability are two design criteria acting against each other. In this study, a characterization of achievable network lifetime as a function of level of localization of the routing operations under optimal conditions is performed using three localized routing approaches. We build a novel Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) framework with a special emphasis on the details of energy dissipation terms in sensor nodes to model the network behavior correctly. Numerical analysis performed using the developed MIP framework enables us to quantify the impact of different levels of route localization on network lifetime. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A novel concept of H-infinity cluster synchronization is proposed to quantify against the exogenous disturbance of the complex networks. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, H-infinity cluster synchronization criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The solvability of derived conditions depends not only on the attenuation level but also the initial values of complex networks. The H-infinity state estimation is studied for the same complex networks with the purpose of designing a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A system of shared autonomous vehicles for Chicago: Understanding the effects of geofencing the service	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND LAND USE												With autonomous vehicles (AVs) still in the testing phase, researchers and planners must resort to simulation techniques to explore possible futures regarding shared and automated mobility. An agent based discrete-event transport simulator, POLARIS, is used in this study to simulate travel in the 20-county Chicago region with a shared AV (SAV) mobility option. Using this framework, the effect of an SAV fleet on system performance when constrained to serve within geofences is studied under four distinct scenarios: service restricted to the city, to the city plus suburban core, to the core plus exurban areas, and to the entire region - along with the choice of dynamic ridesharing (DRS) versus solo travel in an SAV. Results indicate that service areas need a balanced mix of trip generators and attractors, and an SAV fleet's empty VMT (eVMT) can be noticeably reduced through suitable geofencing and DRS. Geofences can also help lower response times, reduce systemwide VMT across all modes, and ensure uniform access to SAVs. DRS is most useful in lowering VMT and %eVMT that arises from sprawled land development, but with insufficient demand to share rides, savings from the use of geofences is higher. Geofences targeting neighborhoods with high trip density bring about low response times and %eVMT, but fleet sizes in these regions need to be designed for uniformly low response times throughout a large region, as opposed to maximizing vehicle use in a 24-hour					Gurumurthy, Krishna Murthy/AGE-8041-2022; Kockelman, Kara/ABF-7223-2021	Gurumurthy, Krishna Murthy/0000-0001-6791-4948; 													1938-7849						2021	14	1					933	948		10.5198/jtlu.2021.1926	http://dx.doi.org/10.5198/jtlu.2021.1926													WOS:000702895400007
J	Bakule, L; Papík, M				Bakule, Lubomir; Papik, Martin			Decentralized control and communication	ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL												In this paper, the past and current issues involved in the design of decentralized networked control systems are reviewed. The basic models of interconnected systems described as continuous-time linear time-invariant systems in the time domain serve as a framework for the inclusion of communication channels in the decentralized feedback loop. The I/O-oriented models and the interaction oriented models with disjoint subsystems and interactions are distinguished. The overview is focused on packet dropouts, transmission delays, and quantization effects which are included in the time-driven design of feedback loop components. Single- and multiple-packet transmissions are considered in this contents. The design of decentralized state feedback gain matrices with delayed feedback uses the methodology of sampled-data feedback design for continuous-time systems, while the decentralized H-infinity quantizer design is based on the static output controller. The Liapunov stability approach results in computationally efficient decentralized control design strategies described by using linear matrix inequalities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, network analysis approaches, such as the exponential random graph model (ERGM), have been increasingly used in this field. While the ERGM-based approach has the new capability of modelling the effects of interactions and interdependencies (e.g., social relationships among customers) on customers' decisions via network structures (e.g., using triangles to model peer influence), existing research can only model customers' consideration decisions, and it cannot predict individual customer's choices, as what the traditional utility-based discrete choice models (DCMs) do. However, the ability to make choice predictions is essential to predicting market demand, which forms the basis of decision-based design (DBD). This paper fills this gap by developing a novel ERGM-based approach for choice prediction. This is the first time that a network-based model can explicitly compute the probability of an alternative being chosen from a choice set. Using a large-scale customer-revealed choice database, this research studies the customer preferences estimated from the ERGM-based choice models with and without network structures and evaluates their predictive performance of market demand, benchmarking the multinomial logit (MNL) model, a traditional DCM. The results show that the proposed ERGM-based choice modelling achieves higher accuracy in predicting both individual choice behaviours and market share ranking than the MNL model, which is mathematically equivalent to ERGM when no network structures are included. The insights obtained from this study further extend the DBD framework by allowing explicit modelling of interactions among entities (i.e., customers and products) using network representations.																			2053-4701					MAR 24	2023	9								e7	10.1017/dsj.2023.4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/dsj.2023.4													WOS:000955627900001

Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN), we successfully approximate temperature maps at arbitrary channel locations and time steps. The model is specifically designed for mixed convection at Reynolds number 100, Rayleigh number 3.9 x 106, and Richardson number 88.8. To investigate the impact of the discriminator network architecture on model accuracy, we compare Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classifiers with PatchGAN classifiers, both with and without strided convolutions. Remarkably, the cGAN with PatchGAN based classifier (without strided convolutions) yields the highest clarity and accuracy in inferring temperature maps. Additionally, other factors such as image contrast, spatiotemporal variation rate of temperature, and the number of channels in the temperature image significantly influence cGAN accuracy. This work highlights the potential of deep learning in efficiently modeling complex transport processes.

Nowadays, the monolithic integrated circuits become predominant, and following this, the classical circuit design has been shifted to advanced techniques both in time-, frequency and mixed domains.

This mechanism allows the application to reconfigure PROC on runtime. PROC also provides fault-tolerance mechanisms to ensure reliable routes. A performance evaluation in topologies varying from 50 to 200 nodes showed that PROC increases network lifetime around 7% to 12%, and has a higher throughput than both energy-aware data-centric routing (EAD) and a simplified version of TinyOS Beaconing.

The efficiency of the traffic network and the reduction of pollution in the network environment are improved by designing a reasonable road capacity enhancement and speed limit strategy. A biobjective bilevel programming model is developed to formulate the proposed network design problem. The first target of the upper problem is the optimization of road charging efficiency, and the other target is the total cost of vehicle emissions; these objectives are required to devise the optimal road capacity enhancement scheme, speed limiting schemes for different time periods, and the road pricing scheme. The lower-level problem involving travellers' route choice behaviours uses stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) theory. Based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, which is applied to solve the bilevel programming model, a numerical example is developed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The results show that the implementation of congestion charging measures on the congested road sections would help to alleviate road congestion in the transportation network, effectively save transportation infrastructure investment and limited urban land resources, increase fiscal revenue, and open up new sources of funds for urban infrastructure construction.

The parametric estimation is designed to be adaptive, which greatly improves the control ability. During the control process, the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) method is used to do the estimation of the control parameters, and the controller is fixed as a neural network here. In this paper, the proposed control strategy is applied to solve nonlinear tracking problems for discrete-time nonlinear systems, as well as nonlinear near-optimal control problems. The traditional model-free control strategy is introduced for comparison, and the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed adaptive data driven control strategy is well demonstrated through simulation comparison results.

J	Bumblauskas, D				Bumblauskas, Daniel			A Markov decision process model case for optimal maintenance of serially dependent power system components	JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING												Purpose - Using a case study for electrical power equipment, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the importance of dependence between series-connected system components in maintenance decisions. Design/methodology/approach - A continuous-time Markov decision model is formulated to find a minimum cost maintenance policy for a circuit breaker as an independent component while considering a downstream transformer as a dependent component. Maintenance of the dependent component is included implicitly in terms of the costs associated with certain state-action pairs. For policy and cost comparisons, a separate model is also formulated that considers only the circuit breaker as the independent component. After uniformizing the continuous-time models to discrete time, standard methods are used to solve for the average-cost-optimal policies of each model. Findings - The optimal maintenance policy and its cost differ significantly depending on whether or not the dependent component is considered. Research limitations/implications - Data used are from manufacturer databases; additional model validation could be conducted if applied to an electric utility asset fleet within their generation, transmission, and/or distribution system. This model and methodology are already being applied in other contexts such as industrial machinery and equipment, jet engines, amusement park rides, etc. Practical implications - The outcome of this model can be utilized by asset and operations managers to make maintenance decisions based on prediction rather than more traditional time-or condition-based maintenance methodologies. This model is being developed for use as a module in a larger maintenance information system, specifically linking condition monitor data from the field to a predictive maintenance model. Similar methods are being applied to other applications outside the electrical equipment case detailed herein. Originality/value - This model provides a structured approach for managers to decide how to best allocate their resources across a network of inter-connected equipment. Work in this area has not fully considered the importance of dependency on systems maintenance, particularly in applications with highly variable repair and replacement costs.

For continuous queries where users report their locations periodically, attackers can infer more about users' privacy by analyzing the correlations of their snapshot samples. Traditional privacy-preserving solutions designed in Euclidean space can be hardly applied to the road network environment because of their ignorance of network topological properties. In this paper, we propose a novel continuous query privacy-preserving framework in road networks. Our framework is based on the concepts of k-anonymity and l-diversity. To achieve the quality of service, the distance limitation is taken into account. We build an Snet hierarchy based on the density of users, history traces, and road network topologies to accelerate the cloaking process performed at the anonymization server. Two types of cloaking algorithms, for a single user and a batch of users, are designed. The security analysis shows that our framework is robust to typical attacks. We evaluate our framework from the aspects of privacy-preserving ability, quality of service, and system performance, which indicates that our framework can provide good privacy protection while ensuring users' quality of service.

Conventional text matching methods rely on predefined templates and rules. However, for a short piece of text with a limited number of words, these rules are unable to generalize well to unobserved data. With the success of deep learning in fields like computer vision, speech recognition and recommender systems, many recent efforts have been made to apply deep neural network models to natural language processing tasks to reduce the cost of manual feature engineering. In this paper, we present the design of Multi-Channel Information Crossing (MIX), a multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) model for text matching in a production environment, with additional attention mechanisms on sentences and semantic features. MIX compares text snippets at varied granularities to form a series of multi-channel similarity matrices, which are then crossed with another set of carefully designed attention matrices to expose the rich structures of sentences to deep neural networks. We implemented MIX and deployed the system on Tencent's Venus distributed computation platform. Thanks to the well-engineered multi-channel information crossing, evaluation results suggest that MIX outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art deep neural network models by at least 11.1% in terms of the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG@3), on the English WikiQA dataset. Moreover, we performed online A/B tests with real users on the search service of Tencent QQ Browser. Results show that MIX raised the number of clicks on the returned results by 5.7%, due to the increased accuracy in query-document matching, which demonstrates the superior performance of MIX in a real-world production environment.					liu, dong/GRJ-9115-2022																978-1-4503-5552-0				2018							110	119		10.1145/3219819.3219928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3219928													WOS:000455346400012

J	Hewitt, M				Hewitt, Mike			Enhanced Dynamic Discretization Discovery for the Continuous Time Load Plan Design Problem	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE												For less-than-truckload (LTL) freight transportation carriers, as shipment sizes are small relative to trailer capacity, profitability is driven by the ability to load trailers with shipments from multiple customers. However, LTL carriers are facing increased pressure from customers to provide short delivery times, which limits their ability to hold freight, a critical tactic for consolidation. As consolidation requires the coordination of shipment paths in both space and time, shorter delivery times necessitate planning methods that can accurately estimate consolidation opportunities in time. This paper adapts and enhances the dynamic discretization discovery method designed for solving the scheduled service network design problem, defined on an arbitrarily fine discretization of time, to produce exact and heuristic methods for the LTL analog, the continuous time load plan design problem. With instances from the literature and based on data from a U.S. LTL carrier, we provide computational evidence that the algorithm can effectively solve this problem. With an analysis of high-quality solutions to the instances based on LTL carrier data, we derive insights into terminal staffing policies.

The graph properties complicate the design of synchronization controllers due to the interplay between the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix and the required stabilizing gains. A method is given herein, based on an H-2 type Riccati equation, that decouples the design of the synchronizing gains from the detailed graph properties. A condition for synchronization is given based on the relation of the graph eigenvalues to a bounded circular region in the complex plane that depends on the agent dynamics and the Riccati solution. This condition relates the Mahler measure of the node dynamics system matrix to the connectivity properties of the communication graph. The notion of 'synchronizing region' is used. An example shows the effectiveness of these design methods for achieving synchronization in cooperative discrete-time systems.

Metal matrix superconductor composites for SMES-Driven, ultra high power BEP applications: Part 1	BEAMED ENERGY PROPULSION	AIP Conference Proceedings				4th International Symposium on Beamed Energy Propulsion	NOV 15-18, 2005	Nara, JAPAN	Commemorat Org Japan World Exposit 1970, Tokyo Inst Technol, Entropia Laser Initiat, Inst Laser Technol				A superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) 'battery' of order 025-1 km diameter is designed to demonstrate theoretical feasibility for large scale beamed energy propulsion (BEP) applications, charging at similar to 300e MW from solar or nuclear sources, and discharging the full energy load into a gyrotron network in 1-2 minutes. The superconducting coil, whose storage capacity is 2.5 TJ, is made of structural carbon fiber filaments with a superconducting MgCNi3 high current density film surface layer, imbedded in a high electrical and thermal conductivity stabilizer metal, such as copper and/or beryllium. The SMES energy density is compared to other energy storage means and appears superior at the proposed operations scale and prolonged, frequent cycling duty. It is demonstrated that a toroidal coil with solenoidal winding configuration is most effective in specific energy (J/k-g). Concurrently the high modulus and yield strength of die coil composite perform well for tensile hoop stress along the winding conductors, as well as transversely, to resist a self generated effective external pressure tending to buck-ling conditions in the thin walls. As such the toroid cross-section is re-enforced with periodic discrete rings. To achieve this hyper rigidity, the coil composite requires exclusion of traditional soft insulators (like epoxy), making use of a CVD (with tough metal-bonded Al2O3) continuous process of wire insulation and integration into a coil structural lattice, which ultimately needs to withstand very large quench voltages. The coil is built on a modular inflatable mandrel which is removed after assembly. A Part 2 associated paper treats the electromagnetic problem.																			0094-243X		0-7354-0322-8				2006	830						411	+																WOS:000238124400044

The most striking feature of 2 is that its 2D holed (4,4)-water-net is constructed from hexameric water clusters and two types of dimeric water clusters. Surprisingly, the water net and the metal-organic skeleton are interpenetrated to form a fascinating 3D metal-organic-water supramolecular architecture. A further increase of the pH value leads to another 2D layered framework of 3 containing dumbbell-shaped rings as subunits. Reaction at a strongly alkaline solution leads to a discrete molecule of 4. Meanwhile solid-state properties such as thermal stability and the photoluminescence properties at room temperature for these complexes have also been systematically investigated.

Analysis of driver's response to real-time information in Switzerland	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT-TRASPORTI EUROPEI												We present behavioral models designed to capture the response of drivers to real-time traffic information. In 2003, we have conducted a survey in Switzerland in order to collect both Revealed Preferences (RP) and Stated Preferences (SP) about choice decisions in terms of route and mode. The RP data contains socio-economic characteristics of the individuals in our samples, their actual usage of ITS as well as their actual route and mode choice behavior. The SP data provide us with stated route and mode choices when drivers are faced with different hypothetical choice situations involving real-time information about the state of the network. First we present a Mixed Binary Logit model with panel data to analyze the drivers' decisions when traffic information is provided during their trip by the mean of Radio Data System (RDS) or Variable Message Signs (VMS). This model is referred to en-route choice model. Second we present Nested Logit models capturing the behavior of drivers when they are aware of traffic conditions before their trip. These last models allow to predict pre-trip route choice decisions with regard to route and mode when traffic information is available. The calibrated models are subsequently included in a simulator which predicts travelers' behavior in specific scenarios (described by adjustable parameters) allowing the sensitivity analysis of the demand with regard to the variations of various parameters. In this paper, we discuss the results of the estimation process, including some comments about the Value of Travel Time Savings (VTTS) and present some scenarios developed with our simulator.

To avoid the occurrence of high IRI values in pavement design life, this study improved the current asphalt mix design by introducing a machine learning (ML) model to predict pavement IRI. The data relating to the IRI of flexible pavements were collected from the long-term pavement performance (LTPP) program database. A total of 37 input features about climate condition, traffic, pavement structure, and pavement materials properties were selected based on backward elimination and recursive feature elimination methods. The effect of five different dimensionality reduction techniques on the performance of ML models was analyzed. Six different ML algorithms including support vector regression (SVR), random forest, artificial neural networks (ANN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), Extra-trees, and gradient boosting (GB) were trained to predict IRI, and the performance metrics (R2, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and SI) of these ML models were computed and compared. The IRI criterion and the best IRI prediction model were then added to the asphalt mix design procedure. The results showed that compared to other dimensionality reduction methods, the combination of autoencoders makes ANN and GB perform better. The AE-GPR was the best approach to pre-dicting IRI (R2 = 0.94). The proposed mix design procedure was operated to design the asphalt concrete for the surface layer of a construction project. The predicted IRIs of the initial trial blends (including the traditionally designed mix) do not exceed the range of the IRI criterion in the procedure, and the recommended mixture remains the same as the traditionally designed one.

J	Zhou, XH; Sun, KH; Wang, HH; Yao, Z				Zhou, Xianhui; Sun, Kehui; Wang, Huihai; Yao, Zhao			Coexisting hyperchaos and multistability in a discrete memristor-coupled bi-neuron model	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS												Memristor is a nonlinear electronic component with good plasticity, and it is widely used to function as the synapse. Significantly, the inter-neuronal communication is a discrete process via neurotransmitter, and the discrete memristor is suitable to emulate its dynamics. With the introduction of discrete memristors, the discrete neural models coupled with memristors have received widespread attention. In this paper, we present a one-dimensional (1D) Chialvo map, and a discrete memristor-coupled Chialvo neuron (DMCCN) map is designed by bidirectionally coupling two 1D Chialvo maps through a discrete memristor. The DMCCN map exhibits a linear fixed point set dependent on the initial condition of the memristor, and the stability is discussed. The dynamical behaviors are investigated through Lyapunov exponents (LEs), bifurcation diagrams, phase portraits, and firing patterns. The results indicate that the DMCCN map generates complex dynamical behaviors, such as chaos, hyperchaos and coexisting firing patterns. Specifically, these behaviors are highly dependent on the initial conditions, leading to initial-induced heterogeneous multistability and initial-boosted homogeneous multistability. Furthermore, a hardware circuit based on the DSP platform is designed to implement the DMCCN map, verifying its application potential.																			0924-090X	1573-269X				JUN	2024	112	11					9547	9561		10.1007/s11071-024-09546-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-024-09546-3		APR 2024											WOS:001220469700001

In general, combinatorial problems of this kind are NP hard, which makes its difficult to obtain in optimal, or near optimal solution. Likewise, the design of a dynamic hybrid satellite and terrestrial networks (DHSTN) is a restricted topology network design problem that exhibits similar difficulties in its solution. In this paper two approaches to the dynamic hybrid network design problem are proposed and examined. The first approach is a ratio assignment (AS) approach and the second a non-linear knapsack approach. The main objective is to use a Lagrange Relaxation approach to reduce the transcendental relating constraints in the DHSTN design problem so as to render them solvable.																					0-7803-8601-9				2004							203	208																WOS:000226030500044

It was motivated by the introduction of IP Datacast (lPDC) as a way of offering multicast and broadcast services to mobile or indoor users. We initially stress on Single Frequency Networks (SFN) planning. We have found, based on a theoretical network a maximum value of the allowable inter-transmitter distance (30 kin in our-simulations). Concerning mix networks of SFN and Multi Frequency Network (MFN), we obtain, for a desired coverage area size, the parameter of the SFN clusters. Then we examine the minimum reuse factor K to achieve the desired QoS. We also present sonic design considerations for IPDC networks.																					0-7803-8521-7				2004							3075	3079																WOS:000227931904004
J	Xu, QY; Li, XD				Xu, Qing-Yuan; Li, Xiao-Dong			HONN-Based Adaptive ILC for Pure-Feedback Nonaffine Discrete-Time Systems With Unknown Control Directions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												Nearly all adaptive control techniques require that the control directions of dynamical systems are known in advance. In this paper, for a class of pure-feedback nonaffine discrete-time systems with unknown control directions (UCDs), a high-order neural network (HONN)-based adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) approach is presented to address a repetitive tracking control issue. The implicit function theorem is adopted to cope with the difficulty resulting from the nonaffine structure of control input. Employing a discrete Nussbaum-type function in the neural network weight adaptation law to suit the UCD, an HONN is used to iteratively estimate the ideal control signals. In addition, a novel dead-zone method is developed in the HONN-based adaptive ILC algorithm to enhance its robustness against nonrepetitive desired trajectories and random uncertainties in iterative initial errors and external disturbance. Consequently, the system output, except at the initial $n$ time instants, is demonstrated to asymptotically converge to an adjustable range of the desired trajectory along the iteration axis, while all of the system signals remain bounded during the entire ILC process. Two simulation examples show the feasibility of the adaptive ILC approach.

Because of the universal modeling ability of neural networks, deep learning (DL) techniques are gaining prominence in solving hyperspectral analysis tasks. The autoencoder (AE) network has been extensively investigated in linear blind source unmixing. However, the linear mixing model (LMM) may fail to provide good unmixing performance when the nonlinear mixing effects are nonnegligible in complex scenarios. Considering the limitations of LMM, we propose an unsupervised nonlinear spectral unmixing method, based on autoencoder architecture. Firstly, a deep neural network is employed as the encoder to extract the low-dimension feature of the mixed pixel. Then, the generalized bilinear model (GBM) is used to design the decoder, which has a linear mixing part and a nonlinear mixing one. The coefficient of the bilinear mixing part can be adjusted by a set of learnable parameters, which makes the method perform well on both nonlinear and linear data. Finally, some regular terms are imposed on the loss function and an alternating update strategy is utilized to train the network. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and show very competitive performance compared with several existing algorithms.

Exploiting low overhead compression accompanied by proper routing and aggregation is a challenge for such energy starved multihop network. In this paper, we propose an efficient path merging protocol for wireless multimedia sensor network with randomly deployed nodes. Any partial discrete wavelet transform based compression technique can be plugged into this path merging protocol to reduce redundant data transmission in a significant manner by appropriate aggregation of data packets from merging paths.

We first design decentralized controllers for solving the output synchronization problem for a set of network topologies under arbitrary bounded delay. We then apply the proposed scheme to solve the formation problem with arbitrarily given formation vectors. Finally, we consider the output regulation problem, where the output of each agent has to track an a prior specified reference trajectory, generated by an exosystem. In this case, we assume that the common root agent has access to its own output relative to the reference trajectory. We then solve the problem for a set of network topologies with delay whose upper bound depends exosystem and some characteristic of network topologies.

Based on the hydraulic-electric circuit analogy, we defined an abstract specification using computer-aided designing system. Several approaches, especially circuit partition, were applied to minimize design effort. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was exploited to convert the electrics specification to fabrication model. We automatically designed the combinational-mixing-serial dilution microfluidics to generate parallel stepwise gradients for mixing chemicals (binary/ternary/quaternary mixture) using the present algorithm. We critically discussed design rules and evaluated the microfluidic performance by colorimetric analysis. To examine whether these microfluidic chips can be used for toxicity test on microalgae, single and joint toxic effects of heavy metals (copper, mercury, zinc, and cadmium) were examined on line. In all cases, dose-related toxic responses were successfully detected. These results provided a solution for designing resistive network using circuit partition and CFD-based optimization and a route to develop a promising user-friendly alternative for microalgae bioassays as well as cell-based screening experiments in risk assessment.

J	Dong, PC; Liu, Y; Meng, QC; Yu, GD				Dong, Pengcheng; Liu, Yang; Meng, Qingchun; Yu, Guodong			Reliable network design considering endogenous customers' choices under probabilistic arc failures	IISE TRANSACTIONS												We consider a reliable network design where the facility location and road ban decisions are jointly optimized to minimize the total expected costs and risks against uncertain exogenous arc-dependent failures and customers' endogenous interactions. We formulate endogenous customers' choices by incorporating an expressive measure, Cumulative prospect theory, into the widely used multinomial logit model. Additionally, we use a well-known downside measure, Conditional value-at-risk, for the designer to control integrated risks from exogenous arc failures and endogenous customers' choices. Accordingly, a mixed-integer trilinear program is developed. To solve the model, we first transform it into a class of mixed-integer linear programs based on the separable structure. Then, a customized branch-and-Benders-cut algorithm is proposed to solve these mixed-integer linear programs. We devise a set of novel valid inequalities based on the endogenous transition of choice probability to strengthen the weak relaxation of the master problem. Moreover, by aggregating the grouping and dual iterations shrinking techniques for solving sub-problems, the branch-and-Benders-cut algorithm can converge within 30 seconds and the whole problem can be solved within 15 minutes for a network with 90 nodes and 149 road segments. Some managerial insights for balancing risk and cost are finally extracted.																			2472-5854	2472-5862				FEB 1	2024	56	2					186	200		10.1080/24725854.2023.2209622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24725854.2023.2209622		MAY 2023											WOS:001013468800001

To achieve these models, information about the mixing in the system must be measured to compare with the predicted values. Electrical resistance tomography has the capability to measure spatial and temporal changes within a vessel in three dimensions even in optically inaccessible environments. This paper discusses the creation of a network-of-zones model for the prediction of mixing within a vessel with a Cowles disc-type agitator. Solving of the network-of-zones simplified transport equations for the vessel predicts the concentration distribution of an inert tracer added to the vessel. The change in this distribution with time is calculated and compared with visual inspection of the vessel. The concentration distribution inside the vessel is also measured using electrical resistance tomography and shows good agreement with the predicted values.

Statistics-based approaches are usually employed to address dynamic parameter design problems; however, these approaches have some limitations when applied to dynamic systems with continuous control factors. This study proposes a novel three-phase approach for resolving the dynamic parameter design problems as well as the static characteristic problems, which combines continuous ant colony optimisation (CACO) with neural networks. The proposed approach trains a neural network model to construct the relationship function among response, inputs and parameters of a dynamic system, which is then used to predict the responses of the system. Three performance functions are developed to evaluate the fitness of the predicted responses. The best parameter settings can be obtained by performing a CACO algorithm according to the fitness value. The best parameter settings that are obtained are no longer restricted to the values of control factor levels. The proposed approach is demonstrated with two illustrative examples. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms the Taguchi method.

In addition, a numerical simulation is included to illustrate the effectiveness of the robust control strategy.

The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) is planning on expanding the capacities of some treatment plants and demolishing and replacing others with new ones by 2045. To asses this expansion, the current wastewater network was analyzed and the amount of untreated sewage water that is dumped into the sea was taken into consideration. The current network is composed of twelve main pumping stations and four treatment plants. Using discrete-event simulation, the current and future situations were modeled and the outputs were compared. This gives us a valid base to give recommendations for this large infrastructure project.

In these works, information exchange between the supervisors is either required implicitly by the synchronization of shared events or explicitly by the communication of events or symbols. However, it is not discussed how the communication can be realized if the supervisors are implemented in distributed controller devices that are connected by a communication network. In this paper, we study the synchronization of shared events among distributed supervisors on a switched network. In particular, we develop a communication model that accounts for possible transmission delays, and enables the correct operation of the communicating supervisors.

Joint Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												The concept of hierarchical federated edge learning (H-FEEL) has been recently proposed as an enhancement of federated learning model. Such a system generally consists of three entities, i.e., the server, helpers, and clients, in which each helper collects the trained gradients from clients nearby, aggregates them, and sends the result to the server for global model update. Due to limited communication resources, only a portion of helpers can be scheduled to upload their aggregated gradients in each round of the model training. And that necessitates a well-designed scheme for the joint helper scheduling and communication resources allocation. In this paper, we develop a training algorithm for the H-FEEL system which involves local gradient computing, weighted gradient uploading, and machine learning model updating phases. By characterizing these phases mathematically and analyzing one-round convergence bound of the training algorithm, we formulate an optimization problem to achieve the scheduling and resource allocation scheme. The problem simultaneously captures the uncertainty of the wireless channel and the importance of the weighted gradient. To solve the problem, we first transform it into an equivalent problem and then decompose the transformed problem into two subproblems: bit and sub-channel allocation and helper scheduling, which are mixed integer nonlinear programming and continuous nonlinear problems, respectively. For the first subproblem, we obtain an optimal solution of exponential complexity and a suboptimal solution that has polynomial complexity. For the second subproblem, we obtain a closed-form optimal solution in a special case and a suboptimal solution in the general case. The efficacy of our scheme is amply demonstrated via simulations and the analytical framework is shown to provide valuable design insights for the practical implementation of the H-FEEL system.

A review of the international literature	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL												A Health in All Policies approach requires creating and sustaining intersectoral partnerships for promoting population health. This scoping review of the international literature on partnership functioning provides a narrative synthesis of findings related to processes that support and inhibit health promotion partnership functioning. Searching a range of databases, the review includes 26 studies employing quantitative (n = 8), qualitative (n = 10) and mixed method (n = 8) designs examining partnership processes published from January 2007 to June 2015. Using the Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning as a theoretical framework for analyzing the findings, nine core elements were identified that constitute positive partnership processes that can inform best practices: (i) develop a shared mission aligned to the partners' individual or institutional goals; (ii) include a broad range of participation from diverse partners and a balance of human and financial resources; (iii) incorporate leadership that inspires trust, confidence and inclusiveness; (iv) monitor how communication is perceived by partners and adjust accordingly; (v) balance formal and informal roles/structures depending upon mission; (vi) build trust between partners from the beginning and for the duration of the partnership; (vii) ensure balance between maintenance and production activities; (viii) consider the impact of political, economic, cultural, social and organizational contexts; and (ix) evaluate partnerships for continuous improvement. Future research is needed to examine the relationship between these processes and how they impact the longer-term outcomes of intersectoral partnerships.

To address this issue, a controller directly driven by discrete sample data points is proposed in this paper. First, the input vector for the controller is placed into a state space as a point. The state space also contains points constructed by the input vectors of pre-generated samples, which are created by the GPOPS planning algorithm along with control commands as sample output vectors. Then, an adjacent range is selected and the sample points within are collected. To accelerate the process, a series of data processing methods are implemented, including the dichotomy method, table look-up method, and random selection method. Finally, the control commands are computed using the iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm with the assumption that similar inputs have similar outputs. According to the simulation results, the discrete point controller is more precise than the neural network controller.

The first-stage decisions correspond to those of a classical network design problem, while the second-stage decisions correspond to those of a network construction scheduling problem (NCS) under uncertainty. The resulting problem, which we will refer to as the Two-Stage Robust Network Design and Construction Problem (2SRNDC), aims at providing a modeling framework in which the design decision not only depends on the design costs (e.g., distances) but also on the corresponding construction plan (e.g., time to provide service to costumers). We provide motivations, mixed integer programming formulations, and an exact algorithm for the 2SRNDC. Experimental results on a large set of instances show the effectiveness of the model in providing robust solutions, and the capability of the proposed algorithm to provide good solutions in reasonable running times.

However, existing works still exhibit limitations in terms of trading architecture and pricing schemes. In addition, the existing multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) methods suffer from computational overload caused by the exploration of joint and hybrid action space during centralized training. In this paper, we propose a P2P energy trading paradigm based on hierarchical hybrid MADRL to maximize the trading profits among multiple heterogeneous MGs. First, we design a novel hierarchical structure of the MC agent to model the coupled interaction between flexible demands scheduling and autonomous quotation. Then, a P2P market that employs an improved mid-market rate (IMMR) pricing scheme is proposed to incentivize participation in local trading. Furthermore, to handle hybrid discrete-continuous action space and reduce computational complexity, we propose a hierarchical hybrid multi-agent double deep Q-network and deep deterministic policy gradient (hh-MADDQN-DDPG) algorithm to split the optimal policy learning-workload into a sequence of two sub-tasks. The DDQN for flexible demands scheduling and DDPG for energy trading. Numerical results of simulation I demonstrate that our hh-MADDQN-DDPG with IMMR increases 25% of the trading profits averaged over the baselines. Results of simulation II show that our hh-MADDQN-DDPG provides higher profits compared with the existing methods while maintaining better computational performance and scalability.

The model system has four integrated modules defining household location and automobile choices, commuter workplace and commuting travel choices, noncommuting travel activity, and worker-distributed work practices. The demand model system, estimated as a set of discrete and continuous choice models, is combined with a set of equilibrating criteria in each of the location, automobile, and commuting markets to predict overall demand for passenger travel in various socioeconomic segments, automobile classes, and geographic locations. The current version was developed to operate at a high level of aggregation for the Sydney, Australia, region, including a 14-zone system with a spiderweb network, and is designed to explore the impacts of broad strategic directions. The model. system is embedded within a decision support system to make it an attractive suite of tools for practitioners. The usefulness of TRESIS is illustrated by its application to a major investment option in Northeast Sydney to replace a bottleneck created by the raising of a bridge either with bridge improvements together with improvements to a number of intersections on the roads serving the region or with several possible tunnel options, including different levels of tolls for the tunnels. The application of TRESIS to this case was-considered a success: TRESIS provided a comprehensive regional view of the likely outcomes of the alternatives.

Based on the strictly complete property of the matrices system and the delay-decomposing approach, exploiting a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional decomposing the delays in integral terms, the switching rule depending on the state of the network is designed. Moreover, by piecewise delay method, discussing the Lyapunov functional in every different subintervals, some new delay-dependent robust stability criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which lead to much less conservative results than those in the existing references and improve previous results. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results.

Therefore, to wisely decide the optimal strategy for the repair-and-support ship to enter the MR market of offshore platforms, comparative and competition analyses are made between the repair-and-support ship and shipyard when providing MR services for damaged offshore platforms on a deep sea. Thereafter, a bi-objective optimisation model of profit and market share of the repair-and-support ship based on game theory is formulated, considering the characteristics of the repair-and-support ship as a compound player and its mixed motives in competition. In this model, dispatching and repair prices of the repair-and-support ship and the repair price of the shipyard are considered decision variables. Therefore, focusing on the particularity of this model, a solution method combining pricing game and bi-objective optimisation is designed to obtain a continuous and exact Pareto front, and its proof is provided. A closed-form expression of the Pareto front for profit and market share of the repair-and-support ship is derived. This solution method is compared with a decomposition-based weighted sum method and augmented e-constraint method. The results show that this solution method has advantages in Pareto front size and running time. Finally, some management insights are obtained through numerical simulation. The research results of this study are conducive to the operator of the repair-and-support ship to make wiser decisions on the trade-off between profit and market share. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Bayesian design of concrete with amortized Gaussian processes and multi-objective optimization	CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH												Here, we present a computational framework, combining machine learning models with inverse optimization, which can accelerate and optimize concrete mix design with respect to climate impact and/or cost. Our approach leverages a novel amortized Gaussian process (GP) model trained on a large industry dataset to predict concrete strength based on mix proportions. The resulting GP model has an R2 value, RMSE, and MAPE of -0.88, -909 psi (6.3 MPa), and -10.8 %, respectively. We integrated the GP model with an inverse optimization scheme to predict optimal mix designs that minimize cost and/or climate impact. The results show that this integrated framework can generate reasonable concrete mixes that offer up to -30 % and -60 % reductions in cost and climate impact, respectively, compared with industry mixes with similar 28-day strength. This study highlights the potential environmental and economic benefits of data-driven approaches to designing and optimizing concrete mixes.

By applying the linear matrix inequality (LMI) and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), the novel sufficient condition of globally exponential stability for RNNs with time-varying discrete and distributed delays is derived under the condition of the more general activation function. The new mean-square global asymptotic stability criterion for stochastic fuzzy cellular neural networks (SFCNNs) with timevarying delays is also derived by constructing a new LKF and using Ito's stochastic stability theory. The obtained results are helpful to design the stability of above two systems. Finally, some illustrative examples are given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the results.

Different from conventional sliding mode-based APF current control strategy, high-performance current control can be assured using an integral-type terminal sliding surface to force the tracking error to zero in a finite time. Also, with the aim to reduce the chattering phenomenon owing to the large switching gain for typical sliding mode control, a novel sliding mode control design called continuous terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) is developed to soften the control signals. In addition, the control law is constructed based on meta-cognitive FNN rather than actual systems. Unlike the predefined structure approaches, meta-cognitive FNN can extract useful input data to adjust the networks structure and system parameters. Moreover, the stability and convergence analysis are presented to satisfy the control objectives and system stability requirements at the same time. Experimental results verify that proposed continuous TSMC using meta-cognitive FNN reveal superior features compared with other existing control approaches.																			0967-0661	1873-6939				APR	2021	109								104735	10.1016/j.conengprac.2021.104735	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conengprac.2021.104735		JAN 2021											WOS:000632647200014

The typical double-shell structure for Fe@SiO2@(MnZn)Fe2O4 powders was composed of a SiO2-(MnZn)Fe2O4 mixed outer layer and an SiO2 inner network embedded with trace amounts of (MnZn)Fe2O4. In comparison with Fe@SiO2 SMCs, the Fe@SiO2@(MnZn)Fe2O4 SMCs presented a notable flat high frequency characteristic up to 1 MHz, much higher permeability, and lower core loss which reduced with decreasing (MnZn)Fe2O4 layer thickness. Fe@SiO2@(MnZn)Fe2O4 SMCs prepared with 4 mL (MnZn)Fe2O4 solution exhibited stable permeability of 64.0-63.5 up to 1 MHz and low core loss of 0.9-30.6 W/kg in 1-150 kHz. The strong magnetic coupling between the thin (MnZn) Fe2O4 layer and Fe cores effectively reduced the air-gap thickness and demagnetization field giving rise to a high permeability. The low core loss could be attributed to the full separation of Fe core by thin dielectric electrically insulating magnetic coupled with a SiO2/(MnZn)Fe2O4 insulating layer. Our findings might shed insight on the design of novel SMCs with low core loss and high permeability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A New Scale of Sports Fan Social-Personal Identity Salience (FSPIS) and Its Consequences	COMMUNICATION & SPORT												Based on social identity, self-categorization, and optimal distinctiveness theories, this article argues that fans of team sports clubs (TSCs) may position themselves as members of their TSCs or as unique, individual sports fans. To date, no published, validated instrument has been designed to measure differences in sports fans' personal and social identity orientation. We conducted three studies to test the validity and reliability of the Fan Social-Personal Identity Salience (FSPIS) scale. In the first two, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed. The third study used a structural equation model to test the consequences of the new scale in an extension of the test of its nomological network validity. The data for the current research was collected using three distinct and separate empirical surveys of professional basketball fans in Israel. Our findings show that there is a moderate correlation between social and personal identities, indicating that a low level of social identity is not the same as personal identity. The FSPIS scale predicted fan optimism and satisfaction, which, in turn, partially mediated the effect on involvement. The uniqueness of the proposed scale is that it is a continuous scale that is able to capture mixed identity salience and variations in its magnitude.																			2167-4795	2167-4809				FEB	2023	11	1					28	52	2167479520967278	10.1177/2167479520967278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2167479520967278		OCT 2020											WOS:000583672200001

In this study, a joint optimization of running route and scheduling for responsive feeder transit under mixed demand (i.e., reservation and real-time demands) of the time-dependent road network was investigated. A two-stage optimization method was designed together with considering the mixed demands. At the first stage, the initial running route and scheduling were determined according to all reservation demands. At the second stage, the running route and scheduling were continuously optimized based on the real-time demands. The real-time demand responsive strategy, which is built up by using quantitative batch treatment rather than immediate treatment and dynamic route updating strategy for global optimization, were designed by utilizing the submission order of real-time demands. A joint optimization model of running route and scheduling was constructed based on the quantitative batch decision points in the time-dependent road network together with combination of the actual road network. In this model, the minimum total system cost was used, which is composed of the vehicle running costs and passengers' traveling time costs with constraints including vehicle capacity, passengers' time window, and vehicle running time. A solving algorithm based on the adaptive genetic algorithm was designed by considering the characteristics of the joint optimization model.

TGA-DTG experiments coupled with mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography have been applied to investigate the mass loss behaviour during ceramization and to receive information on the nature of the escaping gas species. Solid-state B-11, C-13 and Si-29 NMR spectroscopy has been applied to probe the local environment of all NMR active nuclei in the precursor, the thermolysis intermediates and the ceramic residue. IR spectroscopy has been performed to receive valuable information on the chemical bonding in all materials. The results contributed (i) to gain structural information on the decomposition process of amorphous SiBCN ceramics during the pyrolytic conversion of processable BmPSs and (ii) to optimize the pyrolytic conversion of BmPSs into SiBCN materials endowed with designed performance properties that surpass those of existing materials. Ceramic conversion starts by the release of methylamine under ammonia atmosphere via transamination and disappearance of BC3 units with the concomitant increased portion of BC3-xNx (0 < x < 3) units in the low temperature regime of the decomposition (RT-200 degrees C). It is followed by evolution of hydrocarbons due to the cleavage of bonds and formation of radicals that abstract hydrogen. In the high temperature regime of the decomposition, hydrogen is removed due to dehydrocoupling reactions. After heating to 700 degrees C, BN3, BCN2, and SiN4 domains as well as Si-C-N units of mixed compositions coexist. Further heating to 1000 degrees C results in a continuous transformation into an amorphous SiBCN network consisting of B(C)N domains, SiCxN4-x units with x = 0, 1, 2 and free carbon.

Expanding on past work on Lyapunov theory and matrix inequalities, criteria are derived for designing two-step observer-based dynamic output feedback controllers for discrete-time DNLDIs.

Machine Learning Inspired Phishing Detection (PD for Efficient Classification and Secure Storage Distribution (SSD) for Cloud-IoT Application	2020 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)					IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	DEC 01-04, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc				Cloud-IoT data security and privacy have become a major problem due to its sensitivity, which curbs multiple cloud applications. In addition, if the encrypted data lives in one place, in many fields, such as the financial industry and government agencies, the man-in-the-middle-attack (MMA) and phishing attack (PA) may have chances of realising the extraction. The phishing goal is evaluated and predicted by most previous machine learning models through a discrete or continuous result. The current models lag in accurately determining both attacks because of this approach. We developed a three-step phishing detection (PD) framework inspired by machine learning and a secure storage distribution (SSD) for cloud to improve model accuracy and storage security. The partition-based selection of features is designed for phishing detection (PD) with a hybrid classifier approach and hyper-parameter classifier tuning. Initially, the entire data set is partitioned by entropy and is hybridised for each performing model partition. In order to reduce the complexity, the next entropy is applied to decrease the dimension of each partition. Finally, to improve precision, the performing model is optimised with hyper-parameter tuning. The partition-based feature choice with the hybrid classifier approach outperforms with 97.86% accuracy for both attack detection from the experimental and comparative results of SVM, LM, NN and RF. Atlast, SSD performance is evaluated against other storage models where SSD outperforms other models.

An adaptive fuzzy predictive control of nonlinear processes based on Multi-Kernel least squares support vector regression	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												In this paper, an adaptive fuzzy Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) is proposed for discrete-time nonlinear systems via Takagi-Sugeno system based Multi-Kernel Least Squares Support Vector Regression (TS-LSSVR). The proposed adaptive TS-LSSVR strategy is constructed using a multi-kernel least squares support vector regression where the learning procedure of the proposed TS-LSSVR is achieved in three steps: In the first step, which is an offline step, the antecedent parameters of the TS-LSSVR are initialized using a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. The second step, which is an online step, deals with the adaptation of the antecedent parameters which can be implemented using a back-propagation algorithm. Finally, the last online step is to use the Fixed-Budget Kernel Recursive Least Squares algorithm to obtain the consequent parameters. Furthermore, an adaptive generalized predictive control for nonlinear systems is introduced by integrating the proposed adaptive TS-LSSVR into the generalized predictive controller (GPC). The reliability of the proposed adaptive TS-LSSVR GPC controller is investigated by controlling two nonlinear systems: A surge tank and continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) systems. The proposed TS-LSSVR GPC controller has demonstrated good results and efficiently controlled the nonlinear plants. Furthermore, the adaptive TS-LSSVR GPC has the ability to deal with disturbances and variations in the nonlinear systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This electrolyte can withstand high potential, allowing the operation of a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NMC-811) cathode. One-dimensional carbon nanotubes, two-dimensional graphene nanosheets, and three-dimensional ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-8 are used as the host materials for the accommodation of Li metal. The strong and continuous conducting network of CMK-8 with interpenetrating open channels is found to be a promising scaffold for Li metal. With the proposed electrolyte, the CMK-8 electrode enables uniform Li plating/stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% under a practical current density of 1 mA cm(-2). Moreover, a long life of >550 charge-discharge cycles is achieved. The high structural stability of CMK-8 upon cycling is confirmed using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Finally, we use a Li-free CMK-8 electrode, an NMC-811 cathode, and the proposed electrolyte to construct a full cell. The electrochemical properties are evaluated. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

By fully taking into account the variations of Lyapunov function at the switching instants and non-switching intervals, sufficient conditions are developed to ensure the o-error mean-square stability for networked semi-Markov jump systems.

Literature from stated preference surveys find that attitudes and current travel behavior are as or more important than demographics in determining intention to purchase or use AVs. Yet to date no study has looked at how attitudes and use of existing modes both simultaneously affect AV adoption. In this study, we conduct a stated preference survey in Singapore to investigate how the subjective evaluation of existing travel modes (attitudes) and inertia based on previous use of existing modes affect the adoption of an autonomous mobility-ondemand service (AMOD). Using a sample size of 2,003 individuals and 11,613 choice observations, we estimate a mixed logit discrete choice model incorporating latent variables capturing subjective evaluations of existing travel modes (determined through confirmatory factor analysis), a two-part formulation of modal inertia, and other trip-specific and socio-demographic variables. Results show that subjective evaluation and use of existing modes both affect the adoption of AMOD. Specifically, people with a positive evaluation of ridehailing and those who are current ridehailing users are more likely to choose AMOD. Additionally, those who are current car drivers are more likely to choose AMOD, while users of public transit were less likely to choose AMOD. Given that ridehailing is the closest existing mode to our hypothetical AMOD service, our results might suggest that how AVs are implemented and their similarity to existing modes may be critical to the formation of attitudes and direction of inertia impacting adoption. Our research provides insights on the potential relationship between AVs and existing modes that could valuable in AV network design and service planning.

J	Nashawi, IS; Malallah, A				Nashawi, Ibrahim Sami; Malallah, Adel			Improved Electrofacies Characterization and Permeability Predictions in Sandstone Reservoirs Using a Data Mining and Expert System Approach	PETROPHYSICS												Permeability is one of the most important parameters in reservoir characterization. It plays a major role in reservoir simulation, enhanced oil recovery, well completion design, and overall field exploitation and development strategies. Yet, despite its vital importance, it is one of the most difficult and controversial petrophysical properties to calculate accurately. Permeability is commonly determined from transient well test analyses; however, well tests yield an average permeability value for the entire drainage area of the well. Core analysis provides the best fine-scale permeability measurements; nevertheless, coring operations are very costly and impractical to perform in all wells. Conversely, well-log responses are widely available; when properly analyzed, wireline logs have the advantage of providing continuous permeability traces as opposed to scanty, discrete core data. The proposed approach combines data mining and expert systems to accurately predict the formation permeability from wireline well logs. It involves a two-step procedure. First, principal components analysis, cluster analysis, and classification-tree analysis are coherently used to identify and characterize electrofacies types; then, the fuzzy-logic model is applied to each electrofacies to determine the formation permeability within the specified interval. Actual field data obtained from a reservoir in the Middle East are used to illustrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results are cross-examined with geologic data to ensure that the predictions are consistent with the well-log responses and rock properties.																			1529-9074					JUN	2009	50	3					250	268																WOS:000266318400006

First, a modified prescribed performance control mechanism based on a hyperbolic cosecant performance function is proposed to specify the transient behavior of tracking errors with an arbitrarily small overshoot. Then, to eliminate the lumped disturbances with a better identification property, a novel echo state network approximator that uses the estimation error to learn neural weights is designed with the aid of a minimal learning parameter technique, which not only can exclude the poor transient behaviors occurring extensively in the existing neural control with a large adaptive gain, but also dramatically reduce the number of parameters to be updated online. Furthermore, contrasting to the available tracking results assuming a continuous control updating, a hysteresis quantizer is introduced to provide discrete values of control signals, supporting the use of digital devices in MEMS gyroscope implementations to realize a closed-loop error stabilization. Finally, ultimately uniformly bounded stability of closed-loop system is proved with the aid of Lyapunov function and nonsmooth analysis technique, while not only simulations but also experimental results are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.						zhang, wendong/0000-0003-1762-9246; Cao, Huiliang/0000-0001-9862-4329													0278-0046	1557-9948				OCT	2021	68	10					9972	9983		10.1109/TIE.2020.3026297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2020.3026297													WOS:000670541800086

The involved time delays are assumed to be randomly time-varying and are modeled by introducing Bernoulli distributed sequences. By using a piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional together with the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, we design a delay-distributed dependent state estimator such that the estimation error system is globally exponentially stable. Further, a class of switching signals specified by the average dwell time is identified to guarantee the exponential state estimation. All the conditions are established in the framework of LMIs, which can easily be solved by using standard numerical software.

In the proposed system, each RIS not only enhances the primary transmission from the primary transmitter (PT) to the associated primary receiver (PR) nearby, but also acts as an Internet-of-Things (IoT) device to enable IoT transmissions to the same PR. Therefore, each PR needs to jointly decode the information from both the PT and its corresponding RIS. We are interested in maximizing the weighted sum-rate of both primary and IoT transmissions by jointly designing the active transmit beamforming at PT and the passive beamforming at each RIS under the maximum transmit power constraint at the PT and various constraints on the reflection coefficients (RCs), which include the ideal, continuous-phase and the discrete-phase cases. The formulated problem is non-convex, which cannot be solved directly. Thus, fractional programming (FP) method and alternating optimization (AO) technique are adopted to tackle the problem. In particular, three low-complexity algorithms are proposed to trade off between computational complexity and convergence rate. Compared to different benchmark schemes, simulation results demonstrate that with the aid of the RISs, the PRs can benefit from the enhanced primary transmission from the PT, and receive information from the associated RISs via IoT transmission.

With the progression of wired and wireless technologies both m-healthcare and e-healthcare turn into an essential fragment of biomedical science. Mixing of EEG signal with some other biological signal is referred as artifacts. Removal of artifacts postures an abundant challenge in the medical field. In this paper, Hybrid multi resolution discrete wavelet transform based delayed error normalized least mean square is proposed to eradicate motion artifact from the recorded EEG signal. After filtering process Encryption and Encoding take place with chaos encryption and Turbo encoder. Encryption is the process of scrambling the plain EEG signal in to Chipper format. Telemedicine system can be used to transmit medical data transmission and it requires an optimal channel estimation method (ESSA) to reduce BERs. The main aim of ESSA algorithm is to optimally place the pilot symbols and in-order to enable the automatic estimation of state of the channel. Channel estimation is facilitated through GFDM-IM modulation approach and the estimation can be done through SVD-LMMSE module. The proposed optimal based channel estimation is simulated under Xilinx platform with Verilog coding. Then, the performance of the proposed method will be analysed in terms of BER, area and frequency.

We first show that the CP design problem should be modeled as a bilevel optimization, where the network planner designs the CP with the minimum vulnerability to physical-layer attacks (i.e., the upper-level optimization), while the attacker plans and launches attacks to disrupt the designed CP (i.e., the lower-level optimization). Then, the bilevel mode is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which can solve the CP design problem exactly. We also propose a heuristic to tackle the problem time-efficiently.

Invasive glucometers, although precise, only provide discrete measurements at specific times and are unsuitable for long-term monitoring due to the injuries caused on skin and the prohibitive cost of disposables. Remote, continuous, self-monitoring of blood sugar levels allows for active and better management of diabetics. In this work, we present a radio frequency (RF) sensor based on a stepped impedance resonator for remote blood glucose monitoring. When placed on top of a human hand, this RF interdigital sensor allows detection of variation in blood sugar levels by monitoring the changes in the dielectric constant of the material underneath. The designed stepped impedance resonator operates at 3.528 GHz with a Q factor of 1455. A microfluidic device structure that imitates the blood veins in the human hand was fabricated in PDMS to validate that the sensor can measure changes in glucose concentrations. To test the RF sensor, glucose solutions with concentrations ranging from 0 to 240 mg/dL were injected into the fluidic channels and placed underneath the RF sensor. The shifts in the resonance frequencies of the RF sensor were measured using a network analyzer via its S-11 parameters. Based on the change in resonance frequencies, the sensitivity of the biosensor was found to be 264.2 kHz/mg center dot dL(-1) and its LOD was calculated to be 29.89 mg/dL.

Optimized peptide functionalization of thiol-acrylate emulsion-templated porous polymers leads to expansion of human pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture	JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART A-POLYMER CHEMISTRY												Highly porous polymers produced by polymerization of the continuous phase of a high internal phase emulsion have been developed as scaffolds for 3D culture of human pluripotent stem cells. These emulsion-templated polymerized high internal phase emulsion (polyHIPE) materials have an interconnected network of pores that provide support for the cells, while also allowing both cell ingress and nutrient diffusion. Thiol-acrylate polyHIPE materials were prepared by photopolymerization, which, due to a competing acrylate homopolymerization process, leads to a material with residual surface thiols. These thiols were then used as a handle to allow postpolymerization functionalization with both maleimide and a maleimide-derivatized cyclo-RGDfK peptide, via Michael addition under benign conditions. Functionalization was evaluated using an Ellman's colorimetric assay, to monitor the residual thiol concentration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Maleimide was used as a model molecule to optimize conditions prior to peptide-functionalization. The use of triethylamine as a catalyst and a mixed ethanol-aqueous solvent system led to optimized reaction between surface-bound thiols and maleimide. Peptide-functionalized materials showed improved attachment and infiltration of human pluripotent stem cells over 7 days, demonstrating their promise as a scaffold for 3D stem cell culture and expansion.

Active control of a rod-net formwork system prototype	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION												A prototype rod-net for a fabric formwork system is described, including the fabrication, control of the geometry via turnbuckles, and the measurement of nodal coordinates via an image-based theodolite system. Such a net and fabric formwork system consists of a network of tie elements, either discrete or continuous, forming the main falsework structure, onto which is placed a fabric membrane acting as the flexible formwork for the pouring of wet concrete for the forming of a concrete shell. The fabrication of the plastic and steel net components of the prototype is described in detail, including the arrangement of the nodes, rods and boundary conditions. A control system was developed to determine the necessary adjustments at the boundary elements to move the rod-net to a target geometry to eliminate deviations that may arise from fabrication and construction tolerances. This control system showed that with minimal adjustments the rod-net could be directed effectively, resulting in deviations from the target surface reduced from up to 3-9 mm to below 1-2 mm for a 3D rod-net of approximate dimension 2.5 m x 4.5 m x 2.0 m. Additionally, the algorithm provided a more symmetric distribution of deviations around the target. The control system was coupled with 3D point-cloud measurements of markers placed on and around the rod-net by using a motorised image-assisted theodolite and specialised software for spherical and circular targets. This semi-automated process proved to be both efficient and accurate for determining the spatial co-ordinates of the markers and hence the node locations.

Long-Term Impacts on Groundwater and Reductive Dechlorination Following Bioremediation in a Highly Characterized Trichloroethene DNAPL Source Area	GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION												High-resolution soil and groundwater monitoring was performed to assess the long-term impacts of bioremediation using bioaugmentation with a dechlorinating microbial consortium (and sodium lactate as the electron donor) in a well-characterized trichloroethene (TCE) dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source area. Monitoring was performed up to 3.7 years following active bioremediation using a high-density monitoring network that included several discrete interval multi-level sampling wells. Results showed that despite the absence of lactate, lactate fermentation transformation products, or hydrogen, biogeochemical conditions remained favorable for the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes. In locations where soil data showed that TCE DNAPL sources persisted, local contaminant rebound was observed in groundwater, whereas no rebound or continuous decreases in chlorinated ethenes were observed in locations where DNAPL sources were treated. While ethene levels measured 3.7 years after active treatment suggested relatively low (2 to 30%) dechlorination of the parent TCE and daughter products, carbon stable isotope analysis showed that the extent of complete dechlorination was much greater than indicated by ethene generation and that the estimated first-order rate constant describing the complete dechlorination of TCE at 3.7 years following active bioremediation was approximately 3.6 y1. Overall, results of this study suggest that biological processes may persist to treat TCE for years after cessation of active bioremediation, thereby serving as an important component of remedial treatment design and long-term attenuation.

Inverse estimation of number and location of discrete heaters in radiant furnaces using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER												The inverse problem of the determination of optimum number and location of discrete heaters in a three dimensional radiant heating furnace is solved by developing an artificial neural network based model to replace the radiative transfer equation solver and coupling it with genetic algorithm. The furnace medium is considered to be participating with a mixture of H2O and CO2. For the purpose of estimation of the best configuration of the heaters to achieve a desired uniform heat flux at the design surface, the inverse problem has been treated as an optimization problem. A generalized radiative transfer code based on Finite Volume Method and spectral line based weighted sum of gray gases method has been developed and validated with the available benchmarks. This code serves as the basis to develop the neural network based model for the flux estimation at design surface. The ANN function has been tested upon 5 random test cases. The ANN based replacement of RTE for this problem gives an error less than 4% for the local heat flux values at the order of 10(3) times less computation time. A design case is then considered where the desired flux levels should be uniform on the design surface in a very tight tolerance. Results obtained show that this novel method of ANN coupled with GA proves to be a fast, robust and efficient tool for solving such types of inverse problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Beamspace MIMO for Millimeter-Wave Communications: System Architecture, Modeling, Analysis, and Measurements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION												Millimeter-wave wireless systems are emerging as a promising technology for meeting the exploding capacity requirements of wireless communication networks. Besides large bandwidths, small wavelengths at mm-wave lead to a high-dimensional spatial signal space, that can be exploited for significant capacity gains through high-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. In conventional MIMO approaches, optimal performance requires prohibitively high transceiver complexity. By combining the concept of beamspace MIMO communication with a hybrid analog-digital transceiver, continuous aperture phased (CAP) MIMO achieves near-optimal performance with dramatically lower complexity. This paper presents a framework for physically-accurate computational modeling and analysis of CAP-MIMO, and reports measurement results on a DLA-based prototype for multimode line-of-sight communication. The model, based on a critically sampled system representation, is used to demonstrate the performance gains of CAP-MIMO over state-of-the-art designs at mm-wave. For example, a CAP-MIMO system can achieve a spectral efficiency of 10-20 bits/s/Hz with a 17-31 dB power advantage over state-of-the-art, corresponding to a data rate of 10-200 Gbps with 1-10 GHz system bandwidth. The model is refined to analyze critical sources of power loss in an actual multimode system. The prototype-based measurement results closely follow the theoretical predictions, validating CAP-MIMO theory, and illustrating the utility of the model.																			0018-926X	1558-2221				JUL	2013	61	7					3814	3827		10.1109/TAP.2013.2254442	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2254442													WOS:000321670900046

However, the existing studies on MPs do not explain the assortative or disassortative tendencies of STNs due to their omission of the support of the sociological theory, as well as that of network theory. To address this issue, this study investigates the MPs in STNs from the standpoint of social identity theory (SIT). The user trust networks (UTNs) are modeled by a directed multigraph (DMG). Then, the structural properties of homogeneous trust networks and heterogeneous trust networks are explored via measures that include degree centrality, the correlation coefficient (CC), the cumulative distribution of the ratio of trust degree to distrust degree (CDRTD), and the assortativity coefficient. The MPs of homogeneous trust networks and heterogeneous trust networks are explained from the perspective of SIT. An experiential evaluation is conducted in the constructed homogeneous trust networks and heterogeneous trust networks using a real-world data set crawled from Epinions. The research findings indicate that the MPs in homogeneous trust networks tend toward assortative mixing (AM), and those in heterogeneous trust networks tend toward disassortative mixing (DM). The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed approach is superior to that of the state-of-the-art approach to influential user identification.					zhou, you/KBC-3567-2024; wang, xueting/JPY-2782-2023; Wang, Shuihua/G-7326-2016; FANG, XW/JAO-3428-2023; Zhang, Yudong/I-7633-2013	Zhang, Yudong/0000-0002-4870-1493													2329-924X					OCT	2021	8	5					1249	1261		10.1109/TCSS.2020.3021179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSS.2020.3021179													WOS:000702557700022

Such set arises as a relaxation of feasible sets of general mixed integer problems such as lot-sizing and network design problems. We derive several families of valid inequalities that, in particular, generalize the arc residual capacity inequalities and the flow cover inequalities. For the constant capacitated case we provide an extended compact formulation and give a partial description of the convex hull in the original space which is exact under a certain condition. By lifting some basic inequalities we provide some insight on the difficulty of obtaining such a full polyhedral description for the constant capacitated case.

The GRAFCET is then used to model the individual functional modules and the hierarchical behavior of the system. The behavior of each module is represented as a sequential-concurrent hybrid discrete event system.

Finally, these embedded hardware controllers are generated automatically to integrate all intelligent functional modules into a complex embedded system, and a hardware circuit is then synthesized. The experimental results show that the hardware circuit can meet the definition of an SSN system for Industrial Internet of Things applications. Moreover, this methodology enables a coherent design quality, short design period, low development cost, and short time-to-market for complex industrial applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Guo, JJ; Zhang, YN				Guo, Jinjin; Zhang, Yunong			Stepsize Interval Confirmation of General Four-Step DTZN Algorithm Illustrated With Future Quadratic Programming and Tracking Control of Manipulators	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS												Future quadratic programming (FQP) is an interesting and challenging topic due to its unknown future information and time-dependent feature. In this paper, a continuous-time zeroing neurodynamics (CTZN) model for quadratic programming is first obtained via zeroing neurodynamics (ZN) method. Then, a general four-step Zhang et al. discretization formula is presented and adopted to discretize the above CTZN model, and thus the general four-step discrete-time ZN (DTZN) algorithm for the FQP is developed. For comparison, a three-step DTZN algorithm and a one-step DTZN algorithm for the FQP are also presented. It is worth noting that there is an important parameter termed stepsize in the DTZN algorithms, which is closely related to their stability. If the value of stepsize is outside its effective interval, the DTZN algorithms are impossible to achieve convergence in terms of residual errors, which leads to failure of the FQP problem solving. By utilizing bilinear transformation and Routh stability criterion, the effective stepsize interval of the general four-step DTZN algorithm is confirmed via theoretical proof. Besides, numerical results substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the general four-step DTZN algorithm as well as the accuracy of the effective stepsize interval. Finally, the general four-step DTZN algorithm is applied to fulfill the path-tracking control of different robot manipulators, with the effectiveness and superiority further validated.

In this regard, retailers need to consider the competition risks of competitors in addition to the disruption risks. This paper designs a resilient retail supply chain network for perishable foods under the dynamic competition to maximize retailer's profits.Design/methodology/approachA two-stage mixed-integer non-linear model is presented for designing the supply chain network. In the first stage, an equilibrium model that considers the characteristics of perishable foods is developed. In the second stage, a mixed integer non-linear programming model is presented to deal with the strategic decisions. Finally, an efficient memetic algorithm is designed to deal with large-scale problems.FindingsThe optimal the selection of suppliers, distribution centers and the order allocation are found among the supply chain entities. Considering the perishability of agri-food products, the equilibrium retail price and selling quantity are determined. Through a numerical example, the optimal inventory period under different maximum shelf life and the impact of three resilient strategies on retailer's profit, selling price and selling quantity are analyzed.Research limitations/implicationsAs for future research, the research can be extended in a number of directions. First, this paper studies the retail supply chain network design problem under competition among retailers. It can be an interesting direction to consider retailers competing with suppliers. Second, the authors can try to linearize the non-linear model and solve the large-scale integer programming problem by exact algorithm. Finally, the freshness of perishable foods gradually declines linearly to zero as the maximum shelf life approaches, and it would be a meaningful attempt to consider the freshness of perishable foods declines exponentially.Originality/valueThis paper innovatively designs the resilient supply chain network for perishable foods under dynamic competition. The retailer's dynamic competition and resilient strategies are considered simultaneously when designing supply chain network for perishable foods. In addition, this paper gives insights into how to obtain the optimal inventory period and compare the retailer's resilient strategies.																			0007-070X	1758-4108				JAN 8	2024	126	2					662	681		10.1108/BFJ-12-2022-1135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BFJ-12-2022-1135		OCT 2023											WOS:001078995100001

Traditionally, power system planning projects have considered minimizing the costs of capacity expansion and minimizing the amount of energy not served as the main objectives. With climate change policies enforcing the decommissioning of fossil-fuel-based generation, new clean and renewable generation technologies are being considered for power system capacity expansion projects. However, the environmental impacts of energy resources are not limited to carbon emissions and their contribution to global warming. In fact, every power generation technology can result in undesired impacts during its entire life cycle, which could negatively affect air quality, water resources, material resources, and/or human health. This paper provides an overview of how to assess the sustainability of power systems and power generation technologies based on life cycle assessment (LCA). A review of LCA, as applied to power systems and generation technologies, is presented with a discussion of general findings, challenges, and limitations. A review of the literature is then provided related to how sustainability objectives are currently incorporated in power grid design and capacity expansion models. Finally, shortcomings of the current models are discussed, along with opportunities for future research.

The development of new chemical routes and of innovative modular technologies may lead to some breakthrough progress. Some successful stories have been nowadays demonstrated. Particularly, batch-to-continuous is one of the key issues for intensifying processes. But, the need of process intensification requires the need of collecting many new data of high quality relative to the chemical reaction and to the equipment as well, which represents sometimes a huge effort. This discussion is the opportunity to review the basic data and the metrology associated for the characterization of applications and technologies in order to guide the design of the intensified process. Concerning the chemicals, the stoechio-kinetics parameters, the phase equilibria data (for instance solubility) or the reaction enthalpies can be efficiently determined thanks to microfluidic devices. Concerning the equipment, benchmark studies have to be performed in view of comparing the technologies according to pressure drop, residence time distribution, heat and mass transfer performances, mixing efficiencies and so on. A way of capitalizing the background knowledge lies on simulation tools development, here called data processing tool. This presentation intends also to introduce some of the European network tools developed for diffusing the methodology of intensification, like the industrial club EUROPIC (European Process Intensification Centre) and the demonstration platform MEPI (Maison Europeenne des Procedes Innovants).

J	Grammig, J; Hujer, R; Scheidler, M				Grammig, J; Hujer, R; Scheidler, M			Discrete choice modelling in airline network management	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS												The task of airline network management is to develop new flight schedule variants and evaluate them in terms of expected passenger demand and revenue. Given the industry's trend towards global cooperation, this is especially important when evaluating the potential synergies with alliance partners. From the econometric point of view, this task represents a discrete choice modelling problem in which one has to account for a large number of dependent alternatives. In this paper we discuss the applicability of recently proposed approaches and introduce a new multinomial probit specification designed for the airline network management task. The superior performance of the new model is demonstrated in a real-world application using airline bookings data.

The workability of concrete involves early stage operations of concrete: placing, compaction, and finishing. Since RMC is manufactured at a plant and transported to the construction site, loss of workability is of prime concern due to the considerable time interval between mixing and placing of concrete. Workability of concrete is measured using a slump test to evaluate the life of the concrete during its transportation phase and the uniformity of the concrete from batch to batch. The proportions of cement, fly ash, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, water, and admixtures in the concrete govern its workability or slump value. In this study, an Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) learning from past examples gathered from a RMC plant were used to model the functional relationship between the input parameters and the slump value of concrete. The ANN model provided promising results compared to first-order and second-order regression techniques for modeling the unknown and complex relationships exhibited by the design mix proportions and the slump of concrete. The neural network synaptic weights that control the learning mechanism of ANN were further used to compute the percentage of relative importance of each constituent of RMC on the slump value, providing insight into the composite nature of concrete. The technique presented in the study will enable technical staff to quickly estimate the slump of RMC based on its design mix constituents without having to perform multiple design mix trials in order to achieve a customized slump value.

Considering the MIMO networked control system with multiple sensor nodes, the deadband scheduling strategy with multi-threshold is employed, then the transmit character of the sensor node's data packets is analyzed. To compensate the effect of the deadband and network-induced delay, an observer is employed, and the closed loop system with the observer and dynamic feed back controller is modeled as a discrete time linear system with uncertainty. Then by the Lyapunov function and LMIs method, the sufficient condition for asymptotic stability is presented, together with the design method for the dynamic feedback controller and observer. Finally, a numerical example is given to validate the method.

A parallel network simulation and virtual time-based network emulation testbed	JOURNAL OF SIMULATION												To analyse large-scale systems with high fidelity, it is necessary for a network testbed to offer both realistic emulation (to represent software execution) and effective simulation (to model background computation and communication). We present a network testbed that integrates a lightweight emulation system (modified earlier to operate in virtual time) with a parallel discrete event network simulator. Our contributions lie in the design of a global synchronization algorithm to manage virtual time as it transitions from emulation to simulation, and back. In particular, we optimize our previous algorithm to reduce overhead of synchronizations across simulation and emulation. We also address the unavoidable uncertainties introduced by the emulation by obtaining analytical bounds for the error, and produce empirical data showing that the error is as small as the minimum system execution unit. In addition, we observe excellent system scalability with large-scale network experiments, and demonstrate the performance improvement of the optimized global synchronization algorithm.																			1747-7778	1747-7786				AUG	2014	8	3					206	214		10.1057/jos.2013.29	http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/jos.2013.29													WOS:000339772200003

Holistic Affect Recognition Using PaNDA: Paralinguistic Non-Metric Dimensional Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING												Humans perceive emotion from each other using a holistic perspective, accounting for diverse personal, non-emotional variables, such as age and personality, that shape expression. In contrast, today's algorithms are mainly designed to recognize emotion in isolation, and are usually demonstrated only within one relatively narrow database. In this article, we propose a multi-task learning approach to jointly learn the recognition of affective states from speech along with various speaker attributes. A problem with multi-task learning is that sometimes inductive transfer can negatively impact performance. To mitigate negative transfer, we introduce the Paralinguistic Non-metric Dimensional Analysis (PaNDA) method that systematically measures task relatedness and also enables visualizing the topology of affective phenomena as a whole. In addition, we present a generic framework that conflates the concepts of single-task and multi-task learning. Using this framework, we construct two models that demonstrate holistic affect recognition: one treats all tasks as equally related, whereas the other one incorporates the task correlations between a main task and its supporting tasks obtained from PaNDA. Both models employ a multi-task deep neural network, in which separate output layers are used to predict discrete and continuous attributes, while hidden layers are shared across different tasks. On average across 18 classification and regression tasks, the weighted multi-task learning with PaNDA significantly improves performance compared to single-task and unweighted multi-task learning.

Marshal			Observer-based control for switched networked control systems with missing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS												This paper addresses the issue of observer-based control problem for a class of switched networked control systems (NCSs). In particular, by considering the packet loss and time delay in the network, a discrete-time switched system is formulated. Moreover, the packet loss in the network is assumed to occur in a random way, which is described by introducing Bernoulli distributed white sequences. First, results for the exponential stabilization of discrete-time switched NCSs without random packet loss is derived by using the average dwell time approach and multiple Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Next, the attention is focused on designing an observer-based state feedback controller for NCSs with random packet loss which ensures that the resulting error system is exponentially stable. Further, the sufficient conditions for existence of control parameters are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved by using some standard numerical packages. Also, the observer and control gains can be calculated by using the solutions of a set of LMIs. Finally, a numerical example based on DC motor model is provided to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design procedure.

J	Shen, YN; Gwak, H; Han, BM				Shen, Yingnan; Gwak, Hogyeong; Han, Bumsoo			Advanced manufacturing of nanoparticle formulations of drugs and biologics using microfluidics	ANALYST												Numerous innovative nanoparticle formulations of drugs and biologics, named nano-formulations, have been developed in the last two decades. However, methods for their scaled-up production are still lagging, as the amount needed for large animal tests and clinical trials is typically orders of magnitude larger. This manufacturing challenge poses a critical barrier to successfully translating various nano-formulations. This review focuses on how microfluidics technology has become a powerful tool to overcome this challenge by synthesizing various nano-formulations with improved particle properties and product purity in large quantities. This microfluidic-based manufacturing is enabled by microfluidic mixing, which is capable of the precise and continuous control of the synthesis of nano-formulations. We further discuss the specific applications of hydrodynamic flow focusing, a staggered herringbone micromixer, a T-junction mixer, a micro-droplet generator, and a glass capillary on various types of nano-formulations of polymeric, lipid, inorganic, and nanocrystals. Various separation and purification microfluidic methods to enhance the product purity are reviewed, including acoustofluidics, hydrodynamics, and dielectrophoresis. We further discuss the challenges of microfluidics being used by broader research and industrial communities. We also provide future outlooks of its enormous potential as a decentralized approach for manufacturing nano-formulations. Scaled-up production of nano-formulations is challenging. Find out how microfluidic manufacturing simultaneously meets the requirements for quality and throughput.

The composition of PBR/PP blends (30/70 and 40/60) was designed in a way to study the interrelationship between the compatibilizer content and blend composition. In this study, a hydrocarbon resin (MS 40) was employed as the compatibilizer. Based on morphological analysis, the addition of compatibilizer in both blend compositions led to a finer and more uniform distribution of rubber domains; however, only for 40/60 composition, the higher content of compatibilizer caused the formation of a co-continuous morphology. Both dynamic and static rheology results were highly susceptible to the compatibilizer content and blend composition. According to the storage and loss modulus curves, the incorporation of PBR into PP resulted in a significantly enhanced elastic response with 30/70 composition showing lower elasticity. The viscosity upturn in complex viscosity curves indicated the formation of a three-dimensional network of dispersed rubber domains within the matrix, which led to the appearance of a highly elastic response. Based on the dynamic mechanical analysis, the highly restricted macromolecular motions upon the addition of a compatibilizer confirmed the enhanced compatibility of TPVs.																			1083-5601	1548-0585				FEB	2022	28	1					50	61		10.1002/vnl.21819	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vnl.21819		OCT 2021											WOS:000712351800001

However, few research studies have looked at how the social capital of social networking sites (SNSs) is related to the social identity of its members. Drawing on social capital and social identity theory, this study investigated the effects of SNS social capital (shared language, social trust and network density) on social identity and continuous participation. The mediating role of social identity was also investigated. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 444 SNS members volunteered to participate in this study. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze a conceptual model. Findings - The results revealed that SNS social trust and network density directly and significantly affected the social identity and continuous participation behavior of members. SNSs using a shared language positively affected social identity, but this was not directly associated with continuous participation behavior. Originality/value - Because the network externalities of SNSs exert critical effects on user benefits, attracting continuous user participation remains one of the critical challenges for SNS administrators. Both the theoretical and practical implications of this study can aid SNS administrators in developing effective continuous participation strategies.

The dynamic behavior of traffic signals is a discrete model and is one of the most important and effective methods of controlling traffic at intersections. In this paper, Petri nets are applied to model a network of intersections and the formal proof is based on the sequent calculus of Linear Logic. The approach can prove that unsafe states are not reached, and that desirable states are reached. This is done using the equivalence between Petri nets reachability and the proof of a set of sequents in Linear Logic. The approach is illustrated by an example of a network of intersections controlled by traffic signals.																			1746-4498		978-1-84564-087-3				2007	96						289	297		10.2495/UT070281	http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/UT070281													WOS:000257236400028

With this in perspective, it is expedient to explicitly model the SC network to synchronize activities across the cooperating partners. This research is concerned with the performance behaviour of two different SC network structures given different design and control parameters adopted by the partnering echelons within the assumed SC configurations. Accordingly, the authors developed discrete event simulation models of two hypothetical supply chain structures and exploit the Taguchi experimental design procedure as a vehicle for conducting the simulation experiments and analyzing its outcome. The results highlight the relative effects of the assumed design and controlling factors on system-wide SC performance and identify appropriate combinations of these factors for optimal performance concerned. For the average inventory level performance measure, key results reveal that sharing of demand information between partnering echelons should not automatically be taken for granted as a direction for performance enhancement.																			1935-5726	1935-5734				JUL-SEP	2013	6	3					63	85		10.4018/ijisscm.2013070103	http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/ijisscm.2013070103													WOS:000214457000003

J	Tiño, P; Schittenkopf, C; Dorffner, G				Tiño, P; Schittenkopf, C; Dorffner, G			Volatility trading via temporal pattern recognition in quantised financial time series	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS												We investigate the potential of the analysis of noisy non-stationary time series by quantising it into streams of discrete symbols and applying finite-memory symbolic predictors. Careful quantisation can reduce the noise in the time series to make model estimation more amenable, We apply the quantisation strategy in a realistic setting involving financial forecasting and trading, In particular, using historical data, we simulate the trading of straddles on the financial indexes DAX and FTSE 100 on a daily basis, based on predictions of the daily volatility differences in the underlying indexes. We propose a parametric, data-driven quantisation scheme which transforms temporal patterns in the series of daily volatility changes into grammatical and statistical patterns in the corresponding symbolic streams. As symbolic predictors operating on the quantised streams, we use the classical fixed-order Markov models, variable memory length Markov models and a novel variation of fractal-based predictors, introduced in its original form in Tino and Dorffner [1]. The fractal based predictors are designed to efficiently use deep memory. We compare the symbolic models with continuous techniques such as time-delay neural networks with continuous and categorical outputs, and GARCH models. Our experiments strongly suggest that the robust information reduction achieved by quantising the real-valued time series is highly beneficial. To deal with non-stationarity in financial daily time series, we propose two techniques that combine 'sophisticated' models fitted on the training data with a fixed set of simple-minded symbolic predictors not using older (and potentially misleading) data in the training set. Experimental results show that by quantising the volatility differences and then using symbolic predictive models, market makers can sometimes generate a statistically significant excess profit. We also mention some interesting observations regarding the memory structure in the series of daily volatility differences studied.

Hybrid Evolutionary Metaheuristics for Concurrent Multi-Objective Design of Urban Road and Public Transit Networks	NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS												This paper addresses a bi-modal multi-objective discrete urban road network design problem with automobile and bus flow interaction. The problem considers the concurrent urban road and bus network design in which the authorities play a major role in designing bus network topology. The road network design deals with the decision making for new street constructions, lane additions to existing streets, lane allocations for two-way streets, and the orientations and locations of one-way streets. The bus network design is performed by keeping the terminal stations of the existing bus lines unchanged and redesigning the forth and back routes of each line. Four measures, namely user benefit, the demand coverage of the bus network, the demand share of the bus mode, and the average travel generalized cost of bus passengers, are used to evaluate the network design scenarios. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model in which a modal-split/assignment model is included to depict the mode and route choice behaviors of travelers.

However, this naive implementation does not consider overlapping distributions. We propose Mixed Membership Generative Adversarial Networks (MMGAN) analogous to mixed-membership models that model multiple distributions and discover their commonalities and particularities. Each data distribution is modeled as a mixture over a common set of generator distributions, and mixture weights are automatically learned from the data. Mixture weights can give insight into common and unique features of each data distribution. We evaluate our proposed MMGAN and show its effectiveness on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST with various settings.

If fragmented DES systems are aggregated to form a distributed energy storage aggregator (DESA), the DESA will have great potential to participate in the day-ahead energy and reserve market and the balancing market. The DESA could act as a mediator between the market and DES consumers, enabling beneficial coordination for DES owners and power systems. This paper presents a bilevel optimization model for DESAs in the energy and reserve market under wind power uncertainties. In the lower-level problem, generating companies, wind power plants (WPP), and DESAs are optimized for scheduling day-ahead (DA) energy and the reserve market. In the upper-level problem, operational strategies for DES systems and DESAs are designed to deal with wind power uncertainties in the balancing market. The DESA splits its resources between the energy and reserve markets so that it can reduce total power system consumption, and mutual profit for the system and end customers is achieved. This model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) program, which can be solved with commercial software. The validity of the bilevel optimization model is verified by the eight-node test transmission system and IEEE-33 bus distribution system.

A new procedure for simultaneous selection of the type (gas engine, diesel, gas turbine) and number of available prime movers (PMs) in a market, selecting PMs partial load, selecting the heating capacity of backup boiler as well as selecting the cooling capacity of electrical and absorption chillers available in the market are presented. A genetic algorithm (GA) with discrete and continuous decision variables is applied to select the equipment for the CCHP system by maximizing the actual annual benefit (AAB) as the objective function. The optimization problem is carried out for 1000 alternative states for electricity, cooling, and heating (E-Q-H) loads in the range of 500 kW to 5000 kW to investigate the effect of E-Q-H loads. Moreover, the optimization is performed at two SELL and NO-SELL modes. In the former case is the sale of the excess electricity to the network is allowed and in the latter one, it was not allowed to sell the excess electricity to the grid. A correlation in terms of E-Q-H loads is obtained to specify the effect of E-Q-H loads on optimum AAB values in SELL and NO-SELL modes. Using these correlations, designers can predict the maximum accessible AAB for any electricity, cooling, and heating loads in the above specified range.

J	Obeed, M; Chaaban, A				Obeed, Mohanad; Chaaban, Arras			Joint Beamforming Design for Multiuser MISO Downlink Aided by a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and a Relay	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have drawn considerable attention due to their ability to direct electromagnetic waves into desirable directions. Although RISs share some similarities with relays, the two have fundamental differences impacting their performance. To harness the benefits of both, we propose a downlink system wherein a relay and an RIS improve performance in terms of energy-efficiency. Using singular value decomposition (SVD), semidefinite programming (SDP), and function approximations, we propose different solutions for optimizing the beamforming matrices at the base-station (BS), the relay, and the phase shifts at the RIS to minimize the total power under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. The problem is solved when the relay operates in half-duplex and full-duplex modes and when the reflecting elements have continuous and discrete phase shifts. Simulation results compare the performance of the system with and without the RIS or the relay, under different optimization solutions. The results show that the system with full-duplex relay and RIS outperforms the other scenarios, and the contribution of full-duplex relay is higher than that of the RIS. However, an RIS outperforms a half-duplex relay when the required QoS is high. The results also show that increasing the number of reflecting elements improves the performance better in the presence of a relay than in its absence.

Conventional experimental methods for assessing these properties are time-consuming and costly. To address this challenge, advanced machine learning techniques have gained prominence in predicting bituminous mix behaviour. In this study, we focus on predicting Marshall Stability (MS) and Flow (MF) of foamed bitumen bound asphalt pavements using essential input parameters: Temperature, Foam Content, Expansion Ratio, and Half-Life. Leveraging a neural network model, accurate prediction equations and surface analyses were developed for optimizing pavement design. Furthermore, integration equations are also introduced to enhance the accuracy of the methodology. Sensitivity and Parametric Analyses provide insights into parameter impacts, and R-squared measures model goodness of fit.

But these approaches do a poor job of mimicking the real-world, and thus can only provide a distorted picture of how cognitive operations and brain development unfold outside of the lab. Here we consider future research avenues which may lead to a better appreciation of how developing brains dynamically interact with a complex real-world environment, and how cognition develops over time. We raise several problems faced by current mainstream methods in the field, before briefly reviewing novel promising approaches that alleviate some of these issues. First, we consider research that examines perception by measuring entrainment between brain activity and temporal patterns in naturalistic stimuli. Second, we consider research that examines our ability to parse our continuous experience into discrete events, and how this ability develops over time. Third, we consider the role of children as active agents in selecting what they sample from the environment from one moment to the next. Fourth, we consider new approaches that measure how mutual influences between children and others are instantiated in suprapersonal brain networks. Finally, we discuss how we may reduce adult biases when designing developmental studies. Together, these approaches have great potential to further our understanding of how the developing brain learns to process information, and to control complex real-world behaviors.																			1662-5145					JUL 13	2022	16								896919	10.3389/fnint.2022.896919	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnint.2022.896919								35910339					WOS:000832740100001

Market-driven spectrum trading is an efficient way to achieve dynamic spectrum accessing/sharing. In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum trading with single primary spectrum owner (or primary user, PO) selling his idle spectrum to multiple SUs. We model the trading process as a monopoly market, in which the PO acts as monopolist who sets the qualities and prices for the spectrum he sells, and the SUs act as consumers who choose the spectrum with appropriate quality and price for purchasing. We design a monopolist-dominated quality-price contract, which is offered by the PO and contains a set of quality-price combinations each intended for a consumer type. A contract is feasible if it is incentive compatible (IC) and individually rational (IR) for each SU to purchase the spectrum with the quality-price intended for his type. We propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for the contract to be feasible. We further derive the optimal contract, which is feasible and maximizes the utility of the PO, for both discrete-consumer-type model and continuous-consumer-type model. Moreover, we analyze the social surplus, i.e., the aggregate utility of both PO and SUs, and we find that, depending on the distribution of consumer types, the social surplus under the optimal contract may be less than or close to the maximum social surplus.

Indeed, we impose that the delivery lead time that can be promised by the company must be smaller than the lead time required by the customer.

The control design is defined as a linear quadratic regulator graphical problem, where the performance function couples the subsystems' dynamics. We first present a model-free discrete-time RL algorithm based on online behaviors without using system dynamics. This could become a prohibitively long learning process for larger networks. To remedy this issue, we develop an efficient model-free RL algorithm based on dynamic mode decomposition. This decomposition method reduces the size of the measured data while the dynamic information of the original network is still retained. This algorithm is then implemented online. The proposed methodology is validated using examples of a consensus network and a power system network.

Since the controllability and observability are the first conditions we impose in control practice, we study if a controllable/observable non-delayed system can loose those properties if we augment the model with pure input-output delays due to network control architecture. We started our approach with a classical discrete-time multi-input/output linear system with non-equal network-induced delays on command signals (inputs) and measures (outputs). We will prove that if the initial (non-delayed) system is controllable /observable, the new network-delayed system is controllable/observable despite the delay values in each input/output channel.

J	Zhou, QL				Zhou, Qiaoling			A novel movies recommendation algorithm based on reinforcement learning with DDPG policy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT COMPUTING AND CYBERNETICS												Purpose English original movies played an important role in English learning and communication. In order to find the required movies for us from a large number of English original movies and reviews, this paper proposed an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the recommendation of movies. In fact, although the conventional movies recommendation algorithms have solved the problem of information overload, they still have their limitations in the case of cold start-up and sparse data. Design/methodology/approach To solve the aforementioned problems of conventional movies recommendation algorithms, this paper proposed a recommendation algorithm based on the theory of deep reinforcement learning, which uses the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve the cold starting and sparse data problems and uses Item2vec to transform discrete action space into a continuous one. Meanwhile, a reward function combining with cosine distance and Euclidean distance is proposed to ensure that the neural network does not converge to local optimum prematurely. Findings In order to verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed algorithm, the state of the art and the proposed algorithm are compared in indexes of RMSE, recall rate and accuracy based on the MovieLens English original movie data set for the experiments. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm is superior to the conventional algorithm in various indicators. Originality/value Applying the proposed algorithm to recommend English original movies, DDPG policy produces better recommendation results and alleviates the impact of cold start and sparse data.																			1756-378X	1756-3798				MAR 9	2020	13	1					67	79		10.1108/IJICC-09-2019-0103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJICC-09-2019-0103		APR 2020											WOS:000526068600001
J	Li, BW; Wang, XB; Xin, Y; Au, ED				Li, Biwei; Wang, Xianbin; Xin, Yan; Au, Edward			Value of Service Maximization in Integrated Localization and Communication System Through Joint Resource Allocation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS												The rapid proliferation of smart devices and Internet of Things (IoT) applications have brought significantly increased demands for concurrent sensing, localization and communication services. To achieve multiple functions concurrently, new unified wireless systems including integrated localization and communication (ILAC) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are facing the fundamental challenge of integrative resource allocation among coexisting functions and services. In addressing this challenge, an ILAC system based on the efficient allocation of the common hardware and radio resource pool for localization and communication is proposed. A novel concept, termed Value of Service (VoS), is coined to maximize the unified performance of ILAC system for diverse service provisioning including localization accuracy and communication data rate. Furthermore, the bandwidth and temporal resource allocation problem is formulated for ILAC to maximize its VoS. Specifically, the problem is treated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem solved by an iterative joint resource allocation (JRA) strategy. In each iteration, the resource allocation is decomposed into two steps. Firstly, the bandwidth resource is optimized with a Kelly mechanism-based continuous allocation method followed by discretization. Secondly, the temporal resource is assigned with the aid of an adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based approach. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed VoS evaluation metric and JRA method in ILAC system under limited resources.

Groundwater salinization in arid coastal wetlands: a study case from Playa Fracasso, Patagonia, Argentina	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The origin of the high salinity in the groundwater of a coastal wetland in an arid climate was studied in the Playa Fracasso marsh, located on the northwest coast of the extra-Andean Patagonia. Research was carried out by means of the design of a network of soil pits and short piezometers in the marsh and the surrounding landforms. Continuous fluctuations of the water table, in situ physical and chemical properties, major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, SO4 (2-), HCO3 (-)) and stable isotopes (O-18 and H-2) in groundwater, as well as soil salinity, were measured. The combined analysis of the hydrodynamics, the ion ratios rCa(2+)/rCl(-) and rMg(2+)/rCa(2+) vs. rCl(-) and the isotopic composition made it possible to recognize an area within the high marsh in which the origin of groundwater is mainly marine and another in which the contributions are of mixed origin. By means of the analysis of rCl(-) vs. delta O-18, a salinization process with no change in isotopic composition was identified. Its interpretation, together with those of the soil salinity profiles and the records of the fluctuations in electrical conductivity associated with extraordinary tides, was used to define a conceptual model of salinization which could be useful to understand other coastal wetlands under similar arid climatic conditions. It consists in a cyclical mechanism of evapotranspiration, precipitation, dissolution and transport of salts during tides.

In this work, a novel blind-side rotor is designed to assemble with the stator of a laboratory-scale inline high-shear mixer equipped with an annular cylinder inside the mixing chamber (bRS HSM). The effects of operating parameters, structural parameters on the average droplet size, DSD, and span are experimentally investigated and compared with those of commercially used toothed-type rotor-stator assembly. In addition, computational fluid dynamics calculations are performed to investigate the influences on the flow field of the fluid within the HSM. The results show that the structure of the bRS HSM not only generates an optimal span but also reduces the energy consumption of the mixer, which is more advantageous for production of emulsions with narrower DSD. In the bRS HSM, Sauter mean diameter (d(32)) and span decrease with increasing rotor speed but decreasing flow rate of the continuous phase, while span decreases and then increases with increasing volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Meanwhile, the effect of structural parameters on span is nonmonotonic. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) model is used to perform the correlation of d(32) and span, providing an estimation method to optimize the operating and structural parameters of the inline HSM in the emulsification process.					li, xinyi/GWZ-8941-2022; li, xin/HHS-9461-2022; Li, xinyi/HJG-4670-2022; Huang, Yu/KDM-9182-2024; chen, yanhong/JVE-0289-2024	Zhang, Jinli/0000-0001-5805-3824; Zhao, Shuchun/0000-0002-7253-7638; Guo, Junheng/0000-0002-7117-9947													0888-5885	1520-5045				APR 6	2022	61	13					4722	4737		10.1021/acs.iecr.1c04972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c04972													WOS:000784177200020

The network coding technique proposed recently is promising for establishing multicast connections with a significantly lower bandwidth requirement than that of traditional Steiner-tree-based multicast connections. How to design multicast network topologies with the consideration of efficiently supporting multicast by the network coding technique becomes an important issue now. It is notable, however, that the conventional algorithms for network topology design are mainly unicast-oriented, and they cannot be adopted directly for the efficient topology design of network-coding-based multicast networks by simply treating each multicast as multiple unicasts. In this paper, we consider for the first time the novel topology design problem of network-coding-based multicast networks. Based on the characteristics of multicast and network coding, we first formulate this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which is NP-hard, and then propose two heuristic algorithms for it. The effectiveness of our heuristics is verified through simulation and comparison with the exhaustive search method. We demonstrate in this paper that, in the topology design of multicast networks, adopting the network coding technique to support multicast transmissions can significantly reduce the overall topology cost as compared to conventional unicast-oriented design and the Steiner-tree-based design.

J	She, CJ; Cheng, XF				She, Chen-Jun; Cheng, Xie-Feng			Design framework of hybrid ensemble identification network and its application in heart sound analysis	AIP ADVANCES												Mixed heart sounds include heart sounds in a state of resting and motion. The analysis of heart sound signals in a state of motion is a difficult problem. (1) First, the mixed heart sound signal was collected by using the shoulder-strap-type heart sound acquisition device designed and made by our research group. The acquisition scheme and data preprocessing method were given, and the characteristics of heart sound signals in a state of motion were analyzed. (2) The design framework of the Hybrid Ensemble Identification Network (HEINet) is proposed, and the design requirements, architecture principles, and detailed design steps are discussed. The design process is simple, fast, and convenient. (3) In this paper, according to the design framework of HEINet, HEINet of the mixed heart sound signal is designed, and the recognition rate of the mixed heart sound signal in biometric authentication has reached 99.1%. Based on this design framework, HEINet of the heart sound signal for the Heart Sounds Catania 2011 heart sound database and HEINet of the electrocardiogram signal for Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital arrhythmia database were designed, and the recognition rates both met the expected requirements. It shows that the design framework of HEINet has obvious universality. (c) 2022 Author(s).

This cross-country research aims to examine the impact of network externality (NE) and fear of missing out (FOMO) on the continuous use of social networks, which in turn, affects users' self-esteem. To achieve this aim, a conceptual model is developed by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) with three new factors: NE, FOMO, and self-esteem. The model is tested using a quantitative research design based on data collected through online surveys from 841 social media users in Qatar and Jordan. The data were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that the continuous use of social networks is positively affected by performance expectancy (PE), hedonic motivation (HM), and FOMO in both samples. The continuous use is also affected by effort expectancy (EE) in the Jordanian, but not the Qatari sample. In contrast, NE significantly affects the continuous use among Qatari respondents, while this relationship is not supported among their Jordanian counterparts. More interestingly, the continuous use of social networks positively impacts users' self-esteem across the two samples. In summary, this research goes beyond what was examined in the UTAUT2 by investigating the consequences of continuous use on users' self-esteem. The incorporated constructs extend the theoretical perspective of the UTAUT2 by integrating new determinants of the continuous use (i.e., FOMO and NE) and new outcomes of that use (i.e., self-esteem). The reflection of the impact of these factors in a cross-country comparison provides insights into the variation in using social networks between different countries.

This paper describes the use of simulation and statistical inference for the study of this problem. A set of projects integrated in the undergraduate course EE476, Modeling and Simulation of Computer Networks, have been designed to introduce students to the use of simulation in the study of very high speed computer networks. The extremely low cell loss ratios adopted for ATM networks tone in one million, one in one thousand million, or even less) have made obsolete the standard use of discrete event simulation in the study of ATM performance (Kessler 1993). The length of the simulation required to collect a few hundred events of cell loss would occupy a workstation several hours, even for the simplest of networks and traffic combination. This paper describes a framework for the use of discrete event simulation and statistical extrapolation for the rapid and accurate estimation of short and long term cell loss in ATM networks. The methodology is illustrated and evaluated with the estimation of the cell loss probability in the transmission of bursty voice, data, and images.																			0735-9276		1-56555-104-4				1997	29	2					21	25																WOS:000082308600004

The noise under study is novel and shown to have advantage on modeling a class of network phenomena such as random transmission delays. The optimal output feedback controller is designed using an optimal mean-square state feedback gain and two observer gains, which are determined by the mean-square stabilizing solution to a modified algebraic Riccati equation (MARE), provided that the plant is minimum-phase and left-invertible. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the stabilizing solution to the MARE is explicitly presented. It shows that the separation principle holds in a certain sense for the optimal control design of the work. The result is also applied to the optimal control problems in networked systems with random transmission delays and analog erasure channels, respectively. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

To this purpose, the implementation of an end-to-end QKD system will be discussed, including implementation aspects from physical transmission of photon states through a standard telecommunications grade optical fiber, to consideration of device imperfections, information reconciliation protocols. In addition, since there are circumstances when a fiber optical link may not be available, we will also discuss a test bench implementation of a Free Space Optics (FSO) QKD link. Furthermore, in spite of the fact that Discrete Variable QKD (DV-QKD) systems have reached a maturity level that allows their potential full realization and implementation for creation of a secure network backbone for key distribution in nations, in realistic links DV-QKD is really limited by technology and physical constraints associated with construction of reliable high rate single photon (or at least low photon count) sources, and of fast and reliable single photon detectors with very low dark count rates. In these cases, the use of Continuous Variable QKD (CV-QKD) schemes may be advantageous. For this reason the paper also discusses the problem of information reconciliation in CV-QKD scenarios, showing that in long distance links the sign of the received Gaussian samples contains the largest fraction of information, leading to the design of an Unequal Error Protection (UEP) reverse reconciliation scheme.

J	HILLIER, FS; SO, KC; BOLING, RW				HILLIER, FS; SO, KC; BOLING, RW			TOWARD CHARACTERIZING THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF STORAGE SPACE IN PRODUCTION LINE SYSTEMS WITH VARIABLE PROCESSING TIMES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												This investigation considers certain issues regarding the optimal design of unpaced production lines with variable processing times. Under certain assumptions, including an equal allocation of buffer storage space between the respective pairs of stations, it is known that the optimal allocation of work is characterized by the ''bowl phenomenon'' whereby the interior stations (especially the center ones) are given preferential treatment (less work) over the end stations. The key question now being posed is: given an equal allocation of work to the respective stations, does the optimal allocation of buffer storage space between the respective pairs of stations follow an analogous pattern (the ''storage bowl phenomenon'') whereby the interior buffers (especially the center ones) are given preferential treatment (more space) over the end buffers? Because the decision variables now are discrete instead of continuous, the answer found in this study is: sometimes, but not in general. Characterizing the optimal allocation of storage space is a surprisingly subtle and complex problem. Despite the ambiguities, one dominant theme that runs throughout all of the results obtained is that, to the extent that preferential treatment in storage space allocations should be given, priority should be given to the interior buffers (especially the center ones) over the end buffers. The other key conclusion is that, when the total amount of storage space also is a decision variable, the overall optimal solution commonly follows a storage bowl phenomenon whereby the allocation of buffer storage space fits an inverted bowl pattern.																			0025-1909					JAN	1993	39	1					126	133		10.1287/mnsc.39.1.126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.39.1.126													WOS:A1993KM62000011

This article explores the use of intermodal road- Roll-on Roll-off (RoRo) transport, in complement with container transport, that is, in a combined HS and PTP network topology for the archipelagic Philippines. The mixed HS network is modeled to incorporate the properties of multiple allocations, non-restrictive networking policy and general hub network topology. The large network problem is solved by a heuristic that uses Lagrangian relaxation as a starting point. The model is able to locate hub ports where cases of intermodal road-RoRo and container transport could transship and be used complementarily. It is shown that considerable savings in total network costs could be realized with a mixed network, as compared with a purely PTP one.

The transmission delays are considered between zero and twice the sampling time, so the networked control system is described in a discrete-time domain, which includes time-varying parameters. The incidence of packet loss is modeled as an independent Bernoulli distributed white sequence. Observer-based feedback controller is presented to render the closed-loop networked system exponentially mean square stable on the foundation of Lyapunov stability theorem around the defined bounded region. The design procedure is perfected via solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Lastly, a numerical example is used to verify the validity of the presented outcomes.

In order to ensure the passivity of the coupled reaction-diffusion neural networks, some adaptive strategies to tune the coupling strengths among network nodes are designed. By utilizing some inequality techniques and the designed adaptive laws, several sufficient conditions ensuring passivity are obtained. In addition, we reveal the relationship between passivity and synchronization of the coupled reaction-diffusion NNs. Based on the obtained passivity results and the relationship between passivity and synchronization, a global synchronization criterion is established.

Here, we describe Tactile Echoes, a finger-wearable system for augmenting touch interactions with physical objects. This system captures and processes touch-elicited vibrations in real-time in order to enliven tactile experiences. In this article, we process these signals via a parametric signal processing network in order to generate responsive tactile and auditory feedback. Just as acoustic echoes are produced through the delayed replication and modification of sounds, so are Tactile Echoes produced through transformations of vibrotactile inputs in the skin. The echoes also reflect the contact interactions and touched objects involved. A transient tap produces discrete echoes, while a continuous slide yields sustained feedback. We also demonstrate computational and spatial tracking methods that allow these effects to be selectively assigned to different objects or actions. A large variety of distinct multisensory effects can be designed via ten processing parameters. We investigated how Tactile Echoes are perceived in several perceptual experiments using multidimensional scaling methods. This allowed us to deduce low-dimensional, semantically grounded perceptual descriptions. We present several virtual and augmented reality applications of Tactile Echoes. In a user study, we found that these effects made interactions more responsive and engaging. Our findings show how to endow a large variety of touch interactions with expressive multisensory effects.

However, many parameterizations include ad hoc components that are not well constrained by theory or data. One such component is the eddy diffusivity model, where vertical turbulent fluxes of a quantity are parameterized from a variable eddy diffusion coefficient and the mean vertical gradient of the quantity. In this work, we improve a parameterization of vertical mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer by enhancing its eddy diffusivity model using data-driven methods, specifically neural networks. The neural networks are designed to take extrinsic and intrinsic forcing parameters as input to predict the eddy diffusivity profile and are trained using output data from a second moment closure turbulent mixing scheme. The modified vertical mixing scheme predicts the eddy diffusivity profile through online inference of neural networks and maintains the conservation principles of the standard ocean model equations, which is particularly important for its targeted use in climate simulations. We describe the development and stable implementation of neural networks in an ocean general circulation model and demonstrate that the enhanced scheme outperforms its predecessor by reducing biases in the mixed-layer depth and upper ocean stratification. Our results demonstrate the potential for data-driven physics-aware parameterizations to improve global climate models.

The approach defines a discrete-even simulation model designed to mimic the dynamic operation and schedule structure of a liner service network of four service routes, 25 container ships, 18 container ports, and 36 port calls a week. Three months planning analysis is considered. The proposed approach includes evaluations of costs related to the operation liners at container ports and at sea. The expected operational results are reported for the overall network and the individual contribution of service routes, ports, and container ships to the network. The results allow for assessing the operation of service routes and defining the set of ports, container ships fleet, and schedules that are performing below and above the expected network level.																					978-88-903724-2-1				2008							129	133																WOS:000275367300020

Based on this discrete model with a multiple delay in two control items, a new model of networked control systems is got by two steps transformation. One control item with time delay is disappeared in this new model. The existing conditions of asymptotic stability for networked control system with long time delay are presented by Lyapunov method and robust control theory. The design method of stabilization controller for networked control system is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Comparing with the results in literature reported, the dimension of LMI used in this paper is the lowest. In the end the simulation based on the networked control unstable system is studied. The simulation results show the proposed controller is feasible and effective.																					978-1-4244-4204-1				2008							174	+																WOS:000270675200036

This paper proposes a multi-period design model to select a best mix of SONET survivable network architectures. These include: 1) point-to-point/hubbing architecture with diverse protection, and 2) ring architecture. The algorithm can be used to study growth strategies, for networks incorporating the ring architecture, that minimize the network evolution cost. Numerical examples show that the algorithm can generate a good solution quickly, using a VAX 6000-420 computer, for most practical applications. A case study suggests that a particular well accepted engineering rule can work well. This engineering rule is: Use direct point-to-point systems in conjunction with self-healing rings and hubbing/diverse protection architectures only when a few demand pairs have appreciably higher demand requirements than other demand pairs. When demand is fairly even, then use self-healing rings or hubbing/diverse protection without direct point-to-point systems.																			0018-9529					OCT	1991	40	4					417	427		10.1109/24.93761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/24.93761													WOS:A1991GH74900004

We formulate the multi-modal last mile system as a two-echelon location-routing problem with mixed vehicles and mixed satellites 1 (2E-LRP-MVMS). A multi-objective optimization model is developed to capture the characteristics of cost components and environmental impact. The goal of the 2E-LRP-MVMS is to determine the location facilities, to optimize the number of parcels delivered to two echelons and routes at each level, also to reduce costs caused by carbon emissions. A hybrid immune algorithm is proposed, and two improved steps, vaccination and immunization are introduced in the algorithm. This research contributes to the last-mile delivery network design domain by modeling the environmental and economic cost of E-Grocery distribution adopting mixed fleets and mixed satellites.

Techniques such as the measurement size reduction, signal quantization and stochastic signal transmission are introduced to achieve the above goal. An uncertain switched system model is first proposed to capture the above-networked uncertainties. Based on the switched system theory and Lyapunov stability approach, a sufficient condition is obtained such that the closed-loop synchronization system is exponentially stable in the mean-square sense with a prescribed H-infinity performance level.

The industry is network-based, so network decision contributes much to the success of any operators. There are many decisions in respect of network optimization such as route and schedule design, port selection, fleet size and mix, fleet assignment and scheduling, container movement. Our paper conducts a literature survey to realize optimization problems, methodologies as well as research tendencies to deal with network optimization in container liner shipping. We focus on three major categories: container routing, fleet management and network design. Container routing is related to optimal flow movement of laden and empty containers. Fleet management is involved with decisions of ship assignment and scheduling. Network design is the problem of choosing ports and combining them to create the infrastructure of shipping operation.

Since the MLR-WDM is becoming the key and a cost-efficient technique for the network upgrading, the problem for constructing an efficient virtual topology becomes an important issue. In this paper, the Virtual Topology Design (VTD) problem on MLR-WDM network is considered. Given the physical backbone network and traffic demand matrix between nodes of the network, the goal of the VTD problem is to determine which node-pairs to be connected by establishing lightpaths, the actual routes of the lightpaths, the transmitting rates of lightpaths, and the assigned wavelengths of lightpaths such that the total cost of deployed transceivers can be minimized. Since the VTD problem on MLR-WDM network is a hard problem, in the paper, a heuristic algorithm (HA) and a genetic algorithm (GA) are proposed to solve it. Experimental results indicate that the proposed GA is robust for this problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional UPS INS (Global Position System/Inertial Navigation System) integration maybe invalid in the outage of GPS signals. The continuous estimation framework and method were proposed to estimate the location in different environments. Firstly, a continuous framework was designed combining the traditional UPS INS integration and the intelligent neural network. The methods were switched according to the condition of sensors to realize the continuous estimation. Secondly, NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs) neural network was built to model the nonlinear mapping relation between INS and GPS. The time series data were analyzed in NARX neural network to excavate the data features in the tune dimension. Lastly, the experiment was conducted to verify the method proposed. And the results showed that the solution is valid in the motion state estimation with INS when GPS is in the outage.

Optimizing the design of these networks is the key to reducing the development costs of oilfields. In the development method of cyclic water injection, some pipelines can be used for both production gathering and water injection; thus, GPN and WIPN can be designed simultaneously. Currently, separate designs do not form a unified scheme, and the cost is high. In view of these shortages, the integrated network should be considered. Based on mass and energy balance equations for networks, this paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that takes the minimum construction investment as the objective function. The piecewise method is used to deal with the nonlinear terms in this model. Two common connection structures of pipeline networks, stellated pipeline networks (SPNs) and cascade dendritic pipeline networks (CDPNs) can be calculated by adjusting several constraints. Decision variables for the optimal locations of the central processing facility (CPF) and manifolds, detailed topological structure, diameter and route of each pipeline, pipeline flow and node pressure are obtained integrally by solving this model with the Gurobi solver. Two cases are studied to verify the effectiveness of the model. The results illustrate that the model can satisfy the needs of the designers in the actual design process, avoiding a qualitative or univariate decision in the comparison of different schemes. Comparing the results with those of the separated design scheme, the proposed model is proved to achieve lower investment costs. Therefore, the proposed model is feasible and practical.

Cross-layer Framework and Condition-based Topology Control for Contested Environments	2015 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (MILCOM 2015)	IEEE Military Communications Conference				34th IEEE Annual Military Communications Conference (MILCOM) on Leveraging Technology - The Joint Imperative	OCT 26-28, 2015	Tampa, FL	IEEE				There has been much work in the open literature on the use of cross-layer information and design to improve overall system performance in wireless networks operating in benign (non-hostile/non-jammed) environments. However, not much work has been devoted to developing a systematic cross-layer framework that lends itself well to housing alternative cross-layer design algorithms for contested networks that are of interest to the Army. In this paper, we describe a flexible, modular and extensible cross-layer framework that can be used both in contested and benign environments to design robust multi-tiered ad hoc communications networks. Our framework is agnostic to the underlying substrate and can be used both on simulation platforms as well as SDR substrates. Using this framework, we also develop a condition-based cross-layer topology control mechanism that provides the ability to create and maintain a robust network amidst hostile network jamming, and present results via discrete event simulations.																			2155-7578		978-1-5090-0073-9				2015							997	1001																WOS:000371395200167

However, the following problems have not been effectively resolved: 1) previous satellite VSR methods cannot achieve continuous-scale (integer and noninteger scale) VSR with a single model; 2) satellite video has complex ground and weak textures, which increases the difficulty of capturing motion information. In addition, existing methods adopt a unified alignment path, which leads to a drop in feature alignment accuracy; and 3) during feature fusion, previous methods ignore the correlation of spatiotemporal information in satellite video and cannot make full use of the spatiotemporal information. To address the above problems, in this article, we propose a novel network for continuous-scale satellite VSR (CSVSR). Specifically, first, for effective motion capture and accurate feature alignment, we design a residual-guided and time-aware dynamic routing alignment module, which can use feature residuals to lock motion areas and then dynamically select the corresponding alignment path based on the temporal distance. Second, we proposed a nonlocal mask-based feature fusion module (NMFFM) to exploit the correlation of the spatiotemporal features and complete effective spatiotemporal feature fusion. Third, to make our network adapt to multitask learning, we develop a scale-aware convolutional (SA-Conv) layer, which lets our network dynamically extract scale-adaptive features according to the input scale factors. Finally, we propose a continuous-scale upsampling module with a global feature implicit function (GFIF), which can achieve continuous-scale mapping from features to pixel values. In addition, we carefully design a novel training strategy to optimize our network. Comprehensive experiments verify that the proposed CSVSR has superior reconstruction performance on continuous-scale factors.																			0196-2892	1558-0644					2024	62								5610017	10.1109/TGRS.2024.3366550	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2024.3366550													WOS:001173263900002

While the commonly seen methodologies may be effective in solving the product mix decision problems from many manufacturing settings, they are not adequate in solving the problems from wafer fabrication facilities due to both the complex nature of the wafer fabrication process and the high tool inventory costs. This paper proposes a combined simulation/neural network based approach to solve the product mix problem for a given tool utilization/WIP level. Solution quality of the proposed methodology is justified through a real world case study. Empirical results illustrate its efficiency and effectiveness in solving a product mix problem for semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities. Significance: Product mix decision for wafer fabrication facilities is intrinsically complicated. The realization of a feasible product mix for a given tool utilization/WIP level will facilitate the planning and control of a manufacturing system. It will also have a significant impact to the tool inventory decision.

The memristor-based neural network further demonstrates a power efficient hardware realization of ANN. Training phase is the critical operation of memristor-based neural network. However, the traditional training method for memristor-based neural network is time consuming and energy inefficient. Users have to first work out the parameters of memristors through digital computing systems and then tune the memristor to the corresponding state. In this work, we introduce a mixed-signal training acceleration framework, which realizes the self-training of memristor-based neural network. We first modify the original stochastic gradient descent algorithm by approximating calculations and designing an alternative computing method. We then propose a mixed-signal acceleration architecture for the modified training algorithm by equipping the original memristor-based neural network architecture with the copy crossbar technique, weight update units, sign calculation units and other assistant units. The experiment on the MNIST database demonstrates that the proposed mixed-signal acceleration is 3 orders of magnitude faster and 4 orders of magnitude more energy efficient than the CPU implementation counterpart at the cost of a slight decrease of the recognition accuracy (< 5%).

Unlike previous studies that employed various machine learning algorithms on diverse concrete types, our study focuses on mixed-design concrete and fine-tuned deep learning algorithms. The objective is to identify the optimal deep learning (DL) algorithm for predicting concrete uniaxial compressive strength, a crucial parameter in construction and structural engineering. The dataset comprises experimental records for mixed-design concrete, and models were developed and optimized for predictive accuracy. The results show that the CNN model consistently outperformed GRU and LSTM. Hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques further improved model performance.

Accordingly, this study develops a novel multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model for a closed-loop green supply chain network design problem. The proposed model aims to minimize the total costs, total CO2 emissions, and robustness costs in both forward and reverse directions, simultaneously. To cope with flexible constraints and epistemic uncertainty in the model's parameters, a robust flexible-possibilistic programming approach is tailored. The model is solved using an efficient interactive solution approach, in which, the presented model is analyzed under various carbon emission mechanisms to assess the influence of these mechanisms on the achieved solution.

We model the network in an NCS as a hidden Markov chain and the network delay as stochastic variable whose probability density function depends on the Markov chain state (i.e. network state). Thus, the network state estimation is a continuous-time hidden Markov model (CTHMM) estimation problem. To derive the CTHMM of the NCS under study, we propose the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the parameters of the CTHMM based on the packet delay observations. The derived CTHMM make it possible in the future for us to predict the next network state and then choose a proper one from several control laws, which have been designed in advance to guarantee the performance of the NCS.																					978-1-4244-2692-8				2009							4649	4654																WOS:000280158102181

Conventional transport planning models usually deal with the network design problem and signal setting problem separately. However, the fact that network capacity design and capacity allocation determined by network signal setting combine to govern the transport network performance requires the optimal transport planning to consider the two problems simultaneously. In this study, a combined network capacity expansion and signal setting model with consideration of vehicle queuing on approaching legs of intersection is developed to consider their mutual interactions so that best transport network performance can be guaranteed.

Design of a new impedance tuning network by using RC mutator	MICROWAVE AND OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												The design of broadband active-compensated antenna system is an important problem in commercial satellite, military, and high-speed communication systems. And so, impedance matching networks are used extensively in radio transmission and receiving systems. In this paper, broadband impedance Matching is proposed as a method to improve the matching level of microstrip antennas. The theoretical design, fabrication, and experimental implementation of compensated rectangular microstrip antenna with new configuration pi-matching network were presented. A new compensation network consisting of RC mutator circuit and discrete capacitors are employed at the input of the microstrip antenna operating at 2.5 GHz. The performance parameters of the designed microstrip antenna with and without compensation network were compared. The results show that compensation network can improve the return loss level from - 5.9 to - 13.01 dB and the resonant frequency can be controlled in a wide RF band.

This antenna is designed to cover the downlink (17.7-20.2 GHz) and the uplink (27.5-30 GHz) bands. This array comprises 16 long slots fed in parallel by a corrugated parallel plate waveguide beam forming network. The design and simulations results are summarized, together with a simple design methodology for different network components. The dual-linear polarization is achieved by using two orthogonal modes namely: the quasi- transverse electric magnetic mode (QTEM) and the 1st order transverse electric mode (QTE(1)). The antenna array is well matched (S-11 < - 10 dB). The maximum realized gain (in one plane) is around 15 dB at 29 GHz and around 12 dB at 19 GHz for both polarizations.																			2157-9822		978-1-6654-7110-7				2022							146	148		10.1109/MMS55062.2022.9825511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MMS55062.2022.9825511													WOS:000855047100032

Such networks usually consist of an access layer, a backbone layer, and maybe several intermediate layers. The nodes of each layer must be connected to those of the next layer in a tree-like fashion. The backbone layer must satisfy survivability and IP-routing constraints. Given the node locations, the demands between them, the possible connections and hardware configurations, and various other technical and administrational constraints, the goal is to decide, which node is assigned to which network level, how the nodes are connected, what hardware must be installed, and how traffic is routed in the backbone. Mixed integer linear programming models and solution methods are presented for both the access and the backbone network design problem. The focus is on the design of IP-over-SDH networks, but the access network design model and large parts of the backbone network design models are general and also applicable for other types of communication networks. Results obtained with these methods in the planning of the German research network are presented.

The WEEE directive gives responsibility to producers for developing a system for recycling and disposal activities and handle all associated costs. This study proposes a mixed integer programming model for decision-makers to manage their activities on the WEEE closed-loop supply chain network. A decision-maker may be a single producer of any size or a managing body formed by a group of producers and/or third-party companies in the network. The model contributes to the research field by integrating product returns with different quality and damage levels. A set of scenarios was designed to evaluate the effects of the directive and the network design related issues (e.g., the minimum collection rates, the number of producers and stores in the network) on the objective function. The results indicate that the capacity balance among stores, producers, and recovery centers is vital to make the network profitable and sustainable.

Ecos are open-architecture artificial neural networks with a dynamically evolving structure that is automatically adjusted by the training algorithm thereby overcoming the limitations associated with conventional and constructive artificial neural networks. Two Ecos methods are investigated - the dynamic evolving neuro-fuzzy inference system (Denfis) and the evolving fuzzy neural network (EFuNN). Preliminary investigations show that Ecos-based hot-mix asphalt |E*| predictive modelling is a promising alternative to regression-based methods, although not as powerful as traditional multi-layered perceptron back-propagation artificial neural networks.

Factors influencing the strengths were examined to determine the appropriate parameters for the ANN models. The optimized input parameters using training and development of ANN models were used to formulate the regression models. The ANN and regression models were tested with new sets of data for performance validation. Based on the good agreement and other statistical performance parameters, optimized ANN and regression models capable of predicting the strengths of ECC mixtures (using arbitrary mix design parameters) were developed and suggested for practical applications.

This converging flow network is basically using the mechanisms of fluid multilamination for mixing enhancement. Simulations are made on the flow behavior to investigate the effect of branching numbers, hierarchy levels, geometrical sizes and other design parameters using FEM methods. A rapid prototyping system for microfluidics using PDMS molding technology was successfully utilized to fabricate the designed multichannel micromixer. Experimentally, image processing technique was used to characterize flow and mixing quality in the microfluidic structure. Obtained results from numerical simulation and experimental measurements are compared with a single channel with equal flow length using the mixing quality index. This improved micromixer can further be optimized in terms of fractal shapes and numbers and geometrical size for specific applications.

Without geometric correlations, multiplexes exhibit an abrupt breakdown of mutual connectivity, even with interlayer degree correlations. With geometric correlations, we instead observe a multistep cascading process leading into a continuous transition, which apparently becomes fully continuous in the thermodynamic limit.

Regarding the MPC algorithm for the discrete-time time-delay systems, the existing literature only considers the linear case. In this study, by designing the suitable terminal cost and terminal region, the MPC scheme is firstly investigated for the non-linear case. Meanwhile, to reduce the computational burden of MPC using the existing model types (e.g. recurrent neural network) as the identified model, an RMTN possessing the concise structure and high computational efficiency is constructed to approximate the state-space model of the system. After trained by the backpropagation through time algorithm, the RMTN obtaining the high accuracy of prediction over a long-range horizon is capable of serving as the prediction model in the MPC scheme. Furthermore, aiming at alleviating the adverse effect of the inevitable identification error, the tube-based MPC is proposed via leveraging dual-mode MPC to guarantee that actual trajectory is contained within a robust tube. The stability of the considered system is proved theoretically, and numerical simulation is employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

An Intelligent Scheme for Categorization and Tracing of Shunt Abnormalities in Compensated Power Transmission Network	JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS												This paper presents an intelligent protection mechanism for series compensated power network. It principally focuses on identifying and locating the fault events in the network by applying transient signal processing and intelligent computing technique. It involves realization of prime characteristic features from the 3-phase post-fault current signal using discrete wavelet transform decomposition. The realized feature sets (i.e. the entropy of DWT coefficients) are utilized as the input data set to the designed classifier and distance appraisal model. The designed classifier and distance estimator model predicts the type of events and its actuating point in the network as their final output. The probabilistic neural network technique based classifier model has been employed in present work for classifying the shunt abnormality events in the compensated power network. For tracing the location of shunt fault in the network, a cascaded-forward network model has been utilized. Various test cases with varying network operating conditions have been performed on two different simulated test networks in MATLAB for evaluating the competency and feasibility of the proposed intelligent protection scheme. The results enlisted after different considered fault scenario, have vindicated the applicability and strength of the proposed intelligent protection mechanism for ascertaining the class and location of actuation of fault events in a compensated power network.

J	Zhan, C; Xiao, FY				Zhan, Cheng; Xiao, Fuyuan			Coding-based Storage Design for Continuous Data Collection in Wireless Sensor Networks	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS												In-network storage is an effective technique for avoiding network congestion and reducing power consumption in continuous data collection in wireless sensor networks. In recent years, network coding based storage design has been proposed as a means to achieving ubiquitous access that permits any query to be satisfied by a few random (nearby) storage nodes. To maintain data consistency in continuous data collection applications, the readings of a sensor over time must be sent to the same set of storage nodes. In this paper, we present an efficient approach to updating data at storage nodes to maintain data consistency at the storage nodes without decoding out the old data and re-encoding with new data. We studied a transmission strategy that identifies a set of storage nodes for each source sensor that minimizes the transmission cost and achieves ubiquitous access by transmitting sparsely using the sparse matrix theory. We demonstrate that the problem of minimizing the cost of transmission with coding is NP-hard. We present an approximation algorithm based on regarding every storage node with memory size B as B tiny nodes that can store only one packet. We analyzed the approximation ratio of the proposed approximation solution, and compared the performance of the proposed coding approach with other coding schemes presented in the literature. The simulation results confirm that significant performance improvement can be achieved with the proposed transmission strategy.

It is assumed that the packet losses may occur in the control channel from the sensor to the observer. A suitable compensation strategy via the Bernoulli distributed random variable is used to reduce the effects of packet losses. In order to avoid the phenomenon of network congestion during the networked transmission, an event-triggered mechanism is introduced to determine if the last released measurement needs to be updated. Based on the zero-order-hold (ZOH) measurement, an output feedback observer is designed to reconstruct the system state. This method can facilitate the design of the discrete-time sliding surface. A sufficient condition is proposed to guarantee the stochastic stability of sliding mode dynamics systems by using linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, and a novel observer-based sliding mode controller is synthesized to force the trajectories of the error systems onto the pre-designed sliding mode surface within finite time. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the validity of the proposed theoretical result.

The existence of such a continuous mapping eliminates the need for linear independency of the active constraints, and therefore the resulting analytic constrained predictive controller will combine constraint handling with speed while being applicable to fast and complex control systems with many constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed controller design methodology is shown for a simulation example of an elevator model and for a real-time laboratory inverted pendulum system.

However, the flexibility challenges the current generation of neural network architectures that seldom involve the target platform as the bounds during the structure searching. The difficult deployment is rooted in the hidden resource provision of the target devices during the SW/HW joint tuning, leading to mismatching between network models and system configuration. This work proposes a scalable neural network search service in the 5G environment to support a continuous knob of the network scales, by which the channel groups can overlap with each other to share the features with continuous coverage. It is proved that the proposed dimension of network scaling provides good predictability of the model performance on specific platforms, which can be further utilized to simplify the regular network architectural search procedures. Then we design a SW/HW co-design workflow that involves both the cloud and edge to fully utilize computing resources on target platforms, meanwhile keeping the network size as small as possible to save the provision of resources. The experimental results show that, with our scalable search service, the key metrics of the network model enjoy a continuous, monotonic, and linear function to the proposed hyper-parameter. The deployment to the Raspberry Pi board shows that the proposed method accurately controls both precision and size of the models; meanwhile, the corresponding search workflow successfully finds the proper network scales with 65 percent reduction of the NAS routines.

The dc distribution system comprises several dc sources, here called subsystems, along with resistive and constant-power loads (CPLs.) Each subsystem includes a dc-dc converter (DDC) and exploits distributed energy resources (DERs) such as photovoltaic, wind, etc. Due to the power system frequent disturbances this system is prone to instability in the presence of the DDC dynamical components. On the other hand, designing a centralized controller may not be viable due to the distance between the subsystems (dc sources.) Therefore, in this paper the stability of the interconnected dc distribution system is enhanced through decentralized adaptive nonlinear controller design that employs neural networks (NNs) to mitigate voltage and power oscillations after disturbances have occurred. The adaptive NN-based controller is introduced to overcome the unknown dynamics of each subsystem's converter and stabilize the entire grid, assuming that only the local measurements are available to each converter. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the approach in damping oscillations that occur in the presence of disturbances.

First, we address the local qualitative properties and global qualitative aspects of the class of neural networks considered. Our approach to the stability analysis of the equilibrium points of the network gives insight into the extent of the domain of attraction for the patterns to be stored as asymptotically stable equilibrium points and is useful in the analysis of the retrieval performance of the network and also for design purposes. By making use of the analysis results as constraints, the design for associative memory is performed by solving a constraint optimization problem whereby each of the stored patterns is guaranteed a substantial domain of attraction. The performance of the designed network is illustrated by means of three specific examples.																			0899-7667	1530-888X				FEB	2000	12	2					451	472		10.1162/089976600300015871	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089976600300015871								10636951					WOS:000084864300011

Travis			Freeway network design with exclusive lanes for automated vehicles under endogenous mobility demand	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES												Automated vehicles (AV) have the potential to provide cost-effective mobility options along with overall system-level benefits in terms of congestion and vehicular emissions. Additional resource allocation at the network level, such as AV-exclusive lanes, can further foster the usage of AVs rendering this mode of travel more attractive than legacy vehicles (LV). However, it is necessary to find the crucial locations in the network where providing these dedicated lanes would reap the maximum benefits. In this study, we propose an integrated mixed-integer programming framework for optimal AV-exclusive lane design on freeway networks which accounts for commuters' demand split among AVs and LVs via a logit model incorporating class-based utilities. We incorporate the link transmission model (LTM) as the underlying traffic flow model due to its computational efficiency for system optimum dynamic traffic assignment. The LTM is modified to integrate two vehicle classes namely, LVs and AVs with a lane-based approach. The presence of binary variables to represent lane design and the logit model for endogenous demand estimation results in a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program formulation. We propose a Benders' decomposition approach to tackle this challenging optimization problem. Our approach iteratively explores possible lane designs in the Benders' master problem and, at each iteration, solves a sequence of system-optimum dynamic traffic assignment problems in an attempt to find fixed-points representative of logit-compatible demand splits. The proposed approach is implemented on three hypothetical freeway networks with single and multiple origins and destinations. Our numerical results reveal that the optimal lane design of freeway network is non-trivial while accounting for endogenous demand of each mode.

However, it is not enough to apply or practice recycled aggregate concrete for structural object. It is reason that the development of compressive strength is less than that of normal concrete in the concrete made with recycled aggregates due to the characteristic of recycled aggregate. Moreover, in spite of recognizing the difference between recycled aggregate and natural aggregate, the existing mix proportion for normal concrete has been applied to mix proportion of concrete made with recycled aggregate. The purpose of this research is to develop 'Web-Based Prediction System for Recycled Aggregate Concrete' that provides an accurate prediction values of compressive strength and mixing proportion on the recycled aggregate concrete under characteristic of recycled aggregate.

A (mixed) covering array A of type Pi(i=1)(k) g(i) is a k x N array with the cells of row i filled with elements from Z(gi) and having the property that for every two rows i and j and every ordered pair of elements (e, f) is an element of Z(gi) X Z(gj), there exists at least one column c, 1 less than or equal to c less than or equal to N, such that A(i,c) = e and A(j,c) = f. The (mixed) covering array number, denoted by ca(Pi(i=1)(k) g(i)), is the minimum N for which a covering array of type Pi(i=1)(k) g(i) with N columns exists.

Discrete event model can be used to simulate network information transmission activities and to evaluate the network transmission time reliability. Process Interaction (PI) model, one of main discrete event simulation strategies, can be regarded as a network system with a series of stochastic processes which describe the network activities occurring at random points of time. In this paper we use the PI simulation method to analyze the network transmission time reliability with the consideration of multi-state nodes. In order to study how node states affect transmission time, it is necessary to build network nodes state model to describe network degradation process through a set of states. Then we propose simulation models of network transmission time based on PI method. The detailed design of network information transmission processes is discussed. The simulation algorithm about how to impel the simulation clock is illustrated based on PI method. Meanwhile the simulation models of network structure and routing information are also described in this paper. At last, a simulation case is given to verify the correctness of the network transmission time reliability simulation method proposed in the paper.																			2166-5656		978-1-4673-8554-1				2015																								WOS:000380490300008

JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE												Many studies have investigated machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of wireless body area networks (WBANs). However, it was difficult to evaluate algorithms in a network simulator because of missing interfaces between the simulators and machine learning libraries. To solve the problem of compatibility, some researchers have attempted to interconnect existing network simulators and artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks. For example, ns3-gym is a simple interface between ns-3 (in C++) and the AI model (in Python) based on message queues and sockets. However, the most essential part is the implementation of an integrated event scheduler, which is left to the user. In this study, we aim to develop a new integrated event scheduler. We present BANSIM, a discrete-event network simulator for WBAN in standard Python that supports deep reinforcement learning (DRL). BANSIM provides an intuitive and simple DRL development environment with basic packet communication and BAN-specific components, such as the human mobility model and on-body channel model. Using BANSIM, users can easily build a WBAN environment, design a DRL-based protocol, and evaluate its performance. We experimentally demonstrated that BANSIM captured a wide range of interactions that occurred in the network. Finally, we verified the completeness and applicability of BANSIM by comparing it with an existing network simulator.

The aim of the paper is to design periodically intermittent control such that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and by using some useful lemmas and some new analysis techniques, the researchers generate novel exponential stabilization criteria to ensure the robust exponential stabilization of considered uncertain neutral neural networks in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Based on the proposed criteria, an intermittent state-feedback controller design approach is introduced. Some numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and benefits of the theoretical results.																			0941-0643	1433-3058				APR	2020	32	7			SI		2651	2664		10.1007/s00521-018-3671-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-018-3671-2													WOS:000522553100056

Several system designs have been proposed in the literature, of which a number have been implemented and are used by diverse groups, such as journalists, human rights workers, the military, and ordinary citizens, to protect their identities on the Internet. In this work, we survey the previous research done to design, develop, and deploy systems for enabling private and anonymous communication on the Internet. We identify and describe the major concepts and technologies in the field, including mixes and mix networks, onion routing, and Dining Cryptographers networks. We will also review powerful traffic analysis attacks that have motivated improvements and variations on many of these anonymity protocols made since their introduction. Finally, we will summarize some of the major open problems in anonymous communication research and discuss possible directions for future work in the field.																			0360-0300	1557-7341				DEC	2009	42	1							5	10.1145/1592451.1592456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1592451.1592456													WOS:000273219500005
J	Pereira, J; Vilà, M				Pereira, Jordi; Vila, Mariona			A new model for supply chain network design with integrated assembly line balancing decisions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH												Supply chain network design aims at the integration of the different actors of a supply chain within a single framework in order to optimise the total profit of the system. In this paper, we consider the integration of line balancing issues within the tactical decisions of the supply chain, and we offer a novel model and a solution approach for the problem. The new approach decomposes the problem into multiple line balancing problems and a mixed integer linear model, which is easier to solve than the previously available non-linear mixed integer formulation. The results show that the new method is able to solve previously studied models within a fraction of the reported running times, and also allows us to solve larger instances than those reported in earlier works. Finally, we also provide some analysis on the influence of the cost structure, the demand and the structure of the assembly process on the final configuration of the assemblies and the distribution network.

The communication links between the plant and the FD filter (FDF) are assumed to be imperfect, and the missing probability is governed by an individual random variable satisfying a certain probabilistic distribution over the interval [0 1]. The discrete-time delayed fuzzy networked system is first transformed into the form of interconnect ion of two subsystems by applying an input-output method and a two-term approximation approach, which are employed to approximate the time-varying delay. Our attention is focused on the design of fuzzy FDF (FFDF) such that, for all data missing conditions, the overall FD dynamics are input-output stable in mean square and preserves a guaranteed performance. Sufficient conditions are first established via H-infinity performance analysis for the existence of the desired FFDF; meanwhile, the corresponding solvability conditions for the desired FFDF gains are characterised in terms of the feasibility of a convex optimisation problem. Moreover, we show that the obtained criteria based on the input-output approach can also be established by applying the direct Lyapunov method to the original time-delay systems. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

J	Ekmen, M; Altin-Kayhan, A				Ekmen, Merve; Altin-kayhan, Aysegul			Reliable and energy efficient wireless sensor network design via conditional multi-copying for multiple central nodes	COMPUTER NETWORKS												Design of reliable wireless sensor networks considering energy efficiency is of utmost importance given their specific application domains and technical properties. As a contribution to the vast literature on resilient and fault tolerant network design, this paper offers a novel energy efficient conditional multi-copy and multi-path routing strategy. The motivation is to use limited energy of sensors as efficiently as possible and to improve network reliability and security via restricted redundant data generation. Namely, rather than all only the data passing through some central nodes are duplicated as a precaution against their malfunctioning. A limited number of nodes with higher data transmission allowance are determined as central at the design stage considering lifetime maximization objective. Consequently, 0-1 mixed integer programming models of two variants of the proposed strategy are presented in order to determine optimal routing. Moreover, several valid inequalities so as to improve solution times with commercial solvers and an efficient heuristic method for finding good solutions for large instances in reasonable times are proposed. Extensive test results show that simple restricted multi-copy strategies where every sensor duplicates its data are improved since the proposed strategies provide comparable levels of network reliability and yet extend network lifetime significantly.

By adopting street configuration and land-use mix as variables of neighborhood permeability, this study analyzed whether permeable street configuration and mixed land use that triggers ordinary routine activities could impact residential burglary risks. Findings show that well-integrated road networks, both global and local, and certain types of commercial facilities (i.e., offices and grocery stores) were negatively associated with the crime density of residential burglary.

By utilizing stochastic analysis methods, some sufficient conditions are established to guarantee both the exponentially mean-square stability and the l(2)-l(infinity) performance.

The emerging pruning/binarization methods, which aim at both decreasing overheads and retaining high performance, seem to promise applications on portable devices. However, even with these most advanced algorithms, we have to save the full-precision weights during the gradient descent process which remains size and power bottlenecks of memory access and the resulting computation. To address this challenge, we propose a unified discrete state transition (DST) framework by introducing a probabilistic projection operator that constrains the weight matrices in a discrete weight space (DWS) with configurable number of states, throughout the whole training process. The experimental results over various data sets including MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN show the effectiveness of this framework. The direct transition between discrete states significantly saves memory for storing weights in full precision, as well as simplifies the computation of weight updating. The proposed DST framework is hardware friendly as it can be easily implemented by a wide range of emerging portable devices, including binary, ternary and multiple-level memory devices. This work paves the way for on-chip learning on various portable devices in the near future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Then an optimal water network design with the minimum freshwater usage and wastewater generation is synthesized. In the next step, an integrated water-using and wastewater treatment network is synthesized.

Ever-increasing demand for steel products enforces the steel producers to expand their production and storage capacities. The main purpose of the paper includes preparing a countrywide production, inventory, distribution, and capacity expansion plan to design an SSC network. The SSC networks consist of iron ore mines as suppliers, raw steel producer companies as producers, and downstream steel companies as customers. Demand is assumed stochastic with normal distribution and known at the beginning of planning horizon. To achieve the service level of interest, a potential production capacity along with two kinds of safety stocks including emergency and shared safety stocks are suggested by the authors. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model and a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model are presented to design dynamic multi-commodity SSC networks. To evaluate the performance of the MILP model, a real case of SSC network design is solved. Furthermore, solving two proposed models by using a commercial solver for a set of numerical test cases shows that the MILP model outperforms MINLP in medium- and large-scale problems in terms of computational time. Finally, the complexity of the linear model is investigated by relaxing some major assumptions.

A directed graph is first constructed to represent the combinational travel network for both candidate trains and passengers. Through this graph, it is easy to simultaneously describe trains' operation choices, passengers' travel choices, and their restrictive relations. Based on it, a mixed-integer linear programming model with many binary and non-negative integer decision variables is built to simultaneously optimize the line plan, timetable, and passenger travel choices, which can be efficiently solved using commercial solver CPLEX for small-scale network, while a decomposition strategy is required to combine with CPLEX for large-scale network. A set of numerical experiments are carried out to analyse the impacts of flow sub-units, number of candidate trains, and weight factors. Finally, we conduct two case studies for testing the practicability of our proposed method.					deng, lianbo/AAI-1079-2020; Li, Binxu/KDO-3273-2024	Zhou, Wenliang/0000-0003-2401-1049; Li, Xiang/0000-0003-2557-8899; yang, xia (Sarah)/0000-0002-6536-6690													2324-9935	2324-9943				JAN 1	2020	16	3					1333	1374		10.1080/23249935.2020.1748748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23249935.2020.1748748													WOS:000526682800001

By choosing appropriate Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions for the existence of quantized H-infinity controller is derived, such that the closed-loop discrete-time networked control systems is robustly asymptotically mean-square stable and preserves a guaranteed H-infinity performance. An improved design criterion for quantized H-infinity controller is formulated in the form of nonconvex matrix inequalities, and the cone complementary linearization (CCL) procedure is exploited to solve the nonconvex feasibility problem.

To address actuation in such closed-loop wireless control systems there is a strong need to rethink the communication architectures and protocols for reliability, coordination, and control. We introduce the Embedded Virtual Machine (EVM), a programming abstraction where controller tasks with their control and timing properties are maintained across physical node boundaries and functionality is capable of migrating to the most competent set of physical controllers. In the context of process and discrete control, an EVM is the distributed runtime system that dynamically selects primary-backup sets of controllers given spatial and temporal constraints of the underlying wireless network. EVM-based algorithms allow network control algorithms to operate seamlessly over less reliable wireless networks with topological changes. They introduce new capabilities such as predictable outcomes during sensor/actuator failure, adaptation to mode changes, and runtime optimization of resource consumption. An automated design flow from Simulink to platform-independent domain-specific languages, and subsequently, to platform-dependent code generation is presented. Through case studies in discrete and process control we demonstrate the capabilities of EVM-based wireless network control systems.

The main issue of such performance studies is to secure proper statistical accuracy of the final simulation results. In DESC++ this problem has been solved by automating analysis of simulation output data, aimed at stopping simulation when the estimates reach the required level of precision. The package consists of various object classes. While some of them are responsible for on-line output data analysis, others allow simulation programs of telecommunication networks to be easily developed by re-using existing (sub)models. We discuss main design and implementational issues of DESC++, and illustrate them by an example.

However, with the emergence of new concerns like climate change and high-density urbanization, those designs must also be reliable and resilient. This is the objective of the present research, to provide an approach for finding low-cost, sewer networks design while considering the reliability and the resilience as a criterion in the selection of the best design. For that purpose, a method is proposed for evaluating resilience and reliability in a variety of designs produced by modifying the objective function of the network's layout selection model. The methodology was tested in four scenarios using two cost equations and two sewer network benchmarks from the literature. In most of the scenarios, it was possible to find designs with lower cost and higher resilience and reliability than those previously published.					; Saldarriaga, Juan G./R-3070-2016	Herran, Juana/0000-0002-3606-6234; Saldarriaga, Juan G./0000-0003-1265-2949													1573-062X	1744-9006				2023 JUN 2	2023										10.1080/1573062X.2023.2218339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1573062X.2023.2218339		JUN 2023											WOS:000998371800001
J	Ramos, G; Pequito, S				Ramos, Guilherme; Pequito, Sergio			Designing communication networks for discrete-time consensus for performance and privacy guarantees	SYSTEMS & CONTROL LETTERS												Discrete-time consensus plays a key role in multi-agent systems and distributed protocols. Unfortunately, due to the self-loop dynamics of the agents (an agent's current state depends only on its own immediately previous state, i.e., one time-step in the past), they often lack privacy guarantees. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel design that consists of a network augmentation, where each agent uses the previous iteration values and the newly received ones to increase the privacy guarantees. To formally evaluate the privacy of a network of agents, we define the concept of privacy index, which intuitively measures the minimum number of agents that should work in coalition to recover all the initial states. Moreover, we aim to explore if there is a trade-off between privacy and accuracy (rate of convergence) or if we can increase both. We unveil that, with the proposed method, we can design networks with higher privacy index and faster convergence rates. Remarkably, we further ensure that the network always reaches consensus even when the original network does not. Finally, we illustrate the proposed method with examples and present networks that lead to higher privacy levels and, in the majority of the cases, to faster consensus rates.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

WHEN is designed by water network (WN) followed by heat exchanger network (HEN) in sequential step. First, WN is designed by mass balance from sources to sinks. Second, HEN is designed by matching hot waste streams and cold sink streams to satisfy the outlet temperature. The main objective is to minimize total annual cost (TAO) of freshwater cost, piping cost, investment cost of heat exchanger unit, and hot/cold utility cost using developing case study data. Mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) is developed for simultaneous design by cascading calculation.

J	Min, Y; Jin, XG; Ge, Y; Chang, J				Min, Yong; Jin, Xiaogang; Ge, Ying; Chang, Jie			The Role of Community Mixing Styles in Shaping Epidemic Behaviors in Weighted Networks	PLOS ONE												The dynamics of infectious diseases that are spread through direct contact have been proven to depend on the strength of community structure or modularity within the underlying network. It has been recently shown that weighted networks with similar modularity values may exhibit different mixing styles regarding the number of connections among communities and their respective weights. However, the effect of mixing style on epidemic behavior was still unclear. In this paper, we simulate the spread of disease within networks with different mixing styles: a dense-weak style (i.e., many edges among the communities with small weights) and a sparse-strong style (i.e., a few edges among the communities with large weights). Simulation results show that, with the same modularity: 1) the mixing style significantly influences the epidemic size, speed, pattern and immunization strategy; 2) the increase of the number of communities amplifies the effect of the mixing style; 3) when the mixing style changes from sparse-strong to dense-weak, there is a 'saturation point', after which the epidemic size and pattern become stable. We also provide a mean-field solution of the epidemic threshold and size on weighted community networks with arbitrary external and internal degree distribution. The solution explains the effect of the second moment of the degree distribution, and a symmetric effect of internal and external connections (incl. degree distribution and weight). Our study has both potential significance for designing more accurate metrics for the community structure and exploring diffusion dynamics on metapopulation networks.																			1932-6203					FEB 20	2013	8	2							e57100	10.1371/journal.pone.0057100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057100								23437321					WOS:000315184200214

The considered system is deduced by the structure of RBFNN with nonzero time-varying parameter that installed in the fore-end and terminal of RBFNN. With this structure and the Taylor expansion of any smooth continuous nonlinear function, a universal approximation of RBFNN is addressed according to the analysis of the character of continuous homogenous function and the Euler's theorem. The approximation accuracies can be adjusted online by the nonzero time-varying parameter in the device with the degree of continuous homogenous function, which expand the semiglobally stability to global stability over conventional neural controller design approaches. Based on the theory analysis of barrier Lyapunov function, the violation of time-varying constraints can be subjugated without wrecked.

Similarly, there is an impetus for organizations to become more environmentally conscious or green. This environmental context has driven many organizations to invest in green technologies, with a recent emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This environmental investment situation and decision can be addressed through the integration of facility location, operational planning, and vehicle type selection, while simultaneously accounting for carbon emissions from vehicles, inspection centers, and remanufacturing centers in a reverse logistics (RL) context. In the current study, we present a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve a multi-tier multi-period green RL network, including vehicle type selection. This research integrates facility locations, vehicle type selection with emissions producing from transportation and operations at various processing centers. Prior research does not account for carbon emissions for this design problem type. Valuable managerial insights are obtained when incorporating carbon emissions cost.

In many such applications, the environmental data are continuously sensed, and data collection by a server is only performed occasionally. Hence, the sensor nodes have to temporarily store the data, and provide easy and on-hand access for the most updated data when the server approaches. Given the expensive server-to-sensor communications, the large amount of sensors and the limited storage space at each tiny sensor, continuous data collection becomes a challenging problem. In this article, we present partial network coding (PNC) as a generic tool for these applications. PNC generalizes the existing network coding (NC) paradigm, an elegant solution for ubiquitous data distribution and collection. Yet PNC allows efficient storage replacement for continuous data, which is a deficiency of the conventional NC. We prove that the performance of PNC is quite close to NC, except for a sub-linear overhead on storage and communications. We then address a set of practical concerns toward PNC-based continuous data collection in sensor networks. Its feasibility and superiority are further demonstrated through simulation results.

The former has been mainly studied in terms of optimal design of utility supply network. The latter has been consistently researched in the field of strategic planning of future global hydrogen supply network. In this work, we develop an integrated network model of huge chemical industrial complexes to combine various utility supply networks with a global hydrogen supply network. To construct an integrated network model, the steam methane reforming process is used as a linkage between the two networks. The developed model is a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming that optimizes total cost and also considers demand uncertainty about water, electricity, steam, and hydrogen that are consumed in each network. Finally, a case study in South Korea is conducted to validate the proposed model; it suggests reasonable scenarios to decision makers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wireless ad-hoc networks are a new form of wireless communications that do not rely on any fixed infrastructure like wired base stations to keep the network up and running. Instead, hosts in a wireless ad-hoc network rely on each other to keep the network connected over either radio or infrared. Since direct communication is allowed only between adjacent nodes, distant nodes in an ad-hoc network communicate over multiple hops. We examine the optimal design of such networks by modeling the problem as a mixed integer mathematical program, and deriving solution procedures based on Lagrangean Relaxation (LR). Using the LR, we were able to decompose the network design problem into two fairly-easy-to-solve sub-problems. We present algorithms for each sub-problem, and an overall heuristic based on LR to solve the design problem. From the computational experiments we have done, our Lagrangean relaxation based algorithms can generate solutions within 2.20-13.16% of optimality. In addition, our algorithm also solves the design problem very rapidly, within a few minutes in the most complex case.																					1-4020-7318-6				2003	23						47	64																WOS:000181293700003

A pivotal highlight is the adaptive auxiliary signal of the actuator fault, which is designed to offset the effect of the fault. The considered systems are in strict-feedback forms and involve unknown nonlinear functions, which will result in the causal problem. To solve this problem, the original nonlinear systems are transformed into a novel system by employing the diffeomorphism theory. Besides, the action neural networks (ANNs) are utilized to approximate a predefined unknown function in the backstepping design procedure. Combined the strategic utility function and the ACD technique, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to set up an optimal FTC, in which the critic neural networks (CNNs) provide an approximate structure of the cost function. In this case, it not only guarantees the stability of the systems, but also achieves the optimal control performance as well. In the end, two simulation examples are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed optimal FTC strategy.

J	Grassi, G				Grassi, G			Discrete-time cellular neural networks for associative memories with application to pattern classification	JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS												This paper focuses on Discrete-Time Cellular Neural Networks (DTCNNs) for associative memories with application to pattern classification. At first, DTCNNs with a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point are designed to behave as associative memories. The objective is achieved by considering feedback parameters related to circulant matrices and by satisfying frequency domain stability criteria. The approach, by generating DTCNNs where the input data are fed via external inputs rather than initial conditions, enables both hetero-associative and auto-associative memories to be designed. Numerical examples are reported in order to show the capabilities of the design tool. Successively, an application of DTCNNs to pattern classification is illustrated. Namely, it is shown that patterns belonging to the training set as well as patterns outside it can be reliably classified using the proposed design method. Comparisons with well-established classification techniques, such as signature technique and modified Fourier descriptor technique, clearly highlight the performances of the approach developed herein.																			0218-1266					AUG	2003	12	4					491	503		10.1142/S0218126603000994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218126603000994													WOS:000187713800009

The problem of dynamic network design considering multi-period pricing has become a new challenging problem in fourth party logistics (4PL) operation mode. This paper uses demand scenarios to describe stochastic demand. Through the relationship between price and demand, a method to obtain the freight price levels is introduced. The mixed integer programming model is established to maximize network profit under limited investment. The performance and application of the model are investigated through two reasonable scale examples. The numerical results show that the solutions obtained by using CPLEX solver to solve the small-scale example of the mixed integer programming model are acceptable. Moreover, numerical experiments analysis the influence of maximum investment cost and multi-period pricing. The results demonstrate the significance of the proposed model and multi-period pricing.

This paper focuses on product adoption probability prediction in the context of large social networks, which paves the way for demand modeling. Traditional approaches to demand modeling in design are mainly based on customer preferences, such as utility theory or discrete choice models, which neglect the importance of explicitly modeling of customers purchase (i.e., adoption) decisions. The paper presents an integrated approach to quantify social network effects on customer choice behavior and predict product adoption probabilities through data mining from large-scale social media data.

In view of NCSs with many independent sensors and actuators, a discrete-time model with multiple time-varying delays is proposed. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a new less conservative stability criterion is developed in terms of linear matrix inequality. On the basis of the obtained stability condition, a static output feedback controller can be designed by applying an iterative algorithm.

To stabilize this class of Networked Control Systems (NCSs), a new Mixed Event Triggered Control (METC) control scheme, including memory data, is proposed to cope with actuator faults modeled as both additive and multiplicative terms acting as uncertainties in a non -fragile control law. Then, from a convenient choice of a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, together with appropriate relaxation techniques, providing boundedness conditions for actuator faults and assuming a prescribed infinity disturbance attenuation level, relaxed LMI-based conditions are proposed to guarantee the non -fragile closed -loop NCS stability with METC. Two theorems are proposed. The first one deals with the NCSs stability analysis (i.e. assuming the controller's gains known), and the second one extends to their stabilization (i.e. the non -fragile controller design). Both these theorems allow the simultaneous design of the proposed METC condition. The proposed LMI-based conditions allow to further relax the admissible network -induced delay and event -triggered packet release intervals. Three simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed METC design and highlight the conservatism improvements brought by this proposal with respect to previous related results from the literature.

However, most models directly include the signal-to-interference ratios representing service coverage conditions. This leads to mixed-integer linear programs with constraint matrices containing tiny coefficients that vary widely in their order of magnitude. These formulations are known to be challenging even for state-of-the-art solvers: the standard numerical precision supported by these solvers is usually not sufficient to reliably guarantee feasible solutions. Service coverage errors are thus commonly present. Though these numerical issues are known and become evident even for small-sized instances, just a very limited number of papers has tried to tackle them, by mainly investigating alternative non-compact formulations in which the sources of numerical instabilities are eliminated. In this work, we explore a new approach by investigating how recent advances in exact solution algorithms for linear and mixed-integer programs over the rational numbers can be applied to analyze and tackle the numerical difficulties arising in wireless network design models.

Uncertainties in the form of randomness and fuzziness are handled together for a better reflection of the problem. Different risk measures such as "variability index", "downside risk" and "conditional value at risk" are integrated within the proposed model. Particularly, for the downside risk measure, target/threshold values are considered as fuzzy and described by their own possibility distribution. The proposed hybrid model is applied to an illustrative example inspired by the lead/acid industry in Turkey. Computational results of applying the different risk measures suggest that using downside risk model with fuzzy targets is found to be an appropriate choice for the stated closed-loop supply chain network design problem in terms of "computational efficiency", "handling uncertainty" and "solution quality" (C) 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

The principles and design characteristics of this application are over-viewed. The main difference of the requirements of this application compared to conventional CNN realizations is that in addition to linear, cells are also coupled with polynomial-type couplings. A mixed-mode CNN is shown to be suitable for the realization of a polynomial-type CNN in the brain electrical activity analysis application. In a mixed-mode CNN multiplication is done in analog domain, whereas the integration and storage are digital. Suitability of different integration methods for cell level realization are studied and cell and network level design of a mixed-mode CNN is described. First-, second- and third-order polynomial feedback terms are included in the cell and Heun's integration method is used. In order to reduce the cell count, the array is designed so that it can process input data that has been divided into blocks. The whole input data is stored in parallel with the cells so that all input/output operations during processing are local. Cell structure is shown along with register connections between edge cells of the network. Analog power consumption and computing speed are estimated by HSPICE simulations using 0.25 mum digital CMOS process parameters. The die area of a network with 2 x 72 cells with 36 layers in each was determined by drawing the layout. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

We consider both static and dynamic traffic scenarios and aim to provide 100% restoration against single-link failures while minimizing the total energy-cost on regenerators. For static traffic scenarios, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to solve the energy-efficient p-cycle design for translucent optical networks with MRP. The ILP model optimizes the allocation of working and protection resources jointly under the quality of transmission constraint, with the objective to minimize the total energy cost. A heuristic that can sequentially optimize the p-cycle designs for connections is proposed afterward. We use simulations to evaluate the performance of the algorithms with both uniform and nonuniform traffic models. For dynamic traffic scenarios, we design an algorithm that can handle the setting-up and tearing-down of p-cycles dynamically, according to the time-variant connections. We enhance this algorithmby introducing a reoptimization procedure, which can reassemble existing p-cycles for higher energy efficiency. An ILP model is formulated and solved for the p-cycle reoptimization. We then consider two reoptimization scenarios: (1) on demand (p-cycle-oDRO) and (2) on schedule (p-cycle-oSRO). In addition to the link-based p-cycle, we also study the path-based shared backup path protection scheme.

If the concatenated data of task blocks extracted from the block-design paradigm could provide equivalent FC information to that derived from continuous task data, it would shorten the data collection time and simplify experimental procedures, and the already collected data of block-design paradigms could be reanalyzed from the perspective of FC. Despite being used in many studies, such a hypothesis of equivalence has not yet been tested from multiple perspectives. In this study, we collected fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals from 24 healthy subjects during a continuous task session as well as in block-design task sessions. We compared concatenated task blocks and continuous task data in terms of region of interest-(ROI-) based FC, seed-based FC, and brain network topology during a short motor task. According to our results, the concatenated data was not significantly different from the continuous data in multiple aspects, indicating the potential of using concatenated data to estimate task-state FC in short motor tasks. However, even under appropriate experimental conditions, the interpretation of FC results based on concatenated data should be cautious and take the influence due to inherent information loss during concatenation into account.

A novel converse Lyapunov Lemma is also developed to prove the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the proposed observer. Applicability of the presented scheme is verified by simulation.

Aiming at the overall optimization of the layout of the star-tree ground gathering and transportation pipe network, this paper constructs a special mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) mathematical model considering the station capacity allocation problem, which can simultaneously obtain the optimal pipe network topology, pipe connection relationship, station location and quantity, station type, central station [central processing plant (CPP)] location and investment of each part. Numerical analysis of gas fields of different scales is used to discuss the influence of station capacity allocation and different station capacity combinations on the optimization of pipe network layout. The optimization effect of star-tree and star-star pipe network layout is compared and analyzed. The results not only prove the correctness and effectiveness of the model and algorithm proposed in this paper but also reduce the total investment of the pipe network. It can be seen that the optimization scheme has guiding significance for the surface engineering construction of the oil and gas fields.

We consider a two-stage protocol: At the first stage, two terminals simultaneously transmit data packets towards a relaying node. The relay maps the received signal into a discrete constellation using appropriate network coding, after which it is broadcasted to the terminals at the second stage. In our previous work, it has been revealed that network coding should be adaptively changed according to the channel state information, and unconventional signalling such as 5QAM can improve throughput for some channel conditions. In this paper, our design method of network coding is improved for the case of frequency-selective fading channels.					Koike-Akino, Toshiaki/T-2062-2019; Poor, H.

Continuous operation modes are used to expand the impedance design space. In the input and output matching networks, harmonic control circuits are set up to improve efficiency. The load harmonic impedances are obtained by continuous theory. Bias network and harmonic short circuit are used in the input matching network to control harmonics and obtain stop-band. Dynamic drain bias enables the PA to adapt to different emission environments. With input and output harmonic control technology, a 0.9, 1.5, and 2.1 GHz GaN PA is designed to achieve high efficiency in different modes. The measured efficiencies of the fabricated PA at all three bands are more than 58.6%.

This study introduces a continuous approximation model to facilitate the design of a seaport-dry-port network that takes carbon emissions into account. Multimodal transport with two transport modes: rail and road are considered. Containers are delivered quickly from shippers to dry ports through road transport; then transferred to seaport through rail transport to save money and reduce carbon emission. For decision-making scheme, a game theory is used to help the seaport, dry ports, and shippers optimize their own benefits and guide them to determine their decision variables. A nonlinear optimization technique is used to solve this seaport-dry port network design problem. The closed-form of all decision variables is found directly. A numerical study is conducted to derive managerial insights. The results show that the development of dry port concepts and multimodal transports could reduce the carbon cost from road transport.

Medium setting bitumen emulsion pre-coated aggregates and filler were used for WMA samples at varying mixing temperature, using bitumen in a two-stage process. Type and amount of filler, mixing temperature, and optimum bitumen to emulsion ratio is determined based upon the design MPs. ANN model with one input layer and two hidden layers with five neurons each, and one output layer with a single neuron, is developed for predicting WMA design parameters. Coarse aggregate%, fine aggregate%, filler %, bitumen to emulsion ratio, and bitumen content, are used as input for predicting WMA MPs 'stability,' 'flow,' and 'air voids' as outputs using Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm.

Pulse wave transmission time has been widely used for continuous BP prediction. However, because of the limitation of the linear model and the complexity of signal acquisition traditional method is often troubled with low BP prediction accuracy. In this paper, Elman neural networks (Elmans) are used to construct the continuous blood pressure measurement model. Continuous measurement of blood pressure is achieved by a single channel pulse signal (PPG). Based on the timerelated features of Elman, we apply a method using the feature input matrix by the pulse wave feature points at time t-1 and time t. We select the SBP and DBP at time t as the output matrix of the model; finally establish the Elman continuous blood pressure measurement model. Twenty physiological data segments of two hours selected from the MIMIC II database are used to evaluate the performance. Compared with straightforward use of the PWTT-based linear regression model and the back propagation neural network model, the proposed model achieves higher measurement accuracy.																					978-1-5090-3944-9				2017							2008	2013																WOS:000435276600390

The communication limitation is that only one transmission node can get access to the shared communication channel at each time step, and that different transmission nodes in the networked systems are scheduled to transmit information according to a Markov protocol. Then the remote estimator completes the estimation with only partially available observations, which are quantified. Suppose that the Markov chain is unknown to the remote estimator. By using orthogonal projection principle and innovation analysis method, a Kalman type filter is designed in a recurrence form. It is shown that estimation performance depends on the transition probability matrix of the Markov chain, quantization error, and the shared channel weighting parameter. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Feedback linearization for such systems leads to the output dynamics nonlinear dependence on the system states, the control input, and uncertain parameters, which leads to the nonlinear parametrization problem, the implicit relative degree problem, and the difficulty to specify an analytical adaptive controller. To address these problems, we first develop a new adaptive parameter estimation strategy to deal with all uncertain parameters, especially, those of nonlinearly parameterized forms, in the output dynamics. Then, we construct a key implicit function equation using available signals and parameter estimates. By solving the equation, a unique adaptive control law is derived to ensure asymptotic output tracking and closed-loop stability. Alternatively, we design an iterative solution-based adaptive control law which is easy to implement and ensure output tracking and closed-loop stability. The simulation study is given to demonstrate the design procedure and verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive control scheme.					chen, mou/KOC-4929-2024; Zhang, Yanjun/H-9057-2019	Zhang, Yanjun/0000-0002-1036-8568; Tao, Gang/0000-0003-4946-5071													2168-2267	2168-2275				DEC	2021	51	12					5728	5739		10.1109/TCYB.2019.2958844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2019.2958844								31940572					WOS:000733232400012

Travis			Robust dynamic continuous network design problem	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												A robust optimization model is presented for the dynamic traffic assignment-based continuous network design problem, which accounts for a bilevel objective and long-term origin-destination demand uncertainty. The model also embeds Daganzo's cell transmission model. The objective minimizes the trade-off between expected total system travel time (TSTT) and expected risk. As such, the robust model provides the optimal solution that is least sensitive to the variation of travel demand, given the degree of robustness by transportation planners. The new robust model is compared with the existing network design models on a simple cell transmission test network. The robust model with greater degree of robustness yields less expected risk with the sacrifice of higher expected TSTT. The robust model yields the most robust solution, and no other model provides a satisfactory solution across the budget range. In addition, how a visualized graph may be used to elicit the preference information from transportation planners on the desired degree of robustness is illustrated.

First, a logical zero-order-hold is introduced to select the newest data packets to drive the plant, with which network-induced delays and data packet dropouts can be expressed explicitly. Second, an auxiliary vector-valued function is introduced to establish a novel finite-sum inequality, which can provide a tighter bound than some existing ones for some finite-sum term. Third, this finite-sum inequality is employed to formulate a stability criterion for the closed-loop system under consideration. It is proven that the stability criterion is of less conservatism than some existing ones reported in the literature. Fourth, a cone-complementary-linearization-based algorithm is presented to design suitable output feedback controllers.

One of the critical issues in the network design process is the topological design problem involved in establishing a centralized data communication network with best performance and low costs. It can be recognized as a degree-constrained minimum spanning tree and it has been shown to be NP-hard. The degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem commonly appears as a subproblem in the design of centralized data communication networks, and so the development of effective algorithms has received much attention in the research literature. To achieve effectiveness in solving degree-constrained minimum spanning tree, a solution algorithm based on cross-decomposition is proposed in this paper. The computational results are analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It shows a great promise in the design of centralized data communication networks.

Thus, the design of an optimal-cost HEN is a challenging research topic in recently decade. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) stage-wise model by commercial optimization software; GAMS, is developed and allow any split stream flow through multiple exchangers in series as well as bypass stage before mixing non-isothermally for simultaneous synthesis. In the MINLP model where multiple local optima may present, the initialization strategy is therefore developed to systematically find feasible starting point resulting in better HEN design compared to published results in the literatures. In addition, the retrofit of HENs is obtained by adding retrofit constraints to HENS model.																			1974-9791		978-88-95608-34-1				2015	43						1273	1278		10.3303/CET1543213	http://dx.doi.org/10.3303/CET1543213													WOS:000365994200213

In this paper, we first introduce a so-called group policy that achieves a virtual topology with maximum connectivity and simplifies the optimal design of a traffic sensitive virtual topology. We propose a two-stage algorithm: a node-to-group assignment and a wavelength-to-group assignment. The results show that the proposed algorithm is a practical tool that efficiently reconfigures the connectivity diagram to fit best the current traffic pattern.																			0146-8030						1995	14	1					53	69		10.1080/01468039508240545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01468039508240545													WOS:A1995QJ41000005

In 3LIHON, three service levels, namely guaranteed transparent service, real time statistically multiplexed packet service, and best effort basic Internet service are considered. The proposed mechanism is designed to meet Quality-of-Service requirements in future Internet scenarios, when mixing these traffic classes on a generic output node interface. Delay and loss performance obtained with this mechanism are evaluated by asynchronous simulation. Insights in reciprocal influence of traffic integrated on the same interface are reported and discussed for different sample hybrid traffic mixes. In particular loss for real-time traffic can be kept under reasonable values with a proper traffic dimensioning. Furthermore, delays for the best effort class are negligible compared to aggregation and propagation delays. The novel results obtained can be applied to support switch design and quality traffic engineering in hybrid networking.					raffaelli, carla/AAA-5530-2020	raffaelli, carla/0000-0002-1250-2476															978-1-4673-1391-9; 978-1-4673-4491-3				2012																								WOS:000316953300048

Similar to a conventional graph, which consists of a set of edges, a hypergraph consists of a set of hyperedges (or hyperchannels), each of which can connect two or more nodes and can support communications amongst the nodes inside the hyperchannel. To enable hyperchannel in optical SMART networks, we have designed a hybrid node architecture in our previous study [1]. In this paper, we explore the network design principles and formulation for optical SMART networks. In particular, we formulate the static hyperchannel establishment problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), where the set of possible hyperchannels is given.

This paper establishes a model of agri-food supply chain network. This model includes material suppliers, agricultural producers, distributors, and customers. Different from previous studies, this paper designs a supply chain network based on risks. The risks come from the fuzzy environment. The purpose of design is to minimize the risks of total cost of agri-food supply chain network. The total cost is composed of variable cost, transportation cost, and fixed cost. This model is a non-deterministic polynomial problem and a mixed integer nonlinear programming model. In general, it is difficult to solve. But this model can be handled by Cplex12.6.

The event-based estimator receives the updated measurements from the sensors only when the prespecified event-triggering rule is violated. Compared with the traditional estimator with the clock driven rule, a series of event-based state estimators are developed so as to reduce unnecessary data transmissions in the communication channel. Attention is focused on the analysis and design problem of the event-based estimators for the addressed discrete-time complex networks such that the estimation error is exponentially bounded in mean square. Some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the existence of the desired estimators and the upper bound of the estimation error is derived. By using the convex optimization technique, the gain parameters of the desired estimators are obtained in an explicit form. Finally, a numerical example is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed estimation approach.

The distribution network constitutes of reliable distribution centers are more expensive, always available and not affected by disruption, and unreliable distribution centers. Thus, they might be fortified at any level of reliability. Several numerical examples with sensitivity analyses are conducted to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model.

Modern 4th generation and 5th generation district heating networks can be used to integrate sources of waste heat, which allows efficient operation. The design of such heating networks is subject of many optimization models. Most optimization models focus on energy flows and result in Mixed Integer Linear Programs. This requires simplifications, where temperatures and mass flow rates are neglected or simplified. This work presents a Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Program with temperature constraints. A case study is presented, where the integration of low temperature waste heat in a district heating network is optimized. In this case study the positioning of heat pumps at the supply or at the consumers influences network operation. The results show a trade-off between economical and ecological optimal solutions with a range of total annualized costs from 120,000 EUR/a to 307,000 EUR/a and a range of CO2-Emissions from 193 t/a to 605 t/a. Furthermore, the influence of design decisions on the optimal operation is demonstrated. All in all, the quadratic model formulation stresses the influence of temperatures on the optimization outcome and offers pareto optimal solutions for the design of the presented case study.

The proposed versatile circuit allows for adjustable cell dynamical characteristics, controlled by design parameters, while the discrete element approach enables simple on-board implementation without the need for large-scale integration, which is necessary for testing hardware with individual fabricated memristors. A voltage-mode approach, that makes use of the diversity of operational amplifiers, is preferred here over a current-mode one that necessitates a large number of individual transistors. The dynamical properties of the system are initially investigated through the calculation of equilibrium points and further illustrated applying the concept of State Dynamic Routes (SDRs) for the cell assuming that the memristor dynamics are much slower than the capacitor voltage dynamics. Moreover, the effect of design parameters on the cell dynamics is being investigated, showing how the scaling of the operating voltage, as well as a plethora of CNN variants -i.e., the ChuaYang and Full Range models-, can be implemented within the same design. Finally, the nonlinear conductance properties of real memristor devices are incorporated into the study, demonstrating interesting bifurcation phenomena between the cell monostability and bistability for specific parameter values.

To maximise the utilisation of network resources by reducing unnecessary data transmissions, a dynamic event-triggered rule is properly presented. Assuming that the system might be attacked by two kinds of stochastic cyber-attacks, which are governed by two different functions. The asynchronous fact between the modes of the system and controller is described by the hidden Markov model. The criterion of stochastically admissible with a certain passive performance is established.

An NCS with STVD is transformed into a time-varying discrete time system. And then, this discrete time system is converted into a equivalent time-invariant system with norm-bounded uncertainties by using robust control techniques. Using this method, the conservatism of the stability condition caused by STVD can be reduced. Based on that, a single norm-bounded uncertainty is replaced by N norm-bounded uncertainties to further reduce conservatism. Theoretical analysis shows that when N is increased, the stability condition becomes less conservative. For a fixed sampling period, the obtained stability conditions explicitly depend on the upper and lower bounds of the time delay. The existence condition and design method for the controllers are also presented. Finally, three numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

However, limited by factors such as imaging hardware, scanning time, and cost, it is challenging to acquire high-resolution MR images clinically. In this article, fine perceptive generative adversarial networks (FP-GANs) are proposed to produce super-resolution (SR) MR images from the low-resolution counterparts. By adopting the divide-and-conquer scheme, FP-GANs are designed to deal with the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components of MR images separately and parallelly. Specifically, FP-GANs first decompose an MR image into LF global approximation and HF anatomical texture subbands in the wavelet domain. Then, each subband generative adversarial network (GAN) simultaneously concentrates on super-resolving the corresponding subband image. In generator, multiple residual-in-residual dense blocks are introduced for better feature extraction. In addition, the texture-enhancing module is designed to trade off the weight between global topology and detailed textures. Finally, the reconstruction of the whole image is considered by integrating inverse discrete wavelet transformation in FP-GANs. Comprehensive experiments on the MultiRes_7T and ADNI datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves finer structure recovery and outperforms the competing methods quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, FP-GANs further show the value by applying the SR results in classification tasks.

Humanitarian logistics network design under mixed uncertainty	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												In this paper, we address a two-echelon humanitarian logistics network design problem involving multiple central warehouses (CWs) and local distribution centers (LDCs) and develop a novel two-stage scenario based possibilistic-stochastic programming (SBPSP) approach. The research is motivated by the urgent need for designing a relief network in Tehran in preparation for potential earthquakes to cope with the main logistical problems in pre- and post-disaster phases. During the first stage, the locations for CWs and LDCs are determined along with the prepositioned inventory levels for the relief supplies. In this stage, inherent uncertainties in both supply and demand data as well as the availability level of the transportation network's routes after an earthquake are taken into account. In the second stage, a relief distribution plan is developed based on various disaster scenarios aiming to minimize: total distribution time, the maximum weighted distribution time for the critical items, total cost of unused inventories and weighted shortage cost of unmet demands. A tailored differential evolution (DE) algorithm is developed to find good enough feasible solutions within a reasonable CPU time. Computational results using real data reveal promising performance of the proposed SBPSP model in comparison with the existing relief network in Tehran. The paper contributes to the literature on optimization based design of relief networks under mixed possibilistic-stochastic uncertainty and supports informed decision making by local authorities in increasing resilience of urban areas to natural disasters.

The objective is to determine the optimal frequency of a multimodal transit network, which minimizes total users' travel cost and operation cost of transit lines. The problem is formulated as a bilevel programming problem with equilibrium constraints describing noncooperative Nash equilibrium in a dynamic simulation-based transit assignment context. A hybrid algorithm combing the cross entropy multiagent learning algorithm and Hooke-Jeeves algorithm is proposed. Computational results are provided on a small network to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

J	Li, J; Zhang, YN; Mao, MZ				Li, Jian; Zhang, Yunong; Mao, Mingzhi			Five-instant type discrete-time ZND solving discrete time-varying linear system, division and quadratic programming	NEUROCOMPUTING												Discrete time-varying linear system (LS) is a fundamental topic in science and engineering. However, conventional methods essentially designed for time-invariant LS generally assume that LS is time-invariant during a small time interval (i.e., sampling gap) for solving time-varying LS. This assumption quite limits their precision because of the existing of lagging errors. Discarding this assumption, Zhang neural dynamics (ZND) method improves the precision for LS solving, which is a great alternative for the solving of discrete time-varying problems. Note that precision solutions to discrete time-varying problems depend on discretization formulas. In this paper, we propose a new ZND model to solve the discrete time-varying LS. The discrete time-varying division is a special case of discrete time-varying LS with the solution being a scalar while it is usually studied alone. Considering the above inner connection, we further propose a special model for solving the discrete time-varying division. Moreover, as an application of discrete time-varying LS, the discrete time-varying quadratic programming (QP) subject to LS is also studied. The convergence and precision of proposed models are guaranteed by theoretical analyses and substantiated by numerous numerical experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, FH; Zeng, ZG				Zhang, Fanghai; Zeng, Zhigang			Multiple ψ-Type Stability of Cohen-Grossberg Neural Networks With Both Time-Varying Discrete Delays and Distributed Delays	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												In this paper, multiple psi-type stability of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks (CGNNs) with both timevarying discrete delays and distributed delays is investigated. By utilizing psi-type functions combined with a new psi-type integral inequality for treating distributed delay terms, some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that multiple equilibrium points are psi-type stable for CGNNs with discrete and distributed delays, where the distributed delays include bounded and unbounded delays. These conditions of CGNNs with different output functions are less restrictive. More specifically, the algebraic criteria of the generalized model are applicable to several well-known neural network models by taking special parameters, and multiple different output functions are introduced to replace some of the same output functions, which improves the diversity of output results for the design of neural networks. In addition, the estimation of relative convergence rate of psi-type stability is determined by the parameters of CGNNs and the selection of psi-type functions. As a result, the existing results on multistability and monostability can be improved and extended. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

Firstly, we establish a novel neutral type neural network synchronization error model by employing an improved delayed feedback controller instead of the traditional one. Moreover, despite of the discrete time-delay, the distributed time-delay, the external disturbance and the uncertain parameters are involved in the design of our synchronization model. Secondly, with the aid of proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), some sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of synchronization error system are derived and the gain of the controller is obtained by using linear matrix inequality (LMI) and proper integral term estimation methods. Finally, we use Euler-Maruyama numerical mechanism to simulate the drive-response systems and the error system, which shows the good convergence performance of our synchronization model. A numerical example in the end of the paper shows the effectiveness of our proposed method.																			1370-4621	1573-773X				OCT	2023	55	5			SI		5539	5554		10.1007/s11063-022-11098-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-022-11098-9		JAN 2023											WOS:000951853300001

We use deep belief networks (DBNs). DBNs, which due to their multiple layers with feature detectors at the lower layers and a supervised scheme at the higher layers, can provide nonlinear mappings. The mapping mechanism works by considering simulation constructs, hardware, and software intricacies such as simulation objects, concurrency, iterations, routines, and messaging rates with a particular importance level based on a cognitive approach. The result of the mapping is a synchronization scheme such as breathing time buckets, breathing time warp, and time warp to optimize speedup. The simulation-optimization technique outlined in this research study is unique. This new methodology could be realized within the current parallel and distributed simulation modeling systems to enhance performance.

Marshal			Robust state estimation for discrete-time BAM neural networks with time-varying delay	NEUROCOMPUTING												This paper is concerned with the robust delay-dependent state estimation problem for a class of discrete-time Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) neural networks with time-varying delays. By using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional together with linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a new set of sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of state estimator such that the error state system is asymptotically stable. More precisely, an LMI-based state estimator and delay-dependent stability criterion for delayed BAM neural networks are developed. The conditions are established in terms of LMIs which can be solved by the MATLAB LMI toolbox. It should be mentioned that all the sufficient conditions are dependent on the upper and lower bounds' of the delays. Also, the desired estimator unknown gain matrix is determined in terms of the solution to these LMIs. Finally, numerical examples with simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A logistics service provider seeks a repeatable plan to transport commodities from distribution centers on the periphery to inner-city satellites. In a hetero-geneous infrastructure, autonomous vehicles in level 4 may only drive in feasible streets but need to be pulled elsewhere by manually operated vehicles in platoons. We formulate an integer program to determine the fleet mix, schedule transportation services, and decide on the routing or outsourcing of commodities. Platooning requires a high level of synchronization between vehicles which demands the time-expanded networks to contain narrow time intervals. Thus, we develop an algorithm based on the dynamic discretization discovery scheme which refines partially time-expanded networks iteratively without having to enumerate the fully time-expanded network a priori. We introduce valid inequalities and provide two enhanced versions of the algorithm that exploit linear relaxations of the problem. Further, we propose heuristic ideas to speed up the search for high-quality solutions. In a computational study, we analyze the efficacy of the algorithm in different versions and observe improvements of computational performance in comparison to a commercial solver. Finally, we solve a case study on a real-world based network to obtain insights into the deployment of a mixed autonomous fleet in an existing heterogeneous infrastructure. (C) 2020 The Authors.

First, the H-infinity performance of the synchronization error dynamical system between the drive unified model and the response one is analyzed using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Second, the novel state feedback controllers are established to guarantee H-infinity performance for the overall system. The parameters of these controllers are determined by solving the eigenvalue problem (EVP). Most discrete-time chaotic systems with or without time delays can be converted into this unified model, and H-infinity synchronization controllers are designed in a unified way.

Transmitted through a network under an event-triggered scheme, the sample outputs of the plant are used to drive the dynamical output feedback controller to generate a new control signal in the discrete-time domain. The discrete-time control signals are also transmitted through the network to drive the plant. As a result of two types of transmission delays, the controlled plant and the dynamical output feedback controller are driven by the discrete-time outputs and control signals at different instants of time. An interval decomposition method is introduced to place the controlled plant and the output feedback controller into the same updated time interval but with updated signals at different instants. Based on a proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure H-infinity performance for the controlled plant.

Compound 2 is a discrete binuclear copper (II) complex. The geometry around the metal centre is a distorted square pyramid. Compound 3, in contrast, is an infinite coordination network formed upon mutual bridging of binuclear species through chloride atoms. Again, the geometry around each copper atom is closed to a square pyramid. The packing of the 1-D coordination networks generates channels which are occupied by BF4- anions. The magnetic behaviour observed for the 1-D network is comparable to the one corresponding to a discrete chloro-bridged copper (II) binuclear complex. In terms of magnetic coupling, whereas a strong ferromagnetic coupling is observed between the two spin bearers within the dimer (d = 3.467 Angstrom) (J/k(B) = 337 K), a weak interdimer antiferromagnetic interaction is measured (zJ'/k(B) = -1.6 K).

Generally proxy servers are used to hold the frequently requested objects so as to reduce the network traffic to the central server but most of them are designed for text and image data. In this paper, we propose a two-layered network cache management policy for continuous media object delivery over the Internet. With the proposed cache management scheme, in each LAN, there exists one LAN cache and each LAN is further divided into a group of sub-LANs, each of which has its own sub-LAN cache. Each object is also partitioned into two parts: the front-end and rear-end partition. They can be loaded in the same cache or separately in different network caches according to their access frequencies. By doing so, cache replacement overhead could be reduced as compared to the case of the full size data allocation and replacement; this eventually reduces the backbone network traffic to the origin server.																			0730-3157		0-7695-0792-1				2000	24						389	394																WOS:000165736000069

Unsteady advection-diffusion simulations in complex Discrete Fracture Networks with an optimization approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												It is widely recognized that the prediction of transport of contaminants in a fractured rock mass requires models that preserve several distinctive features of the inner fracture network, like heterogeneity and directionality; in this respect, Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) play a significant role. The solution of the associated equations would claim a high computational demand, that could be met only by using agile and robust numerical techniques. In this note a new numerical technique, fully validated from a mathematical standpoint, is applied to engineering problems, also introducing dispersion models for the description of non-stationary transport phenomena. The method results in a fast and scalable resolution tool, based on a PDE-constrained optimization approach designed to avoid mesh generation problems and allowing for transport simulations with an Eulerian approach.

The authors designed and analyzed a variety of network area cutting methods: rectangular cutting, square cutting, concentric circle cutting, sector cutting, and mixed cutting. Through simulation experiments, the difference between the survival time and the number of received packets is compared. The experimental results show that mixed cutting can calculate the expected energy consumption according to the energy consumption rate, and then allocate chargers according to the expected energy consumption, making the energy consumption burden of each charger more equitable. Compared with other partition methods, the load capacity distribution of each charger is more uniform. In terms of survival time and receiving message packets, the network can have a longer survival time, receive more message packets, and use the power consumption of each block more evenly and effectively.						zuoli, Zhang/0000-0001-6506-867X													1938-0259	1938-0267					2022	14	1								10.4018/IJGHPC.316155	http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/IJGHPC.316155													WOS:000916579600003

However, the formation of these networks has an inherent difficulty in homogeneous mixing of mutually reactive building blocks, leading to the formation of inhomogeneous network structures. Recently, we have designed and fabricated the Tetra-PEG gel by combining two well-defined symmetrical tetra-arm polymers of the same size. Although this gel was formed by simply mixing two polymer solutions, the structure was extremely homogeneous. In this study, we investigated the gelation kinetics of Tetra-PEG gel in detail. The reaction kinetics corresponded well with the theoretical prediction, suggesting the homogeneous reacting system. This homogeneous reacting system may contribute to the homogeneous network structure of Tetra-PEG gel.

Thus we established a discrete-time jump system model with Markov delay. Based on this, this paper gave also initial feasible solution of interior-point algorithm to design stabilizing controllers by the optimization method.

Sparse signal reconstruction can be converted into an L-1-minimization problem, which can also be changed into the unconstrained basis pursuit denoising problem. To solve the L-1-minimization problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed based on the discrete-time projection neural network, and the global convergence of the algorithm is analyzed by using Lyapunov method. Experiments on sparse signal reconstruction and several popular face data sets are organized to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is not only robust to different levels of sparsity and amplitude of signals and the noise pixels but also insensitive to the diverse values of scalar weight. Moreover, the value of the step size of the proposed algorithm is close to 1/2, thus a fast convergence rate is potentially possible. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves better classification performance compared with some other algorithms for face recognition.

Employment of a multi-hop reverse path for acknowledgement delivery is the key concept in these designs. If the maximum reverse path length is allowed to take larger values then the number of usable unidirectional links increases. Increasing the number of available links leads to better energy balancing and longer network lifetime. But is it necessary to keep the reverse path length large to achieve maximum network lifetime possible? In this study, we investigate the effects of reverse path length in WSNs with unidirectional links induced by transmission power heterogeneity on network lifetime through a novel mixed integer programming (MIP) framework. Our results show that reverse path length has significant impact on WSN lifetime.					tavli, bulent/AEN-2252-2022; Tavli, Bulent/AAG-9523-2020; Batmaz, Anil Ufuk/ABE-7803-2021	tavli, bulent/0000-0002-9615-1983; Tavli, Bulent/0000-0002-9615-1983; Batmaz, Anil Ufuk/0000-0001-7948-8093													2165-0608		978-1-4673-5563-6; 978-1-4673-5562-9				2013																								WOS:000325005300420

Furthermore, due to the physical limitations of components, saturation often occurs in actuators. In view of these, we focus on the stabilization of networked control systems with noisy sampling intervals and actuators saturation. First, a closed-loop stochastic system model, whose system matrix is characterized by high nonlinearity and randomness, is obtained by considering the noisy sampling intervals and actuators saturation in a unified framework. In order to obtain a sufficient condition for the mean-square stability of resulting closed-loop discrete-time stochastic system with a prescribed H-infinity performance, the confluent Vandermonde matrix approach and Kronecker product operation are utilized in the mathematical expectation of a nonlinear and random coupling matrix, and then a saturated H-infinity controller is designed.

This paper provides a study of the transmission, modeling, and analysis of variable bit rate (VBR) video, which is fundamental for designing protocols and for effective utilization of networks in video transmission. To meet the specified requirements of future networks, the scalable video codec (SVC) was chosen as the video compression standard. The main objective of this work was to propose a statistical model that will allow better coordination between generated SVC video traffic and original video traffic. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing the model with three existing low-complex statistical models using graphical and statistical measurements as well as cross-validation. For all evaluation techniques, the accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated, and the frame size distribution of the modeled traffic was found to match that of the original video traffic better than other existing models.

Due to the difference in terms of communication technology and autonomous driving technology for HVs and CAVs, three types of intersections have been proposed to amplify the efficiency-improvement benefit from CAVs by separating CAVs from HVs in a temporal or local-spatial dimension: the conventional signalized intersection, the novel signalized intersection with a dedicated CAV phase and dedicated CAV approaches, and the intelligent signal-free intersection. The problem is to determine the spatial layout of different types of intersections in the transportation network, the cycle time, and green time duration for each phase of signalized intersections that minimize the total travel cost, in which the route choice behavior of heterogeneous travelers has been respected based on the user equilibrium principle. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed to formulate the proposed intersection design and signal setting problem based on the link-node modeling method, in which the path enumeration is avoided. Then, by employing various linearization techniques (e.g., disjunctive constraints, logarithmic transformation, piecewise linearization with logarithmic-sized binary variables and constraints, outer-approximation technique), the proposed model can be further transformed into a relaxed sub-problem in the form of mixed-integer linear programming. A globally optimal solution algorithm embedding with solving a sequence of relaxed sub-problems and nonlinear mixed complementarity problems is proposed to converge to a global optimum. The results of numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed methodology can significantly improve the performance of the whole network. Moreover, it consistently outperforms the optimization model considering only conventional signalized intersections under various CAV market penetration rates.

To communicate data among its various components, sonars used a mix of nonstandard, custom technologies many of which posed reliability, maintainability and expandability problems. Gigabit Ethernet which refers to various technologies to transfer Ethernet frames (as defined by IEEE standard) has emerged as a mature communication technology for use in defence systems due to standardization of components and protocols used. This paper presents a design of a network for submarine sonar systems primarily based on Gigabit Ethernet. Various design aspects are presented along with new network-based applications to meet sonar functionalities.																			2326-5558		978-93-80095-45-5				2013							238	245																WOS:000349632700033
J	Lei, M; Zhang, XJ; Yu, BC; Dong, XS				Lei, Ming; Zhang, Xingjun; Yu, Bocheng; Dong, Xiaoshe			Power and discrete rate adaptation in BER constrained wireless powered communication networks	IET COMMUNICATIONS												Optimal system throughput is a crucial design issue in wireless powered communication networks. Unlike related literature, this study considers the problem of maximising throughput (MTP) for a practical scenario, in which each user node (UN) selects its own rate from a discrete rate set and controls its transmission power according to its own channel state. The MTP with a bit-error-rate constraint is investigated based on two general uplink access methods. The formulation size is exponentially large with respect to the problem input. A novel greedy algorithm based on the column generation method (GA-CGM) is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The GA-CGM decomposes the problem into a master problem and a subproblem. The master problem is solved by the simplex method. The subproblem is solved by a greedy algorithm due to its non-linearity programming model. The max-min throughput problem (MMTP) is also considered, because of the doubly near-far' phenomenon which leads to the unfair throughput among different UNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solutions are close to the optimal solutions for MTP and MMTP problems. They also show increasing the transmission power of a base station or decreasing the path-loss exponent improves the throughput performance.

This issue can be happened because maritime transport infrastructure in Indonesia have not served effectively yet,. Therefore, the provider of shipping services should be able to design the Indonesian maritime logistics network that best suits with the current maritime conditions and provide the greatest benefits. This study aims to obtain a model of decision-making at all levels (strategic, tactical, operational) to determine the type of vessel, the shipping routes, and cargo allocation that gives the maximum profit.

The proposed joint design enables the coexistence of multiple wireless links at the same channel, resulting in an enhanced spectral efficiency. Moreover, it enables the usage of FD capability when/where it is gainful. In this regard, a mixed-integer linear program is proposed, aiming at a minimum-cost design for the wireless backhaul network, considering the required rate demand at each base station. Moreover, a retuning algorithm is proposed, which reacts to the slight changes in the network condition, e.g., channel attenuation or rate demand, by adjusting the transmit power at the wireless links. In this regard, a successive-inner-approximation-based design is proposed, where, in each step, a convex subproblem is solved. Numerical simulations show a reduction in the overall network cost via the utilization of the proposed designs, thanks to the coexistence of multiple wireless links on the same channel due to the FD capability.

This design aims to maximize the min rate achieved by ground users (GUs) subject to their data transmission demands. To tackle the underlying mixed integer non-linear optimization problem, we use the alternating optimization approach where we iteratively optimize the sub-channel assignment and UAV trajectory control until convergence. Toward this end, we propose a heuristic algorithm to obtain a feasible solution for the sub-channel assignment sub-problem. In addition, the successive convex approximation (SCA) method is used to convexify and solve the non-convex UAV trajectory control sub-problem.

Design of an efficiency enhanced wideband Doherty power amplifier based on synthesising of a modified harmonic-control load modulation network	IET MICROWAVES ANTENNAS & PROPAGATION												A design of a broadband Doherty power amplifier (DPA) using a novel harmonic control network (HCN) is presented. The DPA structure focused on manipulating harmonic components using this new HCN to enhance the bandwidth of operation and power efficiency. The proposed HCN combines a third harmonic suppression network (THSN) with the second harmonic impedance inverter circuit (SHIIC). In the design, the second harmonic component of the main transistor and the peaking transistor are short-circuited by their associated SHIIC. Additionally, the carefully designed SHIIC and THSN circuit placed between the main and peaking transistors realise open circuit conditions at the third harmonic for both transistors at the saturation state and back-off regions. Side by side with the aid of the properly designed post-matching tuned network (PMTN), these harmonic loading conditions make both amplifiers to operate in continuous Class-F modes with enhanced-added efficiencies over wideband conditions. As a result, a succession of highly efficient DPA modes can be formed over a continuous frequency range in the full Doherty region, resulting in a reduced-size enhanced power efficiency wideband DPA. For verification, a wideband DPA operating from 1.1 to 1.8 GHz was designed and implemented using the proposed topology. The measured drain efficiency of the implemented DPA at 6-dB back-off is 52.5%-67.5%, while the saturated power across the specified bandwidth is 43-43.7 dBm. The fabricated DPA exhibits an average efficiency of 48.7%-59.4%, when supplied by a 40-MHz long-term evolution (LTE) signal with a 7.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Performing digital pre-distortion (DPD) improves the adjacent channel power ratio (ACLR) from -25.8 dBc to -47.6 dBc. A novel broadband DPA with a modified harmonic-control load-modulation network is presented. The proposed Doherty amplifier design focuses on manipulating the harmonic content of the DPA architecture to enhance bandwidth and efficiency. The modified HCN combines a third harmonic suppression network (THSN) with the second harmonic impedance inverter circuit (SHIIC). Side by side with the aid of the properly designed post-matching tuned network (PMTN), these harmonic loading conditions make both amplifiers operate in continuous Class-F modes with enhanced-added efficiencies over wideband conditions. As a result, a succession of highly efficient DPA modes can be formed over a continuous frequency range in the full Doherty region, resulting in a reduced-size enhanced power efficiency wideband DPA. A full synthesising of the modified harmonic control modulation network is provided in the paper to clarify the design criteria of the second/third harmonic manipulating network while preserving the fundamental frequency load modulation to improve the bandwidth and efficiency of the designed DPA. image					Abounemra, Ahmed/AAF-8644-2021	Abounemra, Ahmed/0000-0002-7089-4674													1751-8725	1751-8733				MAY	2024	18	5					356	368		10.1049/mia2.12464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/mia2.12464		FEB 2024											WOS:001164007200001

To address this problem, a cluster-based cooperative framework was presented in this paper. In this framework, all the candidate relays are divided into two clusters: relays near to the source (called source cluster) and nodes near to the destination (named as destination cluster). Further, to improve the performance, an algorithm for the efficient image transmission methodology was presented. Generally, in image transmission, Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) is widely used for image compression. Since the DWT is a convolution-based approach, designing the hardware circuit for floating-point numbers is difficult. Here, we adopt lifting based discrete wavelet transform to reduce the hardware implementation complexity for the compression. Through the simulation results, we show the performance improvement of the proposed method against state-of-art approaches in terms of peak signal to noise ratio, mean square error, structural similarity index and bit error rate.

RHs have recently attracted greater attention, as a major investment of decentralised manufacturing and service operations. The goal of this work is thus to develop a comprehensive framework to enable optimal design and administration of interconnected, collaborative, and networked manufacturing and service systems. The decisions include optimal design of (1) RH networks based on multiple indicators, and (2) collaboration mechanisms between the RHs. Cyber-supported communication technologies enable the RHs to collaboratively process their electronic tasks (e-Tasks), such that the overall service level, resource utilisation and stability are improved. A bi-objective mixed integer programming model is developed for modelling the RH network design and administration problem. Data envelopment analysis is applied for combining multiple RH network design indicators into unified preference scores. Due to the computational complexity of the problem, a memetic algorithm is developed with a local search mechanism for making task sharing decisions. Several numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate, analyse and highlight the unique features and implications of the developed methodology.

This new mote was designed for the ExScal project which seeks to demonstrate a 10,000 node network capable of discriminating civilians, soldiers and vehicles, spread out over a 10km(2) area, with node lifetimes approaching 1,000 hours of continuous operation on two AA alkaline batteries. This application posed unique functional, usability, scalability, and robustness requirements which could not be met with existing hardware, and therefore motivated the design of a new platform. The detection and classification requirements are met using infrared, magnetic, and acoustic sensors. The infrared and acoustic sensors are designed for low-power continuous operation and include asynchronous processor wakeup circuitry. The usability and scalability requirements are met by minimizing the frequency and cost of human-in-the-loop operations during node deployment, activation, and verification through improvements in the user interface, packaging, and configurability of the platform. Recoverable retasking is addressed by using a grenade timer that periodically forces a system reset. The key contributions of this work are a specific design point and general design methods for building sensor network platforms to detect exceptional events.																					0-7803-9201-9				2005							497	502																WOS:000230452800070

The genetic algorithm was designed for solving transportation routes problem and selecting transportation modes, and the tabu search algorithm for facilities location. Empirical analysis showed the optimization programs for designing MHSEFN could be obtained by the model. Based on the model, adjusting the mode of transportation by lowest customer satisfaction could not only take the same good customer satisfaction, but also reduce transportation costs, which reflected the effectiveness of applying the customer satisfaction and MHSEFN for express freight system. It was more comprehensive and closer to reality, could provide theoretical reference for express enterprise's decision-making.					yang, xiang/HKN-0533-2023; Xiang, Yang/D-1280-2009; Xiang, Yang/M-3527-2019	Xiang, Yang/0000-0001-5252-0831; Xiang, Yang/0000-0001-5252-0831															978-1-4673-9026-2				2016							2481	2485																WOS:000411576804031

To solve this problem, a new graphical representation has been developed to characterize the minimum hydrogen requirement, and make a preliminary selection of the compatible purification units. From this preliminary analysis, a multi-objective optimisation method is applied in order to define the best hydrogen network and the proper integration of purification units. The proposed method decomposes the problem into two sub-problems : a mixed integer linear programming for network design at the lower level and an evolutionary algorithm strategy to solve the optimal design of the purification units at the upper level.

J	Zhang, D; Yu, L				Zhang, Dan; Yu, Li			Exponential state estimation for Markovian jumping neural networks with time-varying discrete and distributed delays	NEURAL NETWORKS												This paper is concerned with the exponential state estimation for Markovian jumping neural networks with time-varying discrete and distributed delays. The parameters of the neural networks are subject to the switching from one mode to another according to a Markov chain. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and developing a new convex combination technique, a new delay-dependent exponential stability condition is proposed, such that for all admissible delay bounds, the resulting estimation error system is mean-square exponentially stable with a prescribed noise attenuation level in the H, sense. It is also shown that the design of the desired state estimator is achieved by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The obtained condition implicitly establishes the relations among the maximum delay bounds, H-infinity noise attenuation level and the exponential decay rate of the estimation error system. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed result. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gabrel, V; Knippel, A; Minoux, M				Gabrel, V; Knippel, A; Minoux, M			A comparison of heuristics for the discrete cost multicommodity network optimization problem	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS												In this paper, approximate solutions algorithms for discrete cost multicommodity network optimization problems are presented and compared. Firstly, extensions of classical greedy heuristics, based on link-rerouting and flow-rerouting heuristics, are presented in details. Secondly, a new approximate solution algorithm, which basically consists of a heuristic implementation of the exact Benders-type cutting plane generation method, is proposed. All these algorithms are extensively compared on randomly generated graphs up to 50 nodes and 90 links. It clearly appears that this new Benders-type approach is very promising since it produces the best heuristic solutions.																			1381-1231					NOV	2003	9	5					429	445		10.1023/B:HEUR.0000004812.23590.a2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HEUR.0000004812.23590.a2													WOS:000186693100003
