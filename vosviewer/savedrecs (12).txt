Designing a reverse logistics network for optimal collection, recovery and quality-based product-mix planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS												This study proposes an integrated, reverse logistics supply chain planning process with modular product design that produces and markets products at different quality levels. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model formulates the overall planning process required to maximize profit by considering the collection of returned products, the recovery of modules and the proportion of the product mix at different quality levels. This paper proposes the collection of returnables (end-of life, defective, product under warranty) through retail outlets combined with the recovery of modules from the collected products using a network of recovery service providers. The proposed modular product design approach would create a design criterion that provides an improved recovery process at a lower cost. This study uses a total supply chain view that considers the production, transportation and distribution of products to customers, while a numerical problem illustrates the applicability of the models.

We examine here the significance of network survivability design against multiple-link failures under dedicated protection, shared risk link group (SRLG) and bandwidth squeezing schemes. The proposed mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation seeks to derive some different types of protection considering routing, spectrum assignment, grooming, modulation format as well as shared risk link group constraints. The proposed MILP provides efficient survivability results and resource savings (in terms of spectrum) for a full design of modern EONs.					de Andrade Almeida Júnior, Raul Camelo/O-2543-2017; Assis, Karcius/J-6128-2014	de Andrade Almeida Júnior, Raul Camelo/0000-0003-2047-7167; Assis, Karcius/0000-0002-9424-8810													2162-7339		978-1-7281-8423-4				2020									Th.A2.1															WOS:000629119400313

Specifically, our interest is in designing such an algorithm with the fastest rate of convergence given the topological constraints of the network. As the main result of this paper, we design an algorithm with the fastest possible rate of convergence using a nonreversible Markov chain on the given network graph. We construct such a Markov chain by transforming the standard Markov chain, which is obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings method. We call this novel transformation pseudo-lifting. We apply our method to graphs with geometry, or graphs with doubling dimension. Specifically, the convergence time of our algorithm (equivalently, the mixing time of our Markov chain) is proportional to the diameter of the network graph and hence optimal. As a byproduct, our result provides the fastest mixing Markov chain given the network topological constraints, and should naturally find their applications in the context of distributed optimization, estimation and control.

Finite-time dissipative synchronization of discrete-time semi-Markovian jump complex dynamical networks with actuator faults	SOFT COMPUTING												This paper is concerned with the problem of finite-time synchronization for a class of discrete-time semi-Markovian jumping complex dynamical networks (CDNs) with actuator faults based on reliable control. The main aim of this paper is to design a state feedback controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is finite-time synchronized under a prescribed dissipativity performance level even in the presence of actuator failures. Moreover, a stochastic nature followed by Bernoulli distribution is described in the considered networks due to the occurrence of probabilistic nature in time-varying delays. By composing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional containing triple summation terms with the aid of Kronecker product properties, Lyapunov stability theory and free weighting matrix approach, sufficient criteria are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities that assure finite-time synchronization and meet the dissipativity performance to the addressed CDNs. The usefulness of the presented design scheme is finally verified by numerical examples.

The problem requires finding a network topology that minimizes the sum of the fixed installation facility costs and the expected penalties of unmet multicommodity demands. A two-stage stochastic programming with recourse model is proposed. A simulation-optimization approach is developed to solve this challenging problem approximately. To be precise, the first-stage problem requires solving a specific multi-facility network design problem using an exact enhanced cut-generation procedure coupled with a column generation algorithm. The second-stage problem aims at computing the expected penalty using a Monte Carlo simulation procedure together with a hedging strategy. To assess the empirical performance of the proposed approach, a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) procedure is developed to derive valid lower bounds. Results of extensive computational experiments attest to the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Body Mass Index is proved to not be a sufficient criterion to classify obesity. In this context, a diagnostic support system for determining obesity levels by using electroretinogram signals is designed. To do this, the discrete wavelet transform is applied to three different electroretinogram responses recorded from both eyes. The obtained wavelet coefficients' size is reduced using statistical property. The designed dataset is used in artificial neural networks and artificial neural networks based particle swarm optimization models to classify obesity. We found that the average accuracy of the hybrid model is higher than the traditional model and the cone response is a highly effective response in obesity classification. This study is the first attempt to classify obesity levels based on electroretinogram signals and this study shows that obesity can be classified from electroretinogram signals.

The controller uses an adaptive estimator consisting of a single-layer NN not only to approximate the internal dynamics of an affine nonlinear discrete-time system but also to provide an estimate of the state vector during inter event interval. The NN weights of the adaptive NN estimator are tuned in a aperiodic manner at the event trigger instants unlike periodic updates in standard adaptive neural network (NN) control. A dead zone operator is used to reset the event trigger error to zero as long as the system states continue to remain in a bounded region due to NN reconstruction errors. Lyapunov method is used to derive the event trigger condition, prove uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the NN weight estimation error and system states.

The wide adoption of SDN in industry has motivated the development of large-scale, high-fidelity testbeds for evaluation of systems that incorporate SDN. In this article, we develop a framework to support OpenFlow-based SDN simulation and distributed emulation, by leveraging our prior work on a hybrid network testbed with a parallel network simulator and a virtual-machine-based emulation system. We show how to exploit typical SDN controller behaviors to handle performance issues caused by the centralized controller in parallel discrete-event simulation. In particular, we develop an asynchronous synchronization algorithm for passive SDN controllers and design a two-level architecture for active SDN controllers. We evaluate the system performance, showing good scalability. Finally, we present a case study, using the testbed, to evaluate network verification applications in an SDN-based data center network.

First, based on the novel approach in Lemma 1, the concerned MNNs are converted into traditional neural networks with uncertain parameters. Next, a discrete event-triggered sampling control scheme, which only needs supervision of the system state at discrete instants, is designed for MNNs for the first time. Thanks to this controller, the number of control updates could greatly reduce. Then, by getting utmost out of the usable information on the actual sampling pattern, a newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed to formulate stability and stabilization criteria. It should be mentioned that the LKF is positive definite only at endpoints of each subinterval of the holding intervals but not necessarily positive definite inside the holding intervals. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed results are tested by two numerical examples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we design a framework to decipher the internal dynamics of these continuous depth models by pruning their network architectures. Our empirical results suggest that pruning improves generalization for neural ODEs in generative modeling. We empirically show that the improvement is because pruning helps avoid mode-collapse and flatten the loss surface. Moreover, pruning finds efficient neural ODE representations with up to 98% less parameters compared to the original network, without loss of accuracy. We hope our results will invigorate further research into the performance-size trade-offs of modern continuous-depth models.

Therefore, these decisions should take into account as many of the important aspects of the problem as possible. One aspect that is critical to the economic and environmental performance of a process design is the energy utilization. However, it is common practice to choose a process design without considering any process integration until late in the design process. Such a sequential procedure is known to miss optimal heat-integrated solutions.

We present-a design for the monitoring of the security of an integrated public safety "mixed" network. The Capital Wireless Integrated Network (CapWIN) is such a system, consisting of a diverse and disparate mixture of public and private networks that share information in order to provide public safety services for metropolitan Washington, DC [1]. It is imperative that the members of CapWIN be aware of the status of the other participants in order to anticipate security events. As of now, there are few means for which the members can obtain real-time information pertaining to the security status of all other parties. Our system is designed to use data fusion to provide system monitoring and feedback to all members.

In Z-source inverter, when the variation of the output current from the Z-source network is large, the variation of the inductor current and the capacitor voltage increase in the Z-source network. Therefore, discontinuous current mode (DCM) condition transiently occurs in the Z-source network inductors. DCM condition affects the operation of the Z-source inverter. Against the problem, this paper proposes a new design method of the Z-source inverter to maintain continuous current mode (CCM) condition.

This article presented a multiscale two-stage mixed integer stochastic (MSTMIS) model for optimal design of WWTP networks under uncertainty. The model was first formulated by a general two-stage stochastic nonlinear programming problem and solved by genetic algorithm to obtain the deterministic single nominal scenario and fix the first-stage long-term decisions. A sensitivity analysis was then used to select the most influential parameters, from which second-stage short-term decisions were finalized by generating stochastic scenarios. A real-world case study on development of a WWTP network in the metropolitan area of St. John's, Canada was conducted to examine the efficacy of the proposed model. Optimization results indicated that the total cost over a 20-year span was optimized at $8.28x10(7) by the MSTMIS model, which is lower than that optimized by the traditional one-stage solution algorithm. The proposed MSTMIS model can simultaneously address the challenges posed by uncertainty and multiscale nature and, thus, provide the decision makers more confidence in making economic decisions related to WWTP network design.

Edible high internal phase water-in-oil Pickering emulsion gels (PEGs) with a tunable double scaffold network structure are designed and prepared by food-grade phytosterol nanoparticles (PPs). In PEGs, PPs through hydrogen bonding enable binding of emulsion droplets to form the first scaffold network, giving PEGs high viscoelasticity for 3D printing. In the continuous oil phase, palm kernel stearin (PKST) can crystallize forming the second scaffold network of crystals to reinforce 3D printed objects of PEGs. The PEG can be used as a biocompatible template to engineer edible and rigid porous materials with adjustable strength and pore size depending on the degree of curing. 4D printing of PEGs is achieved by the thermal response of the PKST crystal network, leading to the unlimited potential of highly biocompatible PEGs in many applications.

The event-triggering mechanism is used in both the sensor-to-controller and the controller-to-actuator node to saves more communication constraints.

AI algorithms have progressed over the past decades from perceptron-based neural network (NN) and neuro-fuzzy (NF) system to today's deep neural network (DNN) and neuromorphic computing. Recent DNN hardware accelerators focus on energy-efficient integration of digital circuits to realize real-time DNN operation while neuromorphic processors deploy new memory technologies with analog computation for low power consumption. However, different design approaches can be applied to such processor implementation with their pros and cons. This paper reviews from the early processor designs for NN and NF in both mixed-mode and digital implementations to the recent DNN SoC designs that we have proposed for a decade. The former content deals with NN and NF processors used as a functional building block of a machine vision SoC, while the latter concentrates on integration of the whole DNN function. We also provide a discussion on the approaches, and provide perspective on future research directions.

To meet the charging needs, numerous charging stations are built, which are small because of space and grid limitation in city. Such a high density distribution of charging stations offers EV users more choices when seeking for charging service. In order to offer users better choices with global knowledge, recommendation systems are developed. However, the cost generated from recommendation system is not considered when designing the charging network, which result in an increase of overall system cost. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on the charging network design problem under generalized recommendation systems to find a better co-working solution. We first formulate the EV charging network design as a cost minimization problem, considering construction cost, incentive cost for users' to transfer in the charging network, and cost for the loss of users leaving the system, which is a nonlinear mixed-integer optimization problem. In order to solve such problem, we propose a branch and bound algorithm. By combining local search heuristic and cutting plane process, the exact optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. To demonstrate the superiority of the scheme proposed by us, simulation are conducted.																			2325-3746		978-1-7281-3555-7				2019									UNSP 1570578883	10.1109/wcsp.2019.8927928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/wcsp.2019.8927928													WOS:000522040500082

This paper will firstly focus on modeling of travelers' departure time/route choice behavior under stochastic capacities. By analytically proving the equivalency of the scheduling approach and the mean variance approach, a generalized travel cost function is derived to model travelers' departure time/route choice behavior under uncertainty. The proposed generalized travel cost function, which is more behaviorally sound and flexible, will be adopted to model a reliability-based long term user equilibrium with departure time choices. A reliability-based dynamic network design approach is proposed and formulated in which the numbers of lanes on all potential links are the design variables. A combined road network-oriented genetic algorithm and set evaluation algorithm is proposed to solve the dynamic network design problem. A new systematic approach is proposed to eliminate the infeasible, unrealistic and illogical lane designs in order to reduce the solution space and to save computation time. The proposed reliability-based dynamic network design approach is applied to a hypothetical network, and its solutions are compared to a corresponding static network design approach. It is concluded that the static network design approach may lead to poor designs. In general static traffic assignment underestimates the overall total network travel time and total network travel costs. The dynamic network design approach appears to result in a fairly good allocation of road capacity over space and makes the best utilization of the network capacity over time. A version of the Braess paradox appears in case of reliability-based cost functions in both static and dynamic networks.																					978-1-4419-0819-3				2009							651	673		10.1007/978-1-4419-0820-9_32	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-0820-9_32													WOS:000273561800032

Equity in network design and pricing: A discretely-constrained MPEC problem	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE												This paper presents a novel transport network design approach that incorporates supply-and demand-side factors and emphasises equity as a key objective. The proposed model introduces a planning agency as the dominant player responsible for strategic decision-making to regulate the market and influence the behaviours of other participants. The paper addresses the complex dynamics between the planning agency and other players by formulating and solving a Stackelberg game within a network-constrained transport system. The proposed formulation is a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) which can capture this interaction effectively. The MPEC is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to solve the model by employing disjunctive constraints. To demonstrate the model's capabilities for policy analysis, we conduct numerical experiments on a toy network in Sydney. The computational models developed in this study provide insights into the impacts of different network designs on important aspects of transport systems, including equality in subsidy distribution, toll collection, and modal share among different user groups.

Mixed network design using hybrid scatter search	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												This research proposes a bi-level model for the mixed network design problem (MNDP). The upper level problem involves redesigning the current road links' directions, expanding their capacity, and determining signal settings at intersections to optimize the reserve capacity of the whole system. The lower level problem is the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem. By proving that the optimal arc flow solution of the bi-level problem must exist in the boundary of capacity constraints, an exact line search method called golden section search is embedded in a scatter search method for solving this complicated MNDP. The algorithm is then applied to some real cases and finally, some conclusions are drawn on the model's efficiency. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The fundamental decisions to be made during the design phase are the location of facilities and the capacity allocated to these facilities. An approach to designing sustainable supply networks is to develop and solve a mathematical programming model. The sustainability of supply networks can be measured by multiple objectives, such as economic, environmental, social, and others. Traditional concepts of optimality focus on valuation of already given systems. New concept of designing optimal systems is applied. Searching for a better portfolio of resources leads to a continuous reconfiguration and reshaping of systems boundaries. To respond to rapidly changing market conditions, firms must be able to dynamically form and dissolve business interactions. Using double combinatorial auctions can solve the problem. The proposed combined approach is promising for designing and managing supply networks.																									2015							266	271																WOS:000518372000044

Discrete-time controller for stochastic nonlinear polynomial systems with Poisson noises	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE												This paper presents a solution to the optimal control problem for discrete-time stochastic nonlinear polynomial systems confused with white Poisson noises subject to a quadratic criterion. The solution is obtained in the following way: a nonlinear optimal controller is first developed for polynomial systems, considering the state vector completely available for control design. Then, based on the solution of the state estimation problem for polynomial systems with white Poisson noises, the state estimate vector is used in the control law to obtain a closed-form solution. Performance of this controller is compared to that of the controller employing the extended Kalman filter and the linear-quadratic regulator and the controller designed for polynomial systems confused with white Gaussian noises.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of GP and ANNs for metamodeling of discrete-event simulation (DES) models. Three stochastic industrial systems are empirically studied: an automated material handling system (AMHS) in semiconductor manufacturing, an (s,S) inventory model and a serial production line. The results of the study show that GP provides greater accuracy in validation tests, demonstrating a better generalization capability than ANN. However, GP when compared to ANN requires more computation in metamodel development. Even given this increased computational requirement, the results presented indicate that GP is very competitive in metamodeling of DES models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Designing a Forest Road Network Using Mixed Integer Programming	CROATIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST ENGINEERING												Forest roads are an essential yet costly part of forest management, and optimization methods are important tools for planning road systems to support harvesting. This paper presents a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) optimization model to design a forest access system consisting of logging roads for trucking and access spurs for skidding. The network designed is hierarchical in the sense that the two transport systems require significantly different road standards, and timber may only be transferred from access spurs to forest roads. All timber must be transported from harvest sites to exit nodes that connect the forest road network to public roads. A dense network of potential connections is formed by overlaying a regular grid onto the forest, and then calculating costs of inter-node connections using GIS topographical data. Feasible arcs thus determined are input to the optimization model. The model minimizes total cost of road construction and maintenance, skidding and whole transportation in forest. It can be used to develop road system alternatives to support the process of planning the total access system. The model performance is explored on a study area in a mountainous region, where a persistent access network for partial harvesting is required. High quality solutions were achieved in reasonable computational time.

In the presence of packet dropouts, this paper is concerned with the modeling and control problems for a class of discrete-time stochastic systems with event-triggered schemes. Two different mathematical analysis methods are proposed to model the packet loss when an event-triggered scheme is subject to packet loss. First, a stochastic distributed sequence satisfying the Bernoulli process is utilized to model the triggered packets transmitted in the communication networks. Considering the difference between time-triggered and event-triggered schemes, an equivalent model with a random sequence not satisfying a Bernoulli distribution process is also analyzed, which is not the same as some existing results in the literature. Then, the mean-square exponential stability of resulting augmented system is guaranteed and the prescribed H-infinity performance level is achieved by solving resulting discrete P-problem.

Distributed filtering in networked systems is a challenging problem due to the constraints on both the sensing and the communication capabilities of the system. In this paper, we investigate distributed filtering for a two-node system in discrete-time scenarios. In particular, each node is associated with an unknown state and obtains an observation of the two states at each time. One of the two nodes transmits encoded messages to the other node via a Gaussian channel with feedback. The receiver node infers its unknown state in real-time based on its observations and the received messages. We design an encoding strategy for generating transmitted messages and show that it optimizes the distributed filtering performance when certain conditions on the observation model are satisfied. Numerical results quantify the advantage of the designed encoding strategy compared to reference techniques.

Mixing performance was used to determine the optimum designs at Reynolds number 40. A surrogate modeling method based on a radial basis neural network (RBNN) was used to approximate the value of the objective function. The optimization study was carried out with three design variables; viz., the ratio of the main channel thickness to the pitch length (H/PI), the ratio of the thickness of the diagonal channel to the pitch length (W/PI), and the ratio of the depth of the channel to the pitch length (d/PI). Through a primary parametric study, the design space was constrained.

Quantized output-feedback guaranteed cost control for discrete-time large-scale interconnected systems with actuator faults	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												This paper investigates the problem of designing a decentralized static output feedback control for a class of large-scale interconnected discrete-time systems with quantized signals and time-varying actuator faults wherein the control input is quantized by means of logarithmic quantizer to avoid chattering. Based on Lyapunov stability theory together with the improved reciprocally convex approach, sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Specifically, with the aid of cone complementarity linearization technique, the control law is derived which ensures the asymptotic stabilization of considered system with prescribed H-infinity performance index and also guarantees optimum cost bound in spite of quantization and fault occurs. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the significance of the designed control method.

In this paper, a Command and Control (C2) structure is presented that allows for computer-aided execution of the networked team decision-making process, control of force resources, shared resource dispatching, and adaptability to change based on battlefield conditions. A mathematically justified networked computing environment is provided called the Discrete Event Control (DEC) Framework. DEC has the ability to provide the logical connectivity among all team participants including mission planners, field commanders, war-fighters, and robotic platforms. The proposed data management tools are developed and demonstrated on a simulation study and an implementation on a distributed wireless sensor network.

This model returns a near-to-optimal network configuration with minimum utility cost while allows to select geographically closest matches. The Heat Load Distribution is the subproblem of the network design and has been reported to be quite expensive to solve for large-scale problems. The computational complexity of HLD resides in the number of streams and the feasible networks. An additional challenge, raising particularly in industrial problems, has been the intermediate heat transfer network which aggravates the combinatorial complexity. The presented methodology deals with those difficulties by priority consideration based on the location of process units. It helps significantly reducing the computational time and also comes with a realistic network sketch with respect to the plant layout.

It is driven by increasing complexity, cost and installation space requirements of todays architectures. However, side-by-side integration of mixed-criticality functions poses new challenges with respect to safety and security. To achieve isolated performance for multiple integrated partitions with different criticalities, an efficient separation within computing and communication resources is required. This paper introduces a network virtualization approach for CAN, which enables concurrence of mixed-criticality communication on a single physical CAN bus through a strict performance isolation. We present a design concept as well as a prototypical implementation. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by an analytic evaluation of message latencies and through experimental case studies.

An effective service network design can help to reduce the municipal operation cost and improve its service level. In this paper, we propose an optimization model for the network design of municipal solid waste (MSW) collection in the Nanjing Jiangbei new area. The problem was formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model with an emphasis on minimizing the annual operation cost. The model simultaneously decides on the optimal number of refuse transfer stations (RTSs), determines the relative size and location for each RTS, allocates each community to a specific RTS, and finally identifies the annual operation cost and service level for the optimal scenario as well as other scenarios. A custom solution procedure which hybrids an enumeration rule and a genetic algorithm was designed to solve the proposed model. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to illustrate the impact of changes in parameters on the optimality of the proposed model. Test results revealed that our model could provide tangible policy recommendations for managing the MSW collection.																				1660-4601				DEC	2018	15	12							2812	10.3390/ijerph15122812	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15122812								30544756					WOS:000456527000203

The drive and response systems are disturbed by different uncertain non-linear perturbations. The effects of the non-identical uncertain non-linear perturbations are suppressed by designing some simple controllers. Moreover, by designing new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee that the CNNs can be synchronized in a setting time without using existing finite-time stability theorem. Furthermore, the setting time is explicitly estimated for CNNs with bounded distributed delay and without delay. It is shown that the setting time is dependent on the time delays and the initial values of the coupled CNNs. Some results on synchronization of CNNs are essentially extended.

We approach the hub location problem from a network design perspective. In addition to the location and allocation decisions, we also study the decision on how the hub networks with different possible transportation modes must be designed. In this multimodal hub location and hub network design problem, we jointly consider transportation costs and travel times, which are studied separately in most hub location problems presented in the literature. We allow different transportation modes between hubs and different types of service time promises between origin-destination pairs while designing the hub network in the multimodal problem. We first propose a linear mixed integer programming model for this problem and then derive variants of the problem that might arise in certain applications.

Here, the multi-layer network consists of lambda-layer network and IP-layer network. However, when applying this MILP problem for a large-scale network with a few hundred nodes, huge amount of variables are used and cannot be handled by middle size computers. In order to cope with this problem, some heuristic methods have been proposed and evaluated from viewpoints of accuracy and calculation time for their computation results. These heuristic methods reduce variables at lambda-layer and also decompose the original MILP problem into smaller sub-problems and induce an approximate solution by solving these smaller MILP problems. However, these heuristic methods cannot obtain accurate results in many cases. In this paper, we propose a novel variable reduction method at both lambda-layer and IP-layer by excluding long hop routes. We evaluate our proposed method and the conventional methods and show the availability of our method.

J	Yuan, X; Dong, L; Sun, CY				Yuan, Xin; Dong, Lu; Sun, Changyin			Solver-Critic: A Reinforcement Learning Method for Discrete-Time-Constrained-Input Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS												In this article, a solver-critic (SC) architecture is developed for optimal control problems of discrete-time (DT)-constrained-input systems. The proposed design consists of three parts: 1) a critic network; 2) an action solver; and 3) a target network. The critic network first approximates the action-value function using the sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomial. Then, the action solver adopts the SOS programming to obtain control inputs within the constraint set. The target network introduces the soft update mechanism into policy evaluation to stabilize the learning process. By using the proposed architecture, the constrained-input control problem can be solved without adding the nonquadratic functionals into the reward function.

In particular, a discrete-time CNN model is introduced and the global asymptotic stability of its equilibrium point is analyzed. By taking into account such stability results, a novel technique or obtaining associative memories is developed. The objective is achieved by considering feedback parameters related to circulant matrices and by satisfying frequency domain stability criteria. The approach, by generating CNN's where the input data are fed via external inputs rather than initial conditions, enables both hetero-associative and auto-associative memories to be designed.

In order to optimize the satellite reliability, the reliability optimization method is studied in this paper based on compression algorithm, Bayesian Network (BN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Firstly, the improved compression inference algorithm (ICIA) is proposed to model the BN reliability model of multistate system based on the existing compression and inference algorithms. Then, the reliability optimization problem is formulated, which is a typical discrete optimization problem with the discrete reliability measured in the number of each component's units as design variables. The process of optimization, based on the BN reliability model of multistate satellite system will be achieved by PSO. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated in a microsatellite system reliability optimization, which verifies the importance of satellite reliability optimization in decreasing the cost of satellite development.																					978-1-5090-6017-7				2018							447	453		10.1109/CEC.2018.8477704	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2018.8477704													WOS:000451175500059

To construct such assemblies, nitrogen-donor ligands have been intensively employed to generate an assorted variety of topologies.

Taking into account factors such as network congestion and the defensive role of intrusion detection systems, successful attack events are modeled as a Bernoulli random sequence. To describe the transient trajectory of an NCS under the impact of a random attack, a probabilistic definition of secure trackability is taken. Therefore, an observer -based dynamic output feedback controller is designed in order to achieve the specified probabilistic secure trackability. Specifically, the probabilistic safety output tracking problem is transformed into an input-to-state stability problem in the probabilistic sense for closed-loop systems with some new sufficient conditions, provided that an augmented incremental model is utilized Then, the controller parameters and the upper bound of the quadratic cost function are determined by solving matrix inequalities, while easy-solution forms of the matrix inequalities to be solved are presented by the Schur complementary lemma. Both simulation studies and practical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of ISA.

The reconstruction model is designed to learn a regularization that combines channels and extracts features by leveraging the information sharing among channels of multi-coil images. We propose to recover both magnitude and phase information by taking advantage of structured convolutional networks in image and Fourier spaces.Methods: We develop a novel variational model with a learnable objective function that integrates an adaptive multi-coil image combination operator and effective image regularization in the image and Fourier spaces. We cast the reconstruction network as a structured discrete-time optimal control system, resulting in an optimal control formulation of parameter training where the parameters of the objective function play the role of control variables. We demonstrate that the Lagrangian method for solving the control problem is equivalent to back propagation, ensuring the local convergence of the training algorithm.Results: We conduct a large number of numerical experiments of the proposed method with comparisons to several state-of-the-art pMRI reconstruction networks on real pMRI datasets. The numerical results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method evidently.Conclusion: The proposed method provides a general deep network design and training framework for efficient joint-channel pMRI reconstruction.Significance: By learning multi-coil image combination operator and performing regularizations in both image domain and k-space domain, the proposed method achieves a highly efficient image reconstruction network for pMRI.

The proposed model is multi-period and multi-stage with multi-choice goals under inventory management constraints and formulated by 0-1 mixed integer linear programming. The design tasks of the problem involve the choice of the popup stores to be opened and the distribution network design to satisfy the demand with three multi-choice goals. The first goal is minimization of the sum of transportation costs in all stages; the second is to minimization of set up costs of popup stores; and the third goal is minimization of inventory holding and backordering costs.

Optimizing toll locations and levels using a mixed integer linear approximation approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												This paper addresses the toll design problem of finding the toll locations and levels in a congestion pricing scheme, which minimize the total travel time and the toll-point cost (set-up and operational costs of the toll collecting facilities). Road users in the network are assumed to be distributed according to the principle of user equilibrium, with the demand assumed to be fixed and given a priori. The toll design problem is commonly formulated as a non-linear program, which in general is non-convex and non-smooth, and thus difficult to solve for a global optimum. In this paper, the toll design problem is approximated by a mixed integer linear program (MILP), which can be solved to its globally optimal solution. The MILP also gives a lower bound estimation of the original non-linear problem, and the accuracy of the approximation is improved by iteratively updating the MILP. To demonstrate the approach, we apply the algorithm to two networks: a smaller network with 18 links and 4 OD-pairs to illustrate the properties of the approach, and the Sioux Falls network with 87 links and 30 OD-pairs to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.

It is wildly used in video games, virtual reality and augmented reality. In the fields of computer graphics and animations, our data-driven method generates transition motions of two arbitrary animations without additional control signals. In this work, we propose a novel carefully designed deep learning framework, named deep motion interpolation network (DMIN), to learn human movement habits from a real dataset and then to perform the interpolation function specific for human motions.

Discrete dynamical system modelling for gene regulatory networks of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural tolerance for ethanologenic yeast	IET SYSTEMS BIOLOGY												Composed of linear difference equations, a discrete dynamical system (DDS) model was designed to reconstruct transcriptional regulations in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for ethanologenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a bioethanol conversion inhibitor. The modelling aims at identification of a system of linear difference equations to represent temporal interactions among significantly expressed genes. Power stability is imposed on a system model under the normal condition in the absence of the inhibitor. Non-uniform sampling, typical in a time-course experimental design, is addressed by a log-time domain interpolation. A statistically significant DDS model of the yeast GRN derived from time-course gene expression measurements by exposure to HMF, revealed several verified transcriptional regulation events. These events implicate Yap1 and Pdr3, transcription factors consistently known for their regulatory roles by other studies or postulated by independent sequence motif analysis, suggesting their involvement in yeast tolerance and detoxification of the inhibitor.

A Novel Representation for Boolean Networks Designed to Enhance Heritability and Scalability	2017 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY (CIBCB)					IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)	AUG 23-25, 2017	Manchester, ENGLAND	IEEE				Boolean networks are used to model gene regulatory networks at a relatively high level. Finding Boolean networks with particular properties requires a representation that permits efficient search. In this study a novel representation for Boolean networks is implemented that segments the functioning of the network model that defines the network into discrete pieces. This design is intended to facilitate crossover-based retention of functionality in the networks, i.e. to make properties in an evolving population more heritable. The representation is tested on three different fitness functions and, on one of them, compared to the direct evolution of the entries of a matrix. The fitness function used to compare the novel and direct matrix representation demonstrates substantial superiority of the novel representation. The other two functions demonstrate the effectiveness of the new representation at a diversity of tasks. The representation, while useful for Boolean networks, has a number of potential applications to other domains.

XSBR molecular chains have strong interactions with extended CTS via the formation of ammonium carboxylates bridging crosslinks and hydrogen bonds, which efficiently prevent extended CTS from reagglomerating. Compared with CTS nanoparticles, unfolded CTS expose more amino and hydroxyl groups to XSBR, which results in a denser and stronger network structure. However, because of the rigidity of CTS molecule, unfolded CTS construct a rigid framing in the supramolecular network, which reduces the extensibility of the XSBR/CTS composites. Interestingly, the solution mixing retains abundant air bubbles in the XSBR/CTS solution, which turns out a porous composite.																			1359-835X	1878-5840				FEB	2019	117						116	124		10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.11.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.11.014													WOS:000457664400010

First, we define a fourth-order nonlinear model for a single synchronous generator, then we design an event-triggered mechanism to transfer data through the communication channel when the triggered error is above a certain preestablished threshold. We then design a nonlinear discrete-time CKF for the nonlinear system. We show that the data communication between the sensors and the state estimator is reduced, and the state estimation error is bounded if one selects a proper event-triggered threshold. An example is given to verify the performance of the proposed filter.

The resilience of these network systems becomes a matter of great concern since the increasingly complex network dependency contributes to, although uncommon, devastating cascading failures in real-world network systems. Traditionally, system hardening and restoration are employed sequentially to reduce system failure influence while it may not be effective for mitigating cascading failures in dependent network systems. A new cascading failure model that considers the mix of multiple failures resulting from local and global network load redistributions associated with network dependency is established. A framework which jointly optimizes network system hardening and restoration for improving resilience against mixed cascading failures is proposed. It is designed to minimize total cost, including system hardening cost, restoration cost and economic loss caused by cascading failures. In the case studies, the impact of cascading failures in power generation and transmission systems on distribution systems is explored regarding the comprehensive power network resilience. Mixed-integer genetic algorithms are developed to solve this stochastic problem. The results show that this research can provide insights on how to mitigate and restore real-life dependent network systems cost-effectively from future unforeseen cascading failures.

In the fields of computer graphics and animations, our data-driven method generates transition motions of two arbitrary animations without additional control signals.

Our design approach is to approximate the nonlinear system with a multilayer perceptron of which the activation functions are of the sigmoid type symmetric to the origin. A linear difference inclusion representation is then established for this class of approximating neural networks and is used to design a state-feedback control law for the nonlinear system based on the certainty equivalence principle. The control design equations are shown to be a set of linear matrix inequalities where a convex optimization algorithm can be applied to determine the control signal. Further, the stability of the closed-loop is guaranteed in the sense that there exists a unique global attraction region in the neighborhood of the origin to which every trajectory of the closed-loop system converges. Finally, a simple example is presented so as to illustrate our control design procedure.

Heuristic Optimization Model for the Optimal Layout and Pipe Design of Sewer Systems	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The design of urban stormwater systems and sanitary sewer systems consists of solving two problems: generating a layout of the system and the pipe design which includes the crown elevations, slopes and commercial pipe sizes. A heuristic model for determining the optimal (minimum cost) layout and pipe design of a storm sewer network is presented. The hierarchical procedure combines a sewer layout model formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem which is solved using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) and a simulated annealing optimization procedure for the pipe design of a generated layout was developed in Excel. The GAMS and simulated annealing models are interfaced through linkage of Excel and GAMS. The pipe design model is based upon the simulated annealing method to optimize the crown elevations and diameter of pipe segments in a storm sewer network using layouts generated using GAMS. A sample scenario demonstrates that using these methods may allow for significant costs saving while simultaneously reducing the time typically required to design and compare multiple storm sewer networks.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2016	30	5					1605	1620		10.1007/s11269-015-1191-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-015-1191-8													WOS:000373395500002

A distributed structure is employed in the discrete-time sliding mode control framework by exploiting other sub-systems' information to improve the performance of each local controller/observer so that it can widen the applicability region of the given scheme. As the first step, a stability condition is derived for the overall closed-loop system obtained from applying ODSMC to the underlying interconnected system, by assuming a given structure for the control/observer network. In the second step, we explore a methodology to obtain a sparse control/observer network structure with the least possible number of communication links that satisfies the stability condition given in the first step. The boundedness of the obtained overall closed-loop system is analyzed and a bound is derived for the augmented system state which includes the closed-loop system state and the switching function.

In the first stage, a discrete perceptron fed by six features are used to classify the peaks into two subgroups: (i) definite non-EPs and (ii) definite EPs and EP-like non-EPs. In the second stage, the peaks falling into the second group are aimed to be separated from each other by a modified RBFN designed by a perturbation method that would function as a post-classifier. If there exist redundant data components in training data set, they can be discarded by analyzing the total disturbance of the RBFN output corresponding to the perturbed inputs. Thus, input dimension size is reduced and network becomes smaller. The classification performance of the system is comparatively evaluated for three different feature sets such as raw EEG data, discrete Fourier transform coefficients, and discrete wavelet transform coefficients.

Provided that the agent dynamic is unstable and the diagraph is undirected, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee consensus. The key technique is the adoption of historical input information in the protocol. Especially, when agent's own historical input information is used in the protocol design, the consensus condition is constructed in terms of agent dynamic, communication delay, and the eigenratio of the network topology.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) lowers the cost and complexity of network management by decoupling architecture from infrastructure, which promises the continuous evolution of the network architecture in a flexible manner. The synergy between ICN supporting efficient data dissemination as the norm and SDN providing flexible management framework enables the combination to be a fully controllable framework for efficient data dissemination.

The proposed model incorporates the features of real-life transit network systems and reflects the views of both passengers and the transit agency by considering the in-vehicle travel time, transfers, waiting times at the boarding and transfer stops, overcrowding and under-utilization of vehicles, and vehicle fleet size. Unlike previous studies that simplify several aspects of the transit network design and frequency setting problem, the proposed model is the first to determine routes and their frequencies simultaneously from scratch, i.e., without using line and frequency pools while considering the aforementioned issues, such as transfers and waiting. We solve the proposed model using Gurobi. We provide the results of what-if analyses conducted using a real-world public bus transport network in the city of Kayseri in Turkiye. We also present the results of computational tests implemented to validate and verify the model using Mandl benchmark instances from the literature. The results indicate that the model produces better solutions than the state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature and that the model can be used by public transit planners as a decision aid.

These systems model a wide range of applications, for example, transportation systems with varying vehicle travel time and queueing networks with uncertain arrival and queuing time. This paper presents computational methods for different robust invariant sets of such systems. A recursive algorithm is given to compute the supremal robust invariant sub-semimodule in a given sub-semimodule. The algorithm converges to a fixed point in a finite number of iterations under proper assumptions on the state semimodule. This paper also presents computational methods for positively robust invariant polyhedral sets. A search algorithm is presented for the positively robust invariant polyhedral sets.

First, the monotonicity and convergence of the iterative Q -function sequence are analyzed under some conditions. Moreover, by employing neural networks, the model -free tracking control problem can be overcome for zerosum games. Second, two practical algorithms are designed to guarantee the convergence with accelerated learning. In one algorithm, an adjustable acceleration phase is added to the iteration process of Q -learning, which can be adaptively terminated with convergence guarantee. In another algorithm, a novel acceleration function is developed, which can adjust the relaxation factor to ensure the convergence. Finally, through a simulation example with the practical physical background, the fantastic performance of the developed algorithm is demonstrated with neural networks.

By approximating the uncertain dynamics using neural networks, a distributed adaptive cooperative controller, based on the state information of the neighbouring agents, is proposed. The control design is developed for any undirected connected communication topologies without requiring the accurate model of each agent. This result is further extended to the output feedback case. An observer-based distributed cooperative controller is devised and a parameter dependent Riccati inequality is employed to prove stability of the overall multi-agent systems. This design is less complex than the other design methods and has a favourable decouple property between the observer design and the controller design for uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems. For both cases, the developed controllers guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop network are uniformly ultimately bounded, and the states of all agents cooperatively converge to a small neighbourhood of origin. A comparative study is given to show the efficacy of the proposed method.

J	Hallale, N; Fraser, DM				Hallale, N; Fraser, DM			Capital and total cost targets for mass exchange networks - Part 2: Detailed capital cost models	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												This part of the paper builds on the developments of Part 1. It starts by developing a targeting method for tray columns using detailed capital costing methods. The number of units, column diameters and tray spacings, and the distribution of units and trays will all be considered. The limitations of stages targeting are also discussed, leading to an;explanation of why stages targets may be beaten, and showing how continuous contactors are more analogous to heat exchangers than stagewise contactors. A procedure for determining capital cost targets for networks of continuous contactors (usually packed columns) is then developed. Networks featuring different exchanger specifications are also dealt with. As before, capital cost targets are combined with operating cost targets to give total annual cost targets. The design of networks to meet the targets is then discussed. Systems featuring significant differences in exchanger specifications may require some deviation from ideal (vertical) driving force use. The examples presented in this part of the paper demonstrate that the targets are accurate enough for preliminary design as well as pre-design optimisation. The work in both parts of this paper reduces the amount of design work required when evaluating processes at the conceptual stage. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Because of the unique structure and many degrees of freedom (DoFs) of snake robots, these robots can move on rough terrain or in narrow spaces. However, developing a controller for the locomotion of snake robots with many DoFs is challenging. A control model developed for a snake robot moving in one environment might be unsuitable in other environments. Thus, a mixed compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN)-NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method is proposed in this paper. This method is based on a neuroevolution algorithm and serpentine locomotion, and it can be used to control the locomotion of a snake-like modular robot in multiple environments with different obstacles. In the proposed method, a group of neural networks is constructed for each environment, and these networks are trained using a neuroevolution algorithm for several generations. Some pretrained neural networks for each environment are selected and then integrated to obtain mixed neural networks. These mixed neural networks are then evolved using a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to improve the locomotion of a snake-like modular robot in multiple environments. The results of this study indicated that the mixed CPPN-NEAT method outperformed the combined CPPN-NEAT method and use of MOGA alone (without pretraining, combined networks, and mixed networks) in locomotion control for a snake-like modular robot in three environments with different obstacles.

Real Option Pricing of Network Design Investments	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE												A real option solution and method are used to quantify the value of flexibility for deferral and design strategies in investments made in a network. The model is proposed to address managerial flexibility in transportation planning and can be applied to any network design problem under uncertainty. The core framework is based on the assumption that some variable such as travel demand can be characterized by nonstationary, multi-dimensional stochastic processes, such as geometric Brownian motion. By exploiting that characterization, it is possible to determine the value of the flexibility to defer the investment or to redesign the network by solving a dynamic program with network design subproblem using a least squares Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. The option premium is shown to decompose into a basic deferral premium and a flexible network design premium, which quantifies the cost of committing to preferred alternative in transportation planning. The proposed model is tested on the classic Sioux Falls, South Dakota, network, showing that a traditional discounted cash-flow analysis may support an immediate investment of a continuous network design but that under some conditions, deferral with the option to redesign can offer the greatest option value.

Along with this trend, there emerge quantum neural architectures based on different designs of quantum neurons. A fundamental question in quantum deep learning arises: what is the best quantum neural architecture? Inspired by the design of neural architectures for classical computing which typically employs multiple types of neurons, this paper makes the very first attempt to mix quantum neuron designs to build quantum neural architectures. We observe that the existing quantum neuron designs may be quite different but complementary, such as neurons from variational quantum circuits (VQC) and Quantumflow. More specifically, VQC can apply real-valued weights but suffer from being extended to multiple layers, while QuantumFlow can build a multi-layer network efficiently, but is limited to use binary weights. To take their respective advantages, we propose to mix them together and figure out a way to connect them seamlessly without additional costly measurement. We further investigate the design principles to mix quantum neurons, which can provide guidance for quantum neural architecture exploration in the future. Experimental results demonstrate that the identified quantum neural architectures with mixed quantum neurons can achieve 90.62% of accuracy on the MNIST dataset, compared with 52.77% and 69.92% on the VQC and QuantumFlow, respectively.

Bistable responses in bacterial genetic networks: Designs and dynamical consequences	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES												A key property of living cells is their ability to react to stimuli with specific biochemical responses. These responses can be understood through the dynamics of underlying biochemical and genetic networks. Evolutionary design principles have been well studied in networks that display graded responses, with a continuous relationship between input signal and system output. Alternatively, biochemical networks can exhibit bistable responses so that over a range of signals the network possesses two stable steady states. In this review, we discuss several conceptual examples illustrating network designs that can result in a bistable response of the biochemical network. Next, we examine manifestations of these designs in bacterial master-regulatory genetic circuits. In particular, we discuss mechanisms and dynamic consequences of bistability in three circuits: two-component systems, sigma-factor networks, and a multistep phosphorelay. Analyzing these examples allows us to expand our knowledge of evolutionary design principles networks with bistable responses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Fuzzy-Neuro Model for Normal Concrete Mix Design	ENGINEERING LETTERS												Concrete mix design is a process of proportioning the ingredients in right proportions. Though it is based on sound technical principles and heuristics, the entire process is not in the realm of science and precise mathematical calculations. This is because of impreciseness, vagueness, approximations and tolerances involved. This paper presents the development of a novel technique for approximate proportioning of standard concrete mixes. Distinct fuzzy inference modules in five layers have been framed to capture the vagueness and approximations in various steps of design as suggested in IS: 10262-2003 and IS456-2000. A trained three layer back propagation neural network is integrated in the model to remember experimental data pertaining to w/c ratio v/s 28 days compressive strength relationship of three popular brands of cement. The results in terms of quantities of cement, fine aggregate, course aggregate and water obtained through the present method for various grades of standard concrete mixes are in good agreement with those obtained by the prevalent conventional method.

Next, a neural network is fit to the collection of solutions, with facility locations being the input and total supply chain (SC) costs as the output. Then, the next set of locations is selected to optimize the predicted output of the neural network. Finally, the MILP optimization model is called to test the selected locations, and the results are fed back into the neural network and the process is repeated. Numerical experimentation demonstrates the proposed solution procedures yield near-optimal solutions with 0.10-0.18% increase in objective function value alongside a 40-65% reduction in computational time.																					979-8-4007-0049-1				2023							373	377		10.1145/3576914.3588336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3576914.3588336													WOS:001054880600065

This paper proposes one such possible solution to design Cognitive Radio network with Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) based Software Defined Radio (SDR). It explores the efficient implementation of Software Defined Radio (SDR) to sense and detect white spaces in the spectrum for the use of emergency communication during disaster using Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT). The SDR testbed setup was simulated using MATLAB and observed its performance parameters and it performs better in terms of detected Power level, SNR and detection accuracy. The simulation results prove that this new devised approach has zero interference to the primary user frequency bands and hence not affecting the existing users. Hence, this paper concludes the Proof-of-Concept proposed with improved Quality of Service (QoS).																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-030-05366-6; 978-3-030-05365-9				2019	11319						270	278		10.1007/978-3-030-05366-6_23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-05366-6_23													WOS:000706232700023
J	Dias, WPS; Pooliyadda, SP				Dias, WPS; Pooliyadda, SP			Neural networks for predicting properties of concretes with admixtures	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS												Backpropagation neural networks were used to predict the strength and slump of ready mixed concrete and high strength concrete, in which chemical admixtures and/or mineral additives were used. Although various data transforms were tried, it was found that models based on raw data gave the best results. When non-dimensional ratios were used, arranging the ratios such that their changes resulted in corresponding changes in the output (e.g. increases in ratios to cause increases in output values) improved network performance. The neural network models also performed better than the multiple regression ones, especially in reducing the scatter of predictions. Problems associated with models trained on non-dimensional ratios were uncovered when sensitivity analyses were carried out. A rational approach was used for carrying out sensitivity analyses on these mix design problems by constraining the sum of input values. These analyses, using the raw data based model, showed that the modelling had picked up not only the fundamental domain rules governing concrete strength, but also some well-known second order effects.

J	Tripathy, NS; Kar, IN; Paul, K				Tripathy, Niladri Sekhar; Kar, I. N.; Paul, Kolin			Stabilization of Uncertain Discrete-Time Linear System With Limited Communication	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												This technical note proposes a procedure to control an uncertain discrete-time networked system using an aperiodic stabilizing input information. The system is primarily affected by the time-varying, norm bounded, mismatched parametric uncertainty. Aperiodic exchange of information is done due to bandwidth constraint of the communication network. An event-triggered based robust control strategy is adopted to reduce the effects of system uncertainty in such bandwidth constrained networks. In event-triggered control, the control input is computed and actuated at the system end only when a pre-specified event condition is violated. The robust control input is derived to stabilize the uncertain system by solving an optimal control problem based on a virtual nominal dynamics and a modified cost-functional. It is shown that the robust control law with aperiodic information ensures input-tostate stability (ISS) of the original system in the presence of mismatched uncertainty. Deriving the event-triggering condition for a discrete-time uncertain system and ensuring the stability of such system analytically are the key contributions of this technical note. A numerical example is given to prove the efficacy of the proposed event-based control algorithm over the conventional periodic one.

J	GRAMMATIKAKIS, MD; JWO, JS				GRAMMATIKAKIS, MD; JWO, JS			A DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATOR OF COMMUNICATION ALGORITHMS IN INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE												We demonstrate a discrete-event simulator for evaluating the performance of various routing algorithms (probabilistic and deterministic) in both multicomputers, and multistage parallel interconnection networks. This simulator can route packets in a mesh [1], a generalized hypercube [2], or a star graph [3]. It can also realize connection requirements for a given permutation, on an omega network [4], an augmented data manipulator [5], or a multistage circuit-switched hypercube [6]. Current multicomputer, and multiprocessor designs tend to become increasingly complex. Therefore, it is very difficult to analytically evaluate their performance, and simulator tools become very useful [7]. In this study, we are motivated to design a flexible and efficient simulator of various routing schemes, on both multicomputer, and multiprocessor architectures. Such parallel systems usually incorporate a highly symmetric interconnection network. By exploiting this symmetry, we avoid an explicit representation (adjacency list, or matrix) of the underlying network. Instead, the communication algorithm is ''smart'' to route messages along adjacent nodes. The implementation is also event-driven, which is faster and easier to parallelize, as reported in previous studies [8]. Next, we will briefly describe the available options, and provide a glimpse at current results and future extensions of this tool.																			0302-9743	1611-3349					1992	577						609	610																WOS:A1992KQ19000051

To set up distributed deep learning involves alterations of a great number of the parameter configurations of network/edge devices and DNN models, which are crucial to achieve best performances. Simulations measure scalability of intelligence applications in the early stage, as well as to determine the effects of different configurations, thus highly desired. However, work on simulating the distributed intelligence environment is still in its infancy. The existing simulation frameworks, such as NS-3, etc., cannot extended in a straightforward way to support simulations of distributed learning. In this paper, we propose a novel discrete event simulator, sim4DistrDL, which includes a deep learning module and a network simulation module to facilitate simulation of DNN-based distributed applications.

The problem integrates strategic supply chain networks design decisions (i.e., warehouse location and customer assignment) with tactical inventory control decisions for each warehouse (i.e., order size and reorder point). A novel decomposition approach that deals with the nonconvex nature of the problem formulation is proposed and implemented, based on the Generalized Benders Decomposition. The proposed decomposition yields a Master Problem that addresses warehouses location and customer assignment decisions, and a set of underlying Subproblems (SPs) that deal with warehouse inventory control decisions. Based on this decomposition, nonlinearity of the original problem is captured by the SPs that are solved at optimality, while the Master Problem is a mixed integer linear programming problem. The master is solved using a commercial solver, the SPs are solved analytically by inspection, and cuts to be added into the Master Problem are obtained based on Lagrangian dual information. Optimal solutions were found for 160 instances in competitive times. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to immeasurable states and the presence of symmetric/non-symmetric dead zones, design of controller becomes more challenging. AFMBC is design for approximation of such nonlinear system to a relative degree of accuracy, which can be used for adaptation of nonlinear discrete-time systems with or without the presence of symmetric/non-symmetric dead zones. AFMBC employs as a reference model which is useful to closed-loop pure feedback form of fuzzy controller. AFMBC provides approximation of immeasurable states and minimizes effects of unknown bounded disturbances in the system. Based on Lyapunov method, it is proved that proposed scheme for discrete-time nonlinear systems is asymptotically stable. Hence, not only stability of proposed system is assured, but it is also shows that tracking error of model lies in closed neighbourhood of zero after sufficient number of iterations, i.e. tracking error (e(t)0t). The feasibility of the AFMBC is demonstrated by well-known direct current (DC) motor example and other nonlinear discrete-time problem through simulation.

A block input-state realization of the system, which transforms it to a square system with equal number of inputs and states, is used to develop a receding horizon optimal controller designed to decrease computational expense in relation to more traditional optimal controllers. A nonlinear feedback control law is designed where a neural network in the feedback loop is used to generate an optimal control input. The generated input approximates a solution that is minimal with respect to a quadratic cost function with parameters governing the final states and the magnitude and variation of the control input, for either regulation or tracking. A local stability and robustness analysis of the controller is also presented.

Over the past decades, many methods of descriptor extraction were proposed. In recent years researchers have started to train descriptors via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which have shown their advantages in many other computer vision fields. However, the resulting descriptors are usually represented as a long real-valued vector. That leads to high computational complexity and memory usage in real applications with a large amount of data being processed. To deal with that problem binary local descriptors were designed, but they still have a large size. In this paper, we propose a method of discrete low-dimensional local descriptor creation with lightweight CNN. We show that for small-sized descriptors the quality drops significantly during simple binarization compared to floating-point ones. The experiments on HPatches dataset [ 1] demonstrate that our descretization approach dramatically outperforms the naive binarization for the compact descriptors.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-5045-9; 978-1-5106-5044-2				2022	12084								1208411	10.1117/12.2623166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2623166													WOS:000799214600036

The stability of the continuous network is almost completely clarified: (1) hyperbolic interior equilibria, which are unfeasible, are unstable; (2) the state cannot escape from the unitary hypercube; and (3) a Lyapunov function exists. Numerical methods used to implement the continuous equation on a computer should be designed with the aim of preserving these favorable properties. The case of nonhyperbolic fixed points, which occur when the Hessian of the target function is the null matrix, requires further study. We prove that these nonhyperbolic interior fixed points are unstable in networks with three neurons and order two. The conjecture that interior equilibria are unstable in the general case is left open.

A distributed real-time control system linked through a communication network is bound to be affected by the randomness of communication delay patterns. Statistical modelling techniques, like Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), may be used to model the network traffic. This paper provides a comprehensive coverage of network traffic modelling through the stochastic approach ARIMA with a case study of National Instruments (NI) DataSocket Transport Protocol (DSTP) based on high bandwidth Ethernet. In real-time control systems the controller optimization requires accurate temporal specification of sensitive controller tasks. Logical computation languages such as Time Definition Language (TDL) have successfully eliminated the temporal inaccuracies in designing control software. The paper provides an analytical and programmatic view on the impact and compensation of unpredictable network delays through discrete-time control algorithms, that are designed in Time Definition Language (TDL). The results validate that the discrete implementations are able to compensate for the delay, thus guaranteeing the stability of the control loop in the presence of unpredictable delays.																					978-1-61208-101-4				2010							39	46																WOS:000395113600008

The main purpose of this paper is to design the optimal distributed filter under minimum variance sense for the addressed discrete time-varying systems, where a recursive distributed filtering algorithm is proposed. In particular. an upper bound of the filtering error covariance is given by solving the Riccati-like difference equation, and the filter gain is designed to minimize the upper bound of filtering error covariance. In addition, a new matrix simplification technique is introduced to deal with the sparsity of the sensor networks.

This transportation system is formulated as a bi-level program where the upper level aims to determine the link capacity expansion vector and emission while taking into account the lower level response. This problem can be solved using various optimization algorithms and software. In this study, the CNDP with environmental considerations is designed and solved using the perturbation based approach. The lower level representing the road users subjected to user equilibrium is solved using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The proposed model is tested using a small hypothetical network to show the efficacy of the method. As a contribution of this paper, first it suggests a perturbation based approach for planners to design the capacity expansion, which minimize the total system cost and emission.

J	Szuster, M; Hendzel, Z				Szuster, Marcin; Hendzel, Zenon			Discrete Globalised Dual Heuristic Dynamic Programming in Control of the Two-Wheeled Mobile Robot	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												Network-based control systems have been emerging technologies in the control of nonlinear systems over the past few years. This paper focuses on the implementation of the approximate dynamic programming algorithm in the network-based tracking control system of the two-wheeled mobile robot, Pioneer 2-DX. The proposed discrete tracking control system consists of the globalised dual heuristic dynamic programming algorithm, the PD controller, the supervisory term, and an additional control signal. The structure of the supervisory term derives from the stability analysis realised using the Lyapunov stability theorem. The globalised dual heuristic dynamic programming algorithm consists of two structures: the actor and the critic, realised in a form of neural networks. The actor generates the suboptimal control law, while the critic evaluates the realised control strategy by approximation of value function from the Bellman's equation. The presented discrete tracking control system works online, the neural networks' weights adaptation process is realised in every iteration step, and the neural networks preliminary learning procedure is not required. The performance of the proposed control system was verified by a series of computer simulations and experiments realised using the wheeled mobile robot Pioneer 2-DX.

The property of the dead-zone is discretized. Mean value theorem is used to transform the systems into a special form. The unknown functions in the input-output model are approximated using the radial basis function neural networks. Compared with the results for the discrete non-symmetric dead-zone, this article presents a new algorithm to reduce the computational burden. Lyapunov analysis method is utilized to prove that all the signals in the closed-loop systems are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded.

J	Chen, Y; Zheng, WX				Chen, Yun; Zheng, Wei Xing			Stochastic state estimation for neural networks with distributed delays and Markovian jump	NEURAL NETWORKS												This paper investigates the problem of state estimation for Markovian jump Hopfield neural networks (MJHNNs) with discrete and distributed delays. The MJHNN model, whose neuron activation function and nonlinear perturbation of the measurement equation satisfy sector-bounded conditions, is first considered and it is more general than those models studied in the literature. An estimator that guarantees the mean-square exponential stability of the corresponding error state system is designed. Moreover, a mean-square exponential stability condition for MJHNNs with delays is presented. The results are dependent upon both discrete and distributed delays. More importantly, all of the model transformations, cross-terms bounding techniques and free additional matrix variables are avoided in the derivation, so the results obtained have less conservatism and simpler formulations than the existing ones. Numerical examples are given which demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the practical networked control systems (NCSs), there are usually unavoidable plant and communication delays. It has been known that time delays may not only deteriorate the system performance, but also destabilize the controlled plant. To alleviate the influence resulting from time delays while maintaining performance, a mixed fuzzy-PID/neural network compensating scheme is applied to the pneumatic system with communication delays.

The local and the global observability properties of a Boolean network are then expressed in terms of the polynomial ideal generated by the measured output and its repeated time-shifts (the observability ideal). It is shown that any globally observable Boolean network can be immersed into a polynomial system that is linearizable by output injection, whence a dead-beat observer can be designed in such a case. In case of globally observable Boolean networks, the left inverse of the observability mapping can always be computed in closed-form through a Grobner basis of the observability ideal. More in general, the computation of a Grobner basis of the observability ideal is useful also for the partial inversion of the observability mapping in case of Boolean networks that are not globally observable, as it is shown for a genetic system, the lac operon.					; Tornambe, Antonio/J-2584-2017	MENINI, LAURA/0000-0002-0244-2000; Tornambe, Antonio/0000-0001-9989-2843													0743-1546		978-1-4673-5717-3				2013							4428	4433																WOS:000352223505010

The complex cyber-attacks considered consist of three common types of attacks: replay attacks, deception attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Different from most articles which use independent Bernoulli variables to model the cyber-attacks, this paper considers these attacks into a unified Markovian jump framework for modelling. In order to save the limited network communication resources, the improved DETS is adopted. An appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) containing the proposed improved DETS condition is constructed, and sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee finite-time H-infinity stabilisation of the system. Then, according to a set of feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the co-design of event-trigger and H-infinity controller is given. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.																			0020-7179	1366-5820				AUG 3	2023	96	8					2068	2079		10.1080/00207179.2022.2081259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207179.2022.2081259		MAY 2022											WOS:000803985200001

First of all, the distribution power network incorporating solar panels is modelled as a discrete-time linear state-space equation and its measurements/control information is obtained using a set of sensors and actuators. These electronic devices send the observation information to the EMS via unreliable communication links. In order to stabilize the system, we propose discrete-time distributed static output feedback control strategies based on the linear matrix inequality and semidefinite programming approaches. Using the Taylor series method, delays are integrated into the closed loop system so that the proposed controller runs with less energy resources and computation.

From the computational point of view, parametric identification for large-scale dynamic structures presents a challenging problem because of the convergence of the inverse analysis and the limitation of available measurements. A non-classical sub-structural inverse analysis approach with two neural networks by the direct use of acceleration measurements is proposed. The accuracy and robustness of the approach for parameter identification are examined by numerical simulations with a substructure within a fairly large-scale discrete shear structure model with 50 degree-of-freedom involving all stiffness and damping coefficient values unknown. Based on the two neural networks, the inter-storey stiffness and damping coefficients of the substructure are identified. Different from most of the existing inverse analysis methodologies, the proposed methodology does not require any structural modes or frequencies extraction from dynamic measurements.																			1492-8760					AUG	2007	14		2	3			646	655																WOS:000252392300026

A new model called multi-haul quasi network flow (MH-QNF) for vertical alignment optimization is presented with the goal of improving the accuracy and reliability of previous mixed integer linear programming models. The performance of the new model is compared with two state-of-the-art models in the field: the complete transportation graph (CTG) and the quasi network flow (QNF) models. The numerical results show that, within a 1% relative error, the proposed model is robust and solves more than 93% of test problems compared to 82% for the CTG and none for the QNF. Moreover, the MH-QNF model solves the problems approximately eight times faster than the CTG model.																			0305-215X	1029-0273					2017	49	10					1777	1795		10.1080/0305215X.2016.1271880	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0305215X.2016.1271880													WOS:000408952800009

A PD-type (proportional-derivative-type) pinning control protocol is proposed where only a small fraction of network nodes is controlled in order to achieve the global synchronization performance. Meanwhile, for the sake of decreasing the update frequency of the controller, the periodic intermittent control strategy is developed. The main purpose of the addressed problem is to design a PD-type intermittent pinning feedback controller such that the closed-loop system achieves both the exponential synchronization and the prescribed l(2) - l(infinity) performance index. Subsequently, by means of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, a sufficient condition is established under which the addressed PD-type controller design problem is recast into a linear convex optimization one that can be easily solved via available software packages.

Efforts for extending its boundaries beyond LAN to the carriers' backbone networks are in progress. We study the problem of designing reliable and cost-efficient high-rate (100 Gbit/s) carrier-grade Ethernet in a multi-line-rate telecom network under signal transmission-range constraints. Reliability is achieved using shared-path protection at two levels: (1) Protection-at-Connection (PAC) level, or (2) Protection-at-Lightpath (PAL) level. We study the two cases for their impact on network cost and other performance parameters. We construct a graph, called Mixed Topology (MT), using which it is possible to: (1) identify traffic grooming possibilities, (2) select a path which requires the minimum amount of 311 regeneration, and (3) effectively choose the data rate of a lightpath to be established. Our algorithms, tested on the 17-node German network, lead to the following findings: (1) for both PAL and PAC, our MT-based algorithm resulted in lower network cost and higher lightpath utilization compared with other schemes; and (2) in general, PAL incurs slightly higher cost than PAC.

J	Lin, BC; Lea, CT				Lin, Bey-Chi; Lea, Chin-Tau			Designing Nonblocking Networks With a General Topology	IEEE ACCESS												Conventional theory for designing strictly nonblocking networks, such as crossbars or Clos networks, assumes that these networks have a centralized topology. Many new applications, however, require networks to have a distributed topology, like 2-D mesh or torus. In this paper, we present a new theoretical framework for designing such nonblocking networks. The framework is based on a linear programming formulation originally proposed for solving the hose-model traffic routing problem. The main difference, however, is that the link bandwidths in our problem must be discrete. This makes the problem much more challenging. We show how to apply the developed theorems to tackle the problem of designing bufferless NoCs (networks-on-chip). The proposed bufferless NoCs are deadlock/livelock-free and consume significantly less power than their buffered counterparts. We also present a multi-slice technique to reduce node capacity variations. This can make the proposed NoC architecture more cost efficient in a VLSI (very large-scale integration) implementation. In addition, we offer a detailed delay/throughput performance evaluation of the proposed bufferless NoC in the paper.																			2169-3536						2022	10						8399	8408		10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139732	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139732													WOS:000747194400001

Firstly, a novel discrete-time periodic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is originally proposed to decide when the sensor node transfers the measurement output to its neighbour nodes. Compared with the existing ETMs, the proposed approach only monitors the measurements at each periodic sampling point so that it reduces the energy consumption caused by detection and calculation. Secondly, a piecewise auxiliary function is introduced to deal with the sawtooth characteristic of periodic sampling signals. With the help of such auxiliary function, a co-design criterion of the set-membership estimator and ETM is proposed under the unknown-but-bounded (UBB) noise. Finally, a recursive optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimized ellipsoid estimation set.

The communication between the nodes is achieved by routing packets rather than wires. It supports high degree of reusability, scalability, and parallelism in communication. NoC has emerged as a new paradigm for designing core based System-on-Chip (SoC). The success of NoC design relies greatly on the standardization of the interfaces between IP cores and network fabric. The cores may have different frequency, whereas the network router also may operate at different frequency as per design. So, there is a possibility of loosing some data due to improper synchronization. In this paper, we propose the design of Network Interface to make the IP core compatible to network switch, enabling communication between them.

Moreover, this PA delivers average output power of 14.2 W with an average drain efficiency of 75.7% in the target band.

This approach leads naturally to the design of second-order differential equations which are the mathematical models of the corresponding implementations as neural networks.

By incorporating a theoretical model that can estimate BER changes hop-by-hop along lightpaths, the GA encodes the placements of 1R/2R/3R at intermediate regeneration sites as genes, and takes quality-of-transmission (QoT) and energy-efficiency as the fitness functions. With a relatively small population size (e.g. 30-50), the algorithms obtain multiple qualified MRP results that can satisfy both the QoT and energy requirements within 32 generations, for lightpaths with lengths up to 28 hops. Two crossover and two mutation operators are investigated within the GA. By adjusting the possibilities of the crossover and mutation intelligently, the adaptive scheme outperforms the uniform one by getting a larger percentage of fit individuals. We also propose two selection operators, and demonstrate an adjustable tradeoff between QoT and energy-efficiency.

The activation functions are described by the sector-like nonlinearities that are more general than the commonly used Lipschitz ones. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that the dynamics of the estimation error is globally exponentially stable. An optimization method is employed to deal with the fractional uncertainties presented in the neural networks. The estimator is expected to be robust against parameter uncertainties and tolerant against the sensor saturations. It is shown that the estimator gains can be derived in terms of the delay bounds, uncertainty structures and saturation levels. The desired state estimator is designed via the semi-definite programme method that can be easily implemented by using available software. Finally, a numerical example is applied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, the general synthesis method is provided to find the optimum return loss and phase error of a high-pass/low-pass phase shifter. It is also shown that the conventional design method is a special case of the method presented here. The proposed method facilitates tradeoffs between the bandwidth, phase error, and return loss, which is not possible in the conventional method. Phase bits of 22.5 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees are designed using this method. For the phase bit of 180 degrees, a new topology using a third-order bandpass network and an APN is proposed. The phase error is reduced from 25 degrees to 7.4 degrees and the return loss is improved from 5 to 22 dB over the whole octave band compared to the conventional method. For the cascaded 4-bit phase shifter, the return loss is improved from 5 to 19 dB and the rms phase error is reduced from 13.5 degrees to 4.3 degrees in theory. The experimental results of the 4-bit phase shifter show an rms phase error of 5.9 degrees and a return loss of 13 dB from 530 to 1090 MHz. The maximum amplitude imbalance is 0.6 dB for all 16 phase states.

In many real world engineering systems, it may be difficult to build a single observer that has access to all the measured outputs. One way around this difficulty is to build a network of cooperative observers, each of which obtains a portion of the measurement outputs, that collectively produce an asymptotic estimate of the plant state. In this paper, we construct a network of such observers for a continuous-time linear system. Assuming that these observers are connected through an undirected connected network, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition on the plant parameters under which the network of observers will achieve asymptotic omniscience. A network of cooperative observers is said to achieve asymptotic omniscience if their states all converge to the plant state asymptotically. Numerical simulation results are presented to validate theoretical results. The design of cooperative observers sheds some light on the solution of some other real-world problems, such as the design of networked location-based services and sensor networks.

This paper considers the problem of estimating community memberships of nodes in a directed network, where a node may belong to multiple communities. For such a directed network, existing models either assume that each node belongs solely to one community or ignore variation in node degree. Here, a directed degree corrected mixed membership (DiDCMM) model is proposed by considering degree heterogeneity. An efficient spectral clustering algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of consistent estimation is designed to fit DiDCMM. We apply our algorithm to a small scale of computer-generated directed networks and several real-world directed networks.

The expansion decisions are modeled by binary variables for which we derive additional valid inequalities that greatly help to solve the highly challenging problem. Finally, we present a case study in which we identify three major aspects that strongly influence investment decisions: the estimated average power demand of potentially new consumers, the distance between the existing network and the new consumers, and thermal losses in the network.																			0178-2312					DEC	2020	68	12			SI		985	1000		10.1515/auto-2020-0063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/auto-2020-0063													WOS:000594372400003

This cost function is referred to as "step function" or "staged capacity cost". If a sequential algorithm is used to design the networks it often results in sub-optimal solution due to the so called "long path problem", where the weighted shortest path algorithms rather choose very long paths where such links are chosen where no additional capacity step (and therefore no additional cost step) has to be made. In this paper we propose and compare methods that perform randomised smoothing of these staged capacity cost functions to allow decomposition of the network design problem to a sequence of weighted shortest path searches, that is the mostly used approach. The problem can be interpreted as an Unsplittable Multi-Commodity Flow Problem with staged capacity costs.

A systematic procedure is proposed in this paper to enhance the operational flexibility of a given structure. Specifically, two design options have been investigated: (1) relaxation of the allowed maximum freshwater consumption rate in the nominal design and (2) installation of auxiliary pipelines and/or elimination of existing ones. The flexibility index model proposed by Swaney and Grossmann (1985) has been modified and formulated in a generalized format to evaluate the impact of introducing various modifications into an existing network. Since this model is a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), it is in general very difficult to locate the global optima in the iterative solution processes. A simple and effective initialization procedure has also been devised in this work to facilitate successful convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with two examples in this paper.

Approximation Algorithms Using Generalized Translation Networks with One Hidden Layer	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY												Neural networks are widely studied by many researchers because neural networks can be flexibly applied to many physical areas including particle physics, astronomical physics, plasma physics, pattern recognition, very large scale integrated (VLSI) implementation, wireless networks, robotics and so on. In this paper, we investigate approximation algorithms for continuous multivariate target trajectories by using generalized translation networks. To do this, we first approximate continuous multivariate target trajectories by using multivariate Bernstein polynomials. The multivariate Bernstein polynomials are then approximated by using generalized translation networks. Finally, we can approximate the continuous multivariate target trajectories by using the generalized translation networks. Our approach gives not only the degree of approximation, but also the design of the hidden layer. That is, our research deals with the complexity problem, which is more difficult than the density problem. Moreover, the obtained algorithm does not rely on any smoothness of the multivariate target trajectories, but does rely on the the continuity of the multivariate target trajectories only. To support our theory, we demonstrate a numerical example.																			0374-4884	1976-8524				FEB	2011	58	2					174	181		10.3938/jkps.58.174	http://dx.doi.org/10.3938/jkps.58.174													WOS:000287426100002

In this paper, to avoid unexpected trajectory approximation and overcome the difficulty in obtaining an accurate continuous trajectory, we aim at characterizing an analytical optimal solution for jointly designing the resource allocation and continuous UAV trajectory. We focus on a scenario with UAV at a fixed altitude being deployed to assist the wireless communication with a ground user. With limited energy accessible for the wireless transmissions, we construct a throughput maximization problem for jointly optimizing the continuous transmit power and the UAV's continuous trajectory. Via duality analysis, we obtain the features of the optimal power control and successfully convert the dual problem to a series of pure trajectory design problems, which can be optimally addressed based on a mechanical equivalence approach. Afterwards, we accordingly propose an algorithm for optimally solving the dual problem, from which the optimal joint solution can be analytically constructed in a closed form. Finally, we also verify our proposed algorithm and confirm the optimality of the obtained solution via simulations.

Well arranged nexus between water allocation networks and heat exchanger networks would reduce the water and energy consumption significantly. The aim of this study is to develop a novel mathematical programming model for targeting minimum simplified total annual cost of HIWAN. A new transshipment type of heat exchanger networks (HEN) representation is proposed, with features of stream splitting, stream by-pass, non-isothermal mixing, and isothermal mixing. Constraints are added to follow up on the flowrate consistency when stream splitting or mixing happens. Furthermore, a new formulation is presented to count heat exchanger units. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. It is much easier to get feasible solutions than mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problems, especially for large-scale problems. Three examples including an industrial example and a large-scale case are solved by the proposed model. It is shown that the proposed model is suitable for the synthesis of HIWAN, and more importantly, the obtained results are better than literature records. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The smart software to actualize Distribution network planning is significant for improvement of result scientificity, as well as efficiency of planning work. This paper reviews the characteristics of well-known distribution network planning softwares including IPSA, DPlan and SINCAL. The development trends of distribution network planning software are also analyzed. As a conclusion, the continuous improvement of informatization and intelligence of distribution network planning is the future trend, in the circumstance of the continuous application of new technologies such as data management, distributed processing, display and interaction, artificial intelligence, and the actualization of new functions such as accurate load forecasting, distributed power generations planning, and differentiated planning strategies. An intelligent planning software scheme of function and architecture for distribution network is proposed. The functions of intelligent planning software are attributed by eight modules: diagnosis of power distribution situation, power demand forecasting, network planning and substation allocation, mathematic calculation, investment estimation, input and output benefit analysis, planning results management, and graphic display. The functions of the above modules are designed in detail. The framework of the intelligent planning software is given. The proposed structure of the distribution network planning function is holonomic, and these functions can realize the closed -loop operation from the analysis of current distribution network problems to the proposal of the network planning scheme. The research results can provide reference for the power planning researchers to study the intelligent planning function of the distribution network and can be used as top-level guidance for the network planning software design.																					978-1-5386-8549-5				2018																								WOS:000468028302178

J	Shang, Y				Shang, Ying			Robust invariance in uncertain discrete event systems with applications to transportation networks	IMA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CONTROL AND INFORMATION												This paper studies a class of uncertain discrete event systems over the max-plus algebra, where system matrices are unknown but are convex combinations of known matrices. These systems model a wide range of applications, e.g. transportation systems with varying vehicle travel time and queueing networks with uncertain arrival and queuing time. This paper presents the computational methods for different robust invariant sets of such systems. A recursive algorithm is given to compute the supremal robust invariant sub-semimodule in a given sub-semimodule. The algorithm converges to a fixed point in a finite number of iterations under proper assumptions on the state semi-module. This paper also presents computational methods for positively robust invariant polyhedral sets. A search algorithm is presented for the positively robust invariant polyhedral sets. The main results are applied to the time table design of a public transportation network.

The implementation is based on DM2, a state-of-the-art discrete element modelling technique for simulating the behaviour of energetic materials and modelling shock compaction phenomena. The underlying computational approach is derived from particle methods, where short-range intel actions, both mechanical and thermochemical, determine individual particle movement and state. Using spatial decomposition, a client-server software architecture distributes the computations and, at the language level, Berkeley sockets enable communication between conventional Unix processes on workstations connected by an Ethernet. We evaluate the performance of the system in tev,ns of overall execution rime and efficiency, and develop a simple model of computational and communication costs that enables lo to predict ifs performance in other contexts. We conclude that distributed implementations of short-range particle methods can be very effective, even on non-dedicated communication networks.

The new model includes time-varying degradation rates, translation rates of mRNA, and protein as well as time-delay and bounded external noise, which better approximates the practical GRNs. The aim is to estimate the concentrations of mRNA and protein in the proposed model. Due to the unknown external noise and time-varying parameters in this model, the set-values filtering is adopted. The so-called set-values filtering problem is to find an upper bound for the quadratic estimation error of the filtering dynamics and minimize this bound at each time step provided that the external noise is bounded. A recursive linear matrix inequality (RLMI) based optimization approach is developed to compute the filter gains. The effectiveness of the design method is illustrated via two numerical examples.

Our goal was to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the entire system under both the perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions. For such optimization, we formulated a fractional programming problem, and to overcome its nonconvex objective function and constraints, we developed four successive convex approximation methods. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrated that these algorithms can achieve nearoptimal performance. Furthermore, in the perfect CSI case, EE performance was improved by 62% over the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) scheme, and EE of the proposed RF/VLC network increased by 41% compared with traditional that of the RF heterogeneous wireless networks. In the imperfect CSI case, we first investigated the importance of robust beamforming when channel errors occur. Moreover, the proposed algorithm and network architecture outperformed the MRT scheme and the traditional heterogeneous wireless network by 229% and 93%, respectively. In summary, the careful design of an energy-efficient beamforming scheme was proved essential, and the proposed mixed RF/VLC network architecture was much more energy efficient than those without VLC.

In this study, a new discrete-time RNN (DTRNN) is proposed and investigated to determine an exact solution of dynamic nonlinear equations. Specifically, the resultant DTRNN model is established for solving dynamic nonlinear equations by utilizing a Taylor-type difference rule. This DTRNN model is then theoretically proven to have an O(tau(4)) error pattern, where tau denotes the sampling gap. Comparative numerical results are illustrated to further substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed DTRNN model in comparison with the existing approach.

A linear stability analysis provides several sufficient conditions for an amplitude death state to be unstable, i.e., an odd number property and its extended properties. Furthermore, necessary conditions for stability are provided. These conditions, which reduce trial-and-error tasks for design, and the convex direction, which is a popular concept in the field of robust control, allow us to propose a design procedure for system parameters, such as coupling strength, connection delay, and input-output matrices, for a given network topology.

In this methodology a combination of wavelet transforms, neural networks and evolutionary algorithms are employed. The stochastic nature of the evolutionary algorithms makes the slow convergence. Specially, when earthquake induced loads are taken into account. To reduce the computational burden, a discrete wavelet transform is used by means of which the number of points in the earthquake record is decreased. Then, by using a surrogate model, the dynamic responses of the structures are predicted.

Firstly, by developing two discrete-time cyclic switching laws (i.e., the so-called fastly unstable (or slowly stable) cycle-dependent average cycle dwell time), several new stability criteria for discrete-time cyclic switched nonlinear systems with unstable subsystems are derived in the form of multiple Lyapunov functions. Next, some stability conditions for discrete-time cyclic switched linear systems with unstable modes are also obtained in the case of linear matrix inequalities. It is worth noting that the obtained results provide tighter upper and lower limits for the running time of the system. Furthermore, a stability corollary for discrete-time cyclic switched nonlinear (linear) systems with all stable subsystems is presented. Finally, simulation results of a numerical example and a switching inverter circuit are given to illustrate the potential and efficiency of the developed techniques.

Surrogate Modeling of High-Fidelity Fracture Simulations for Real-Time Residual-Strength Predictions	AIAA JOURNAL												A surrogate-model methodology is described for real-time prediction of the residual strength of flight structures with discrete-source damage. Starting with design of experiment, an artificial neural network is developed that takes discrete-source damage parameters as input and then outputs a prediction of the structural residual strength. Target residual-strength values used to train the artificial neural network are derived from three-dimensional finite-element-based fracture simulations. A residual-strength test of a metallic integrally stiffened panel is simulated to show that crack growth and residual strength are determined more accurately in discrete-source damage cases by using an elastic plastic fracture framework rather than a linear elastic fracture-mechanics-based method. Improving accuracy of the residual-strength training data would, in turn, improve the accuracy of the surrogate model. When combined, the surrogate-model methodology and high-fidelity fracture simulation framework provide useful tools for adaptive flight technology.

J	Shu, SN; Xu, Z; Baldacci, R				Shu, Shengnan; Xu, Zhou; Baldacci, Roberto			Incorporating Holding Costs in Continuous-Time Service Network Design: New Model, Relaxation, and Exact Algorithm	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE												The continuous-time service network design problem (CTSNDP) occurs widely in practice. It aims to minimize the total operational cost by optimizing the schedules of transportation services and the routes of shipments for dispatching, which can occur at any time point along a continuous planning horizon. In order to be cost-effective, shipments often wait to be consolidated, which incurs a holding cost. Despite its importance, the holding cost has not been taken into account in existing exact solution methods for the CTSNDP because introducing it significantly complicates the problem and makes solution development very challenging. To tackle this challenge, we develop a new dynamic discretization discovery algorithm, which can solve the CTSNDP with holding cost to exactly optimum. The algorithm is based on a novel relaxation model and several new optimization techniques. Results from extensive computational experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new algorithm and also demonstrate the benefits that can be gained by taking into account holding costs in solving the CTSNDP. In particular, we show that the significance of the benefits depends on the connectivity of the underlying physical network and the flexibility of the shipments' time requirements.

J	Deng, H; Li, HX				Deng, H; Li, HX			A novel neural approximate inverse control for unknown Nonlinear discrete dynamical systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS												A novel neural approximate inverse control is proposed for general unknown single-input-single-output (SISO) and multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear discrete dynamical systems. Based on an innovative input/output (I/O) approximation of neural network nonlinear models, the neural inverse control law can be derived directly and its implementation for an unknown process is straightforward. Only a general identification technique is involved in both model development and control design without extra training (online or offline) for the neural nonlinear inverse controller. With less approximation made on controller development, the control will be more robust to large variations in the operating region. The robustness of the stability and the performance of a closed-loop system can be rigorously established even if the nonlinear plant is of not well defined relative degree. Extensive simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed neural inverse control.

Battles of mobile payment networks: The impacts of network structures, technology complementarities and institutional mechanisms on consumer loyalty	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL												Most information systems (IS) research takes for granted that consumers' adoption and the use of mobile payment (MP) applications are motivated by generic factors such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Challenging this assumption, we argue that the salient contextual characteristics of MP applications compel a reconsideration and problematization of research on MP adoption and use. Drawing on network effect theory, we examined how contextual network effects and contextual network types determine MP consumer loyalty. Using a mixed methods design, we find that direct network effects (i.e., network size, network centrality, network capability), indirect network effects (i.e., platform-application complementarity, application-service complementarity, service-strategy complementarity) and negative network effects (i.e., general institutional structure, general structural assurance, local institutional structure and local structural assurance) are key determinants of perceived benefits, which further promote MP consumer loyalty. Furthermore, except for general institutional structure and general structural assurance, all of the network effects are important predictors of switching costs, which influence MP consumer loyalty. Finally, the impacts of network effects on MP consumer loyalty differ between consumer- and service-oriented networks. Our study enriches the IS literature by problematizing the core assumption underlying the MP adoption and use research and offering a contextual explanation of MP consumer loyalty. Our work also provides practitioners with insights into how to better leverage network effects on MP consumer loyalty.

J	Lambic, D				Lambic, Dragan			S-box design method based on improved one-dimensional discrete chaotic map	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND TELECOMMUNICATION												A new method for obtaining random bijective S-boxes based on improved one-dimensional discrete chaotic map is presented. The proposed method uses a new special case of discrete chaotic map based on the composition of permutations, in order to overcome the problem with potentially short length of the orbits. The proposed special case is based on the composition of permutations and sine function and has a larger minimum length of the orbits compared to the previous special case of the discrete-space chaotic map. The results of performance test show that the example of S-box generated by the proposed method has good cryptographic properties. The proposed method can achieve large key space, which makes it suitable for generation of larger S-boxes, and the process of generation of S-boxes is not affected by approximations of any kind. Also, proposed method has potential to operate at greater speed and with smaller memory requirements than previous S-box generation method based on discrete space chaotic map, which can be particularly useful for lightweight devices such as wireless sensor networks.

In practical health IoT scenarios, fast and accurate human activity recognition is critically important. In this work, we design and implement a lightweight deep learning solution for human activity recognition based on discrete Fourier transformation. The model has a fairly small number of model parameters while offering high accuracy in activity recognition. The core of the solution is a discrete Fourier transform module inside a neural network, which converts the temporal features of mmWave radar activity data into frequency features before activity recognition is performed by a simple classifier. We have extensively evaluated this solution against other traditional deep learning models in mmWave human activity recognition. The evaluation demonstrates that the DFT-based network can achieve the same accuracy as other traditional neural network models, but with a very small computational load.																			1550-3607		978-1-5386-7462-8				2023							5521	5526		10.1109/ICC45041.2023.10279304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICC45041.2023.10279304													WOS:001094862605103

When incorporated at the edge side, only lightweight deep neural network (DNN) models are affordable due to computational constraint. In this article, a cloud-edge collaborative architecture is proposed combining edge-based inference with cloud-assisted continuous learning. Lightweight DNNmodels are maintained at the edge servers and continuously retrainedwith a more comprehensive model on the cloud to achieve high video analytics performance while reducing the amount of data transmitted between edge servers and the cloud. The proposed design faces the challenge of constraints of both computation resources at the edge servers and network bandwidth of the edge-cloud links. An accuracy gradient-based resource allocation algorithm is proposed to allocate the limited computation and network resources across different video streams to achieve the maximum overall performance. A prototype system is implemented and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with up to 28.6% absolute mean average precision gain compared with alternative designs.

Based on privacy protection, this brief discusses the finite-time (FnT) synchronization of complex networks. Firstly, the FnT convergence theorem for dynamical systems is discussed. Secondly, FnT privacy protection function (PPF) is designed, the main idea of this method is to propose a FnT privacy protection function which can cover up the real state of the controlled complex network, that is, in a FnT, instead of transmitting their actual state values, the controlled network acts on the values of the design function. The designed function is continuous time-varying functions that converge to the true state in FnT. Finally, simulations mean that the proposed design method is effective.

We first introduce the joint modulation strategy for delivering the information of the primary system and the IRS simultaneously. Specifically, the IRS modulates its information in both the received antenna index and the received signal phase; while the transmitter limits its signal phase in a small region to avoid aliasing. For the proposed strategy, we devise an IRS discrete phase shifts design to maximize the received signal power at the selected receive antenna. Then, we propose a receiver constellation design for the IRS's and transmitter's information to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is practical and competitive compared with several existing joint information transmission schemes.																			1674-733X	1869-1919				MAR	2023	66	3							132303	10.1007/s11432-021-3494-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-021-3494-2													WOS:000937154300005

Our design approach is to approximate the nonlinear system with a multilayer perception of which the activation functions are of the sigmoid type symmetric to the origin. A linear difference inclusion representation is then established for this class of approximating neural networks and is used to design a state-feedback control law for the nonlinear system based oil the Certainty Equivalence Principle. The control design equations are shown to be a set of linear matrix inequalities where a convex optimization algorithm can be applied to determine the control signal. Further, the stability of the closed-loop is guaranteed in the sense that there exists a unique global attraction region in the neighborhood of the origin to which every trajectory of the closed-loop system converges. Finally, a simple example is presented so as to illustrate our control design procedure.

Since the formation of cocontinuous phase of the matrix and the precise location of MWCNT in EP phase and graphene in PES phase during reaction-induced phase separation (RIPS), the bi-continuous conductive network came into being. Therefore, satisfactory tensile strength and eligible electromagnetic interference shielding performance can be obtainable at low addition of MWCNT and graphene.

We assume that the control input of each agent is constructed based on weighted difference between its states and those of its neighbor agents. Using the formation information in a decentralized control input with design parameters, we first transform the formation problem into an asymptotically stabilization problem, which is equivalent to designing a Schur polynomial with complex coefficients. Then, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition by performing a bilinear transformation between Schur polynomials and Hurwitz polynomials with complex coefficients. We also discuss how to solve the condition efficiently, and provide numerical examples to demonstrate effectiveness of the theoretical results. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Moosavian, N; Roodsari, BK				Moosavian, Naser; Roodsari, Babak Kasaee			Soccer league competition algorithm: A novel meta-heuristic algorithm for optimal design of water distribution networks	SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION												Water distribution networks are one of the most important elements in the urban infrastructure system and require huge investment for construction. Optimal design of water systems is classified as a large combinatorial discrete non-linear optimization problem. The main concern associated with optimization of water distribution networks is related to the nonlinearity of discharge-head loss equation, availability of the discrete nature of pipe sizes, and constraints, such as conservation of mass and energy equations. This paper introduces an efficient technique, entitled Soccer League Competition (SLC) algorithm, which yields optimal solutions for design of water distribution networks. Fundamental theories of the method are inspired from soccer leagues and based on the competitions among teams and players. Like other meta-heuristic methods, the proposed technique starts with an initial population. Population individuals (players) are in two types: fixed players and substitutes that all together form some teams. The competition among teams to take the possession of the top ranked positions in the league table and the internal competitions between players in each team for personal improvements are used for simulation purpose and convergence of the population individuals to the global optimum. Results of applying the proposed algorithm in three benchmark pipe networks show that SLC converges to the global optimum more reliably and rapidly in comparison with other meta-heuristic methods.

Because the discrete Tchebichef transform (DTT) presents good energy compaction properties, its usage in image compression schemes has been studied as an alternative to the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Embedded applications, such as wireless visual sensor networks, exhibit severe energy consumption restrictions. In such context, low-complexity discrete transforms approximations have been employed for data compression to save energy and bandwidth. In the current work, we proposed a set of low-complexity pruned DTT approximations suitable for low-power embedded systems. The introduced methods are obtained by pruning the state-of-art DTT approximation, being applicable in the image and video coding context. VLSI architectures were realized and the measured results assessed, showing that the proposed pruned methods present significant reduction in computational costs when compared to the DCT. At the same time, the performance is maintained roughly the same, suggesting a favorable trade-off for low-power applications.

A two-phase flow model for Bingham fluids flow in a single saturated fracture is extended to simulate cement grouts propagation in saturated networks. Using this extended model, the impacts of network structure and hydraulic variability, i.e., network geometry and aperture distribution, on the propagation process are investigated through numerical simulations. Cement grout propagation in 50 realizations of a two-dimensional discrete fracture network (2D DFN) are simulated with different cases of aperture variability, i.e. constant aperture, uncorrelated and length-correlated heterogeneous apertures following a truncated lognormal distribution. The results indicate that network structure and hydraulic variability significantly affect the grout propagation in 2D DFN systems. The randomized network structure and uncorrelated heterogeneous apertures significantly delay the propagation rate and largely increase the variability range of the propagation volume fraction. In contrast, in the case with length-correlated heterogeneous apertures, the propagation rate increases, while the variability range and rate of change of the propagation volume fraction decreases. The extended two-phase flow model for fracture networks and the simulation results presented in this work are useful for basic understanding of the processes relevant for design, monitoring and execution of rock grouting.

A network representable function can be minimized by computing a minimum s-t cut of a directed network, which is a very easy and fastly solved problem. Hence it is natural to ask what functions are network representable. In the case of pseudo Boolean functions (functions on {0, 1}(n)), it is known that any submodular function on {0, 1}(3) is network representable. Zivny-Cohen-Jeavons showed by using the theory of expressive power that a certain submodular function on {0, 1}(4) is not network representable. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for the network representability of functions on D-n, where D is an arbitrary finite set. We completely characterize network representable functions on {0, 1}(n) in our new definition. We can apply the expressive power theory to the network representability in the proposed definition. We prove that some ternary bisubmodular function and some binary k-submodular function are not network representable.

Conventional authentication techniques often rely on security keys, credentials, or device fingerprints, which may suffer from either high network overhead or low reliability in highly dynamic environments. To concurrently overcome these challenges, we jointly design the multi-dimensional multiple access and lightweight continuous authentication (MDMA-LCA) to explore multiple domains of the users' access channels for both communication and security enhancement. The access time frame, subchannel, and power allocation of multiple users are formulated as a joint optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum rate (ASR) of the users while continuously authenticating their identities assisted by the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The proposed scheme achieves lightweight continuous authentication by prearranging the access time sequences of multiple users and by verifying them directly and simultaneously at the base station (BS). Then, the joint optimization problem is decomposed and transferred to a maximum flow problem in a designed graph, and a joint MDMA-LCA algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with several existing schemes, the proposed scheme achieves an ASR gain while guaranteeing the continuous authentication of the users.

As the major criterion of delivering a file of targeted data, however, Task-based End-to-end Delivery Delay (TEDD) is hardly evaluated by using the current methods of graphs due to their intrinsic incapability in precision. In this paper, a topology-driven Updated Discrete Graph (UDG) is proposed for confining the low bound of TEDD with a given delivery task by using a tailored edges capacity. In particular, a Minimum TEDD Routing Strategy (MTRS) is designed through solving a correspondingly integral Min-Max optimization problem. The simulation results verifies the advantage of MTRS for TEDD compared with two typical graph algorithms under a group of specific satellite network scenarios.

Patterns correspond to a stable equilibrium in an oscillator network over different coupling coefficients and available network topologies. We show that the discrete graph based version of the Ginzburg-Landau equation, referred to as the graph Ginzburg-Landau dynamics, exhibits n pattern equilibrium for an n-node cycle graph with the sign of the oscillator coupling coefficient dictating the stability of the pattern. The pattern control problem is cast as a discrete Markov Decision Process (MDP) whose state space is the set of patterns realizable on subgraphs of the network. Actions in the MDP correspond to the selection of coupling coefficients and edge switches in the network. Transition sampling is applied to generate the transition probabilities. Dynamic programming can then be used to calculate a stochastic policy that maximizes the expected total reward over an infinite horizon.

A significant part of this work has been heuristic in nature, and the conclusions drawn are generally justified using computer simulations. The general success of the simulation studies has also resulted in the increased use of artificial neural networks as controllers in industrial applications. As a result, there is a real need for a better understanding of the questions and problems that can arise in such contexts. This paper attempts to provide the theoretical foundations as well as insights that are essential for the efficient design of neural network controllers based on inverse control.																			0018-9286					NOV	1999	44	11					2007	2027		10.1109/9.802910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/9.802910													WOS:000083713900003

Conventional control systems for continuous stirred tank polymerization reactor are based on the single-input-single-output design principle. The polymerization process, however, is a typical multivariable system with a highly nonlinear and highly interacting behavior. Consequently, a new design strategy is necessary to overcome the problem of mutual interactions and is indispensable for the improvement of polymerization reactor control. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use a recurrent fuzzy neural network dynamically constructed from the process input-output data and a reference model for direct adaptive control. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by simulation results and is compared with the performance of conventional PI controllers. Exploiting the advantage of multivariable nonlinear control, our dynamically constructed FNN significantly increases the control robustness to disturbances and noise compared to linear PI controllers.

The proposed switched system modeling method is able to describe the uncertainty and the time-varying characteristics of the network-induced delays well. In this paper, for NCSs with short network-induced delays, we co-design the event-triggered condition, the discrete-time state feedback controller and the corresponding switching rule to maintain the stabilization of such a NCS. The presented event-triggered condition only needs to compare the state information of the adjacent sampling instants instead of the inter-sampling states, which can avoid the Zeno behavior that may cause event to be triggered infinitely within finite time. In addition, we design a self-triggered control strategy for NCSs which is allowed to choose when the next sampling time occurs based on the current sampled states and a priori knowledge about the plant.																			2161-2927		978-9-8815-6393-4				2017							7967	7972																WOS:000432015502010

System design choices may affect the network behavior and Network design choices may impact on the System design. For this reason, it is important -at the early stages of the design flow- to model and simulate not only the system under design, but also the heterogeneous networked environment in which it operates. For this purpose, we have exploited a modeling language traditionally used for System design -SystemC- to build a System/Network simulator named SystemC Network Simulation Library (SCNSL). This library allows to model network scenarios in which different kinds of nodes, or nodes described at different abstraction levels, interact together The use of SystemC as unique tool has the advantage that HW, SW, and network can be jointly designed, validated and refined. As a case study, the proposed tool has been used to simulate a sensor network application and it has been compared with NS-2, a well-known network simulator; SCNSL shows nearly two-order-magnitude speed up with TLM modeling and about the same performance as NS-2 with a mixed TLM/RTL scenario. The simulator is partially available to the community at http://sourceforge.net/projects/scnsl/.

PAX: A mixed hardware/software simulation platform for spiking neural networks	NEURAL NETWORKS												Many hardware-based solutions now exist for the simulation of bio-like neural networks. Less conventional than software-based systems, these types of simulators generally combine digital and analog forms of computation. In this paper we present a mixed hardware-software platform, specifically designed for the simulation of spiking neural networks, using conductance-based models of neurons and synaptic connections with dynamic adaptation rules (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity). The neurons and networks are configurable, and are computed in 'biological real time' by which we mean that the difference between simulated time and simulation time is guaranteed lower than 50 mu s. After presenting the issues and context involved in the design and use of hardware-based spiking neural networks, we describe the analog neuromimetic integrated circuits which form the core of the platform. We then explain the organization and computation principles of the modules within the platform, and present experimental results which validate the system. Designed as a tool for computational neuroscience, the platform is exploited Ill collaborative research projects together with neurobiology and computer science partners. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For the immediate response phase, this design has an emphasis on speed, whereas for the reconstruction phase, it has an emphasis on cost reduction. In this paper, we develop a sustainable humanitarian supply chain network for the relief-to-development continuum. Hence, this network ensures an effective and smooth transition from response to reconstruction operations. We develop three network structures that integrate the lean and agile principles to different extents. To determine the best characteristics of such a sustainable supply chain, we use discrete event simulation modeling. We validate and compare each network structure through several scenarios fed by data sets available from the United Nations World Food Programme for operations conducted in the Republic of Congo.

A Convex Optimization Approach to Discrete Optimal Control	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL												In this paper, we bring the celebrated maxweight features (myopic and discrete actions) to mainstream convex optimization. Myopic actions are important in control because decisions need to be made in an online manner and without knowledge of future events and discrete actions, because many systems have a finite (so nonconvex) number of control decisions. For example, whether to transmit a packet or not in communication networks. Our results show that these two features can be encompassed in the subgradient method for the Lagrange dual problem by the use of stochastic and epsilon-subgradients. One of the appealing features of our approach is that it decouples the choice of a control action from a specific choice of subgradient, which allows us to design control policies without changing the underlying convex updates. Two classes of discrete control policies are presented: one that can make discrete actions by looking only at the system's current state, and another that selects actions using blocks. The latter class is useful for handling systems that have constraints on the order in which actions are selected.

Data Mining Statewide Department of Transportation Volumetrically Designed Asphalt Mixture Records	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												In recent years, the asphalt paving industry has been strained by numerous factors including increased asphalt binder costs, funding that has not kept up with material costs, increased societal pressure to recycle, and deteriorating pavement networks. Mix design should account for the market in which it is used, which is very different now than when today's volumetric mix design practices were developed (many of the aforementioned factors were less present). Given this reality, a statewide database of all 1,452 approved mix designs in Mississippi from 2005 to 2018 was compiled and analyzed, and the objective of this paper is to present findings, trends, and unintended consequences of exclusive reliance on volumetrics. With volumetrics-only mix design, asphalt content is primarily controlled by voids in mineral aggregate (VMA), which is influenced by aggregate bulk specific gravity (G(sb)). Minor G(sb) deviations (i.e., within AASHTO d2s limits), can significantly affect VMA, so much so that 99% of Mississippi's mixes could be failing VMA while reported VMA passes. This allows mix manipulation and economization, with 0.8% asphalt content reductions possible while still meeting volumetric requirements. Recycled materials can exacerbate this issue, and common approaches to increase asphalt content (decreasing design gyration level or using finer gradations) are ineffective with fixed VMA requirements. Overall, the mix design database analysis agrees with numerous smaller studies but does so with an entire state's actual practice. This presents a compelling case that volumetrics-only mix design has limitations, and supports ongoing efforts to reintegrate mechanical tests.

In order to increase storage capacities, multivalued activation functions are introduced into associative memories. The stored patterns are retrieved by external input vectors instead of initial conditions, which can guarantee accurate associative memories by avoiding spurious equilibrium points. Some sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure the existence, uniqueness, and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of neural networks with mixed delays. For neural networks with n neurons, m-dimensional input vectors, and 2k-valued activation functions, the autoassociative memories have (2k)(n) storage capacities and heteroassociative memories have min (2k)(n),(2k)(m) storage capacities. That is, the storage capacities of designed associative memories in this article are obviously higher than the 2(n) and min 2(n),2(m) storage capacities of the conventional ones.

In the case of a single temperature interval, we develop a new optimization formulation without problematic big-M parameters.

Therefore, the research of HVFAC under the condition of equal strength has more engineering application value. However, in the current mix proportion design standard, there is no special discussion on the mix proportion design method of HVFAC. In this study, the compressive strength of HVFAC affected by four factors (water-binder ratio, FA content, curing method and curing age) was systematically studied. Based on 594 sets of strength data obtained from experiments, the method to determine the key mix proportion parameters (water-binder ratio and FA content) of equal strength HVFAC was proposed through machine learning algorithms (ML). Two ML methods (i.e., a multiple linear regression (MLR) and an artificial neural networks (ANN)) were developed to predict the HVFAC compressive strength and then their performances were compared. Through comparison, it was found that the mean absolute error and root mean squared error of the ANN model were both lower than the MLR model, and the ANN model has lower error and higher accuracy. In addition, the reliability of the proposed ANN model was verified with data in other literatures, the results showed the errors between the predicted values and the measured values are lower than 25%. The weight contribution rate of each factor to the strength was calculated. Among the four factors, the curing age had the greatest impact on the compressive strength, which contributes up to 60.3%. The influence degree of FA content is greater than that of water-binder ratio. With the development of curing age, the influence degree of FA content and water-binder ratio on the strength gradually decreases while the curing method increases. Finally, according to the ANN prediction results, the key mix parameters design method for equal strength HVFAC under multi-factor conditions was proposed, which provide guidance for concrete preparation in actual engineering.

This study develops a continuous approximation model to provide strategic-level insights. Considering conventional depot charging mode, the proposed model optimises the design parameters of a pure electric bus network such as stop spacing, headway, and batteries' expected charging range. Numerical cases are presented over a wider range of key design parameters. Both analytical and numerical simulations are conducted to compare the results between the proposed system and the diesel bus system. Substituting electric buses for traditional diesel could save CO2 emissions from 47% to 52% and up to 8% of the total cost can be saved with electric buses, and deploying electric bus systems would bring an around 7% increase in capital cost but save 23% operation cost. On a real-world grid network in Xi'an, China, deploying electric buses can save the system cost by 7.7%.																			2324-9935	2324-9943				MAY 3	2024	20	2								10.1080/23249935.2022.2152298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23249935.2022.2152298		DEC 2022											WOS:000893298800001

The main characteristics of the systems are that they take into account the effect of discrete-time dead zone and the system states are not required to be measurable. The stability problem of this class of systems is for the first time to be addressed in this paper. Due to the unavailability of the states and the presence of the discrete-time dead zone, the controller design becomes more difficult. To stabilize the uncertain nonlinear discrete-time systems, the fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown functions, a fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the immeasurable states, and the effect caused by discrete-time dead zone can be solved via establishing an adaptation auxiliary signal. Based on the Lyapunov approach, it is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop system are the semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error is made within a small neighborhood around zero. The feasibility of the developed control scheme is verified via two simulation examples.

J	Iwamasa, Y				Iwamasa, Yuni			On a general framework for network representability in discrete optimization	JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION												In discrete optimization, representing an objective function as an s-t cut function of a network is a basic technique to design an efficient minimization algorithm. A network representable function can be minimized by computing a minimum s-t cut of a directed network, which is an efficiently solvable problem. Hence it is natural to ask what functions are network representable. In the case of pseudo Boolean functions (functions on {0, 1} n), it is known that any submodular function on {0, 1} 3 is network representable. Zivny-Cohen-Jeavons showed by using the theory of expressive power that a certain submodular function on {0, 1} 4 is not network representable. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for the network representability of functions on Dn, where D is an arbitrary finite set. We completely characterize network representable functions on {0, 1} n in our new definition. We can apply the expressive power theory to the network representability in the proposed definition. We prove that some ternary bisubmodular function and some binary k-submodular function are not network representable.

According to the ET network communication and quantization control schemes, an augmented DSMNS model with time-delays is first constructed. Employing stochastic Lyapunov functional and introducing relaxation matrix variables, sufficient conditions are established for the DSMNS to be singularly stochastic finite-time bounded. Besides, the ET gain matrices and ET quantized feedback controllers are co-designed by decoupling matrix variable parameters so that the augmented DSMNS is singularly stochastic finite-time bounded with a specified performance index.

A more general coupled nonlinearity is considered as perturbations of the network, while a serious faulty network named deteriorated network is also proposed to be further study. For the sake of eliminating these adverse impacts for synchronization, indirect adaptive schemes are designed to construct controllers and adjusters on pinned nodes and nonuniform couplings of un-pinned nodes, respectively. According to Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed adaptive strategies are successful in ensuring the achievement of asymptotic synchronization of the complex network even in the presence of perturbed and deteriorated networks.

The channel undergoes both fading and additive noise, and its input power is bounded by a predefined level. We show that there exists a minimal requirement on the network over which an unstable plant can be stabilized via dynamic output feedback. The requirement relates the statistics of channel fading and channel additive noise as well as the power bound of channel input with the Mahler measure of the plant. It is demonstrated that the scaling factor of the network plays an essential role in satisfying the power constraint.

The controller via state feedback is designed to guarantee the stability of NCS and closed-loop positive realness by taking into account packet losses. A periodic communication scheme is utilized among sensor, controller and actuator.

Fatigue testing is conducted using a custom-designed apparatus integrated with a confocal microscope and a moving stage to accurately pinpoint the instance of micron-scale crack emergence. The specimens are monitored throughout the duration of the experiment using a pair of high-frequency ultrasonic transducers. The mixed DNN is trained with ultrasonic time-series data that are obtained from two sets of specimens categorized by different stress concentration factors. To understand the effects of mixing the data from both types of specimens, a parametric analysis is performed by varying the amount of training data from each specimen to develop a series of mixed DNNs. The mixed DNN, when tested on unseen data from both specimens, exhibits an accuracy of over 95%.

Using the maximal covering location problem to design a sustainable recycling network	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Recycling networks are essential to achieve sustainability in supply chains. Moreover, the design of recycling networks commonly focuses on reducing the costs of collecting a specific amount of end-of-life products or maximizing profit. We are interested in different scenarios with a non-profit approach where given an initial budget, our goal is to design a recycling network where the economic benefits from selling products for reuse or recycle are used to increase the network capacity so we maximize the amount of collected end-of-life products. We implement classic operations research techniques to represent the decision-making process with a maximal covering facility location problem that determines the following decisions: the number and location of capacitated collection centers with a limited-service area; the flow of end-of-life products from demand centers to collection centers and then, to capacitated recycling plants; and the amount of collected products sold to the secondary market. We design a mixed-integer linear formulation for our optimization problem, which can be solved with commercial solvers in short computational times for most of the large instances considered in our experimental stage. Numerical results on a case study in Brazil show that our optimization approach is a handy tool to design a recycling network and identify recycling plants with high low-usage rates.

In this paper, a concrete mix ratio design method based on deep learning algorithm and meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed. The main parameters that control and affect the strength of the concrete were selected as input var-iables, including Cement, Fly ash, Blast furnace slag, Water, Superplasticizer, Coarse aggregate, and Fine aggregate of concrete per unit volume. The compressive strength of concrete as output variables, a long short-term memory network model was developed to predict and explain the compressive strength characteristics of concrete. Sensitivity analysis showed that cementitious material and concrete age are the most important factors affecting the compressive strength of concrete. This is in good agreement with the relevant theoretical research. Taking the trained prediction model as the objective function of compressive strength of concrete mix ratio design, combined with the concrete material cost and carbon emission from cradle to gate, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the proportion of each component of concrete to find the optimal mix ratio under specific conditions. The results show that the long short-term memory network can predict the compressive strength of concrete with high accuracy, and replace the traditional explicit mathematical expression to simulate the complex nonlinear relationship of multiple parameters. The established algorithm can calculate the Pareto optimal solution set according to the objective function, and obtain the optimal mix ratio with the least material cost and carbon footprint while meeting the compressive strength required by the project. The results of this work provide an intelligent and efficient design method for deter-mining concrete mix ratio design, which can provide a reference for practical engineering applications to a certain extent.

The decision variables, including the expanded capacity of auto links, the layout of bus routes, the fare levels and the route frequencies, are transformed into multiple sets of binary variables. The layout of transit routes is explicitly modeled using an alternative approach by introducing a set of complementarity constraints.

J	Khakzad, N; Khan, F; Amyotte, P				Khakzad, Nima; Khan, Faisal; Amyotte, Paul			Risk-based design of process systems using discrete-time Bayesian networks	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY												Temporal Bayesian networks have gained popularity as a robust technique to model dynamic systems in which the components' sequential dependency, as well as their functional dependency, cannot be ignored. In this regard, discrete-time Bayesian networks have been proposed as a viable alternative to solve dynamic fault trees without resort to Markov chains. This approach overcomes the drawbacks of Markov chains such as the state-space explosion and the error-prone conversion procedure from dynamic fault tree. It also benefits from the inherent advantages of Bayesian networks such as probability updating. However, effective mapping of the dynamic gates of dynamic fault trees into Bayesian networks while avoiding the consequent huge multi-dimensional probability tables has always been a matter of concern. In this paper, a new general formalism has been developed to model two important elements of dynamic fault tree, i.e., cold spare gate and sequential enforcing gate, with any arbitrary probability distribution functions. Also, an innovative Neutral Dependency algorithm has been introduced to model dynamic gates such as priority-AND gate, thus reducing the dimension of conditional probability tables by an order of magnitude. The second part of the paper is devoted to the application of discrete-time Bayesian networks in the risk assessment and safety analysis of complex process systems. It has been shown how dynamic techniques can effectively be applied for optimal allocation of safety systems to obtain maximum risk reduction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this context, filters with engineered group delay are required. In the state-of-the-art of ASP, this is solved using discrete devices or system in package solutions like SAW filters. The proposal intends to generate network topologies compatible with an implementation in integrated circuit technologies. An example of the design and synthesis of doubly terminated ladder networks are presented to illustrate the proposal. The distortion on the group delay characteristic due to filter transformation is highlighted. It is also shown the trade-off between bandwidth and group delay swing. Finally, a synthesized network is sized for implementation in a 130 nm BiCMOS technology, and the results of its electrical simulation are compared with that of an ideal network.

To leverage relevant information between multiple affective dimensions, multitask learning has been used in the estimation of continuous affective states. Most of the existing multitask continuous affect recognition methods focus on designing elaborate multitask networks. Meanwhile, a few research works consider using multitask training strategies for continuous affect recognition. In general, existing multitask continuous affect recognition methods face the problem of unstable training effects. In this work, to improve the stability of multitask learning, we propose an ensemble learning-enhanced multitask network architecture for continuous affect recognition. In addition, we introduce a novel adaptive weighted loss-based multitask learning strategy to effectively train the proposed multitask continuous affect recognition model. Experimental results, on the RECOLA, SEMAINE and AFEW-VA datasets for continuous affect recognition, demonstrate the potential of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Based on the Taylor expand technology, an equivalent model in affine-like form is derived for the original nonaffine nonlinear system. Then a direct adaptive neural network (NN) controller is implemented based on the affine-like model. By finding an orthogonal matrix to tune the NN weights, the closed-loop system is proven to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. The sigma-modification technique is used to remove the requirement of persistence excitation during the adaptation. The control performance of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by suitably choosing the design parameters.																			1004-4132					FEB	2014	25	1					129	137		10.1109/JSEE.2014.00015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEE.2014.00015													WOS:000333697000015

Optimization theory of hub and spoke network is a highly simplified result in specific constraints of the network composed by the given nodes, so the theory plays little roll in the actual network planning. According to the complex network theory, we establish the route network design model with the constraints of investment limit, non-strict, capacitated and multiple allocation, the aim of model is to minimum the total cost of the route opened cost, the transportation cost, the hub node construction cost, the opportunity cost caused by the not yet been transported; secondly, to study the ILNS-CMAHLP problem based on the Mixed Set Programming (MSP) theory, we make the data model with the set variables, give the logic model to express the relation among input variables, output variables and decision variables, build the solve rule based on the set reasoning algorithm. Finally, we calculate the ILNS-CMAHLP exact solution of NCL language in the POEM optimization platform. Results show that the NCL algorithm, which has the natural modeling and mixed set programming features, is a useful tool to solute the constraints of joint solving of NP-Hard problem, and it will avoid the combination explosion problem of large-scale integer programming; at the same time, it will open the new research direction for the optimization of hub and spoke network with the capacitated etc. constraints, it can provide theoretical guidance and technical support for the actual route network planning.

Given the low computation and battery power capacities of sensor nodes, the key design factors are scalability, energy efficiency and protocol simplicity. In this paper, we present a multi-level, multi-hop sensor network architecture for a network consisting of a few hundred nodes that communicate sensor data to a base-station. We present a unified framework that encompasses network organization, medium access control (MAC) and routing protocols. The MAC protocol, based on TDMA access, is designed to be collision-free, energy-efficient and fair. The routing protocol is multi-hop and uses a simple layered (tree-based) scheme. This reduces the number of control packets that need to be transmitted and hence reduces energy and computation costs. The performance of the network, in terms of delay, throughput, energy consumption and network lifetimes, is also studied in detail using discrete-event simulation.

The objective considered is to minimise a weighted sum of the total length of the links followed by the total length of the paths between the pairs of nodes. First, the problem is formulated in terms of Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Constraint Programming to provide two alternative exact approaches. Then, an adaptive large neighbourhood search (LNS) to overcome memory and runtime limitations of the exact methods in large size instances is proposed. Such approach is based on computing an initial solution and repeatedly improve it by solving relatively small subproblems. We investigate various alternatives for finding an initial solution and propose two different heuristics for selecting subproblems. We have introduced a tighter lower bound, which demonstrates the quality of the solution obtained by the proposed approach. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed using three real-world network topologies from Ireland, UK and Italy, which are taken from national telecommunication operators and are used to design a transparent optical core network. Our results demonstrate that the LNS approach is scalable to large networks and it can compute very high quality solutions that are close to being optimal.

After surveying analog and digital chaotic security systems, we give a state of the art of chaotic S-Box design. The substitution tables are nonlinear maps that strengthen and enhance block crypto-systems. This paper deals with the design of new dynamic chaotic S-Boxes suitable for implementation on wireless sensor nodes. Our proposed schemes are classified into two categories: S-Box based on discrete chaotic map with floating point arithmetic (cascading piecewise linear chaotic map and a three-dimensional map) and S-Box based on discrete chaotic map with fixed-point arithmetic (using discretized Lorenz map and logistic-tent map). The security analysis and implementation process on WSN are discussed. The proposed methods satisfy Good S-Box design criteria and exceed the performance of Advanced Encryption Standard static S-Box in some cases. The energy consumption of different proposals and existing chaotic S-Box designs are investigated via a platform simulator and a real WSN testbed equipped with TI MSP430f1611 micro-controller. The simulations and the experimental results show that our proposed S-Box design with fixed-point arithmetic Lorenz map has the lowest energy-consuming profile compared with the other studied and proposed S-Box design.

The proposed robust control design consists of two steps. First, the robust control problem is transformed to an optimal control problem. Second, the off-policy RL method is used to design the optimal control policy which guarantees the robust stability of the original system with uncertainty. The condition for the equivalence between the robust control problem and the optimal control problem is discussed. The off-policy does not require any knowledge of the system knowledge and efficiently utilize the data collected from on-line to improve the performance of approximate optimal control policy in each iteration successively. Finally, a simulation example is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the presented algorithm for the robust control problem of discrete-time linear system with uncertainty.

In brain networks, there exist some import neural unit modules, which contain meaningful biological insights. Objective: Therefore, we need to find the optimal neural unit modules effectively and efficiently. Method: In this study, we propose a novel algorithm to find community modules of brain networks by combining Neighbor Index and Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) with dynamic crossover, abbreviated as NIDPSO. The differences between this study and the existing ones lie in that NIDPSO is proposed first to find community modules of brain networks, and dose not need to predefine and preestimate the number of communities in advance. Results: We generate a neighbor index table to alleviate and eliminate ineffective searches and design a novel coding by which we can determine the community without computing the distances amongst vertices in brain networks. Furthermore, dynamic crossover and mutation operators are designed to modify NIDPSO so as to alleviate the drawback of premature convergence in DPSO. Conclusion: The numerical results performing on several resting-state functional MRI brain networks demonstrate that NIDPSO outperforms or is comparable with other competing methods in terms of modularity, coverage and conductance metrics.

The involved delays are assumed to be randomly time-varying which are characterized by introducing a Bernoulli stochastic variable. Effects of both variation range and distribution probability of the time delays are considered. The nonlinear activation functions are assumed to satisfy the sector conditions. Our aim is to estimate the state by designing a full order filter such that the filter error system is globally exponentially stable with an expected decay rate and a H-infinity performance attenuation level. The filter is designed by using a piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional together with linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach and average dwell time method. First, a set of sufficient LMI conditions are established to guarantee the exponential mean-square stability of the augmented system and then the parameters of full-order filter are expressed in terms of solutions to a set of LMI conditions. The proposed LMI conditions can be easily solved by using standard software packages. Finally, numerical examples by means of practical problems are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter design.

This lecture is motivated by the recent evolutions of communication networks which have induced new challenges in mixed-integer network optimization ranging from problem formulation to computational methods. Indeed, paradigms such as information-oriented networks, resource abstraction (at the heart of virtualization and other cloudification), and programmability of network functions lead to combine well-established optimization problems with network optimization problems (network design, resource placement/allocation and other multi-commodity flow problems). Beyond dimensioning, provisioning/configuring and scheduling/planning, the combination of conventional network optimization problems with the facility-location or the hub-location problem for instance, provides guidelines for the design of unified processes that address these evolutions. In this tutorial, we exploit mixed-integer programming as a tool for driving early design decisions (thus, not only for the traditional application of network optimization) together with associated requirements such as congestion awareness but also reliability by extending the combined problems to their reliable variant. We compare how the selection of the appropriate routing strategies may also be determined by means of this approach. Finally, in order to cope with demand uncertainty, we extend these formulations to their set-induced robust counterpart. Indeed, robust optimization enables to accommodate spatio-temporal variations in demands and associated traffic for instance without compromising on the solution quality. We conclude this lecture by outlining some of the main research challenges in network optimization at both modeling and computational level.																					978-1-4799-8950-8				2016							1	7																WOS:000387074800001

A novel multi-stage solution methodology is developed to solve the sustainable biomass supply chain network design problem. Geographical Information Systems, and Analytic Hierarchy Process Techniques are used to determine the candidate location of biogas facilities. The proposed multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is capable of making strategic decisions (optimal biogas facility locations with capacities) along with the tactical decisions (transportation network flows). The model incorporates the two objective function of maximization of the profit, and minimization of total distance between poultry farms and biogas facilities. The aim is to determine the optimal number, location, and size of the biogas facilities, as well as the network flow, and electricity generated. The applicability of the model and solution methodology is demonstrated through a case study for a poultry supply chain network in Turkey. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to account for the impact of different parameters on the model. Sensitivity analysis show that both maximum distance parameter, and purchasing prices have major impact on decisions, and financial yield.

A novel high-order adaptive discrete-time sliding-mode control (H-ADSMC) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, a high-order adaptive sliding-mode function on tracking error is constructed, in which the estimated external input disturbance is used as adaptive factor for the sake of reducing the effect of external disturbance. Then, the adaptive sliding-mode controller is obtained, and the convergence of sliding motion is proved. Furthermore, the network-induced disturbance acted on the output of sensor is considered. A new observer is designed to compensate the network-induced disturbance. Finally, the tracking error is analyzed, and the simulations are executed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed H-ADSMC algorithm and designed observer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The network-induced phenomena (e.g. the sensor saturations and the signal quantization) are assumed to be occurring randomly. A stochastic Kronecker delta function is introduced to model such phenomena. The main work aims to design an asynchronous state estimator that assures the underlying error dynamics to be strictly (X, Y, Z)-gamma-dissipative. Based on the stochastic Kronecker delta function method and stochastic analysis technique, we establish some conditions for the sake of guaranteeing the existence of the desired state estimator.

To maximize its market share by optimizing its location and design decisions, the entering firm must anticipate the reactions of the facilities already present in the market. Since the relocation of an existing facility is expensive, the competitors usually improve their qualities to compete with the new firm so as to minimize their market share lost. In this paper, we develop a new method that takes into account the reactions of the facilities already present for a discrete competitive facility location and design problem. The method proposed uses a genetic algorithm to search for optimal or near-optimal locations of new facilities and uses Nash equilibrium to determine the best quality of each facility.

Determining provably good solutions to the minimum number of matches is a bottleneck of designing a heat recovery network using the sequential method. This subproblem is an N P-hard mixed-integer linear program exhibiting combinatorial explosion in the possible hot and cold stream configurations. We explore this challenging optimization problem from a graph theoretic perspective and correlate it with other special optimization problems such as cost flow network and packing problems. In the case of a single temperature interval, we develop a new optimization formulation without problematic big-M parameters. We develop heuristic methods with performance guarantees using three approaches: (i) relaxation rounding, (ii) water filling, and (iii) greedy packing. Numerical results from a collection of 51 instances substantiate the strength of the methods. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Reinforcement-learning-based dual-control methodology for complex nonlinear discrete-time systems with application to spark engine EGR operation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS												A novel reinforcement-learning-based dual-control methodology adaptive neural network (NN) controller is developed to deliver a desired tracking performance for a class of complex feedback nonlinear discrete-time systems, which consists of a second-order nonlinear discrete-time system in nonstrict feedback form and an affine nonlinear discrete-time system, in the presence of bounded and unknown disturbances. For example, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) operation of a spark ignition (SI) engine is modeled by using such a complex nonlinear discrete-time system. A dual-controller approach is undertaken where primary adaptive critic NN controller is designed for the nonstrict feedback nonlinear discrete-time system whereas the secondary one for the affine nonlinear discrete-time system but the controllers together offer the desired performance. The primary adaptive critic NN controller includes an NN observer for estimating the states and output, an NN critic, and two action NNs for generating virtual control and actual control inputs for the nonstrict feedback nonlinear discrete-time system, whereas an additional critic NN and an action NN are included for the affine nonlinear discrete-time system by assuming the state availability. All NN weights adapt online towards minimization of a certain performance index, utilizing gradient-descent-based rule. Using Lyapunov theory, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop tracking error, weight estimates, and observer estimates are shown. The adaptive critic NN controller performance is evaluated on an SI engine operating with high EGR levels where the controller objective is to reduce cyclic dispersion in heat release while minimizing fuel intake. Simulation and experimental results indicate that engine out emissions drop significantly at 20% EGR due to reduction in dispersion in heat release thus verifying the dual-control approach.

Network-based event-triggered filtering for Markovian jump systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL												The problem of event-triggered H-infinity filtering for networked Markovian jump system is studied in this paper. A dynamic discrete event-triggered scheme is designed to choose the transmitted data for different Markovian jumping modes. The time-delay modelling method is employed to describe the event-triggered scheme and the network-related behaviour, such as transmission delay, data package dropout and disorder, into a networked Markovian time-delay jump system. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee that the resulting filtering error system is stochastically stable with a prescribed performance index. A co-design method for the H-infinity filter and the event-triggered scheme is then proposed.

Training neural networks is an optimisation task that has gained prominence with the recent successes of deep learning. Although evolutionary algorithms have been used for training neural networks, gradient descent variants are by far the most common choice with their trusted good performance on large-scale machine learning tasks. With this paper we contribute CORNN (Continuous Optimisation of Regression tasks using Neural Networks), a large suite for benchmarking the performance of any continuous black-box algorithm on neural network training problems. Using a range of regression problems and neural network architectures, problem instances with different dimensions and levels of difficulty can be created. We demonstrate the use of the CORNN Suite by comparing the performance of three evolutionary and swarm-based algorithms on over 300 problem instances, showing evidence of performance complementarity between the algorithms. As a baseline, the performance of the best population-based algorithm is benchmarked against a gradient-based approach. The CORNN suite is shared as a public web repository to facilitate easy integration with existing benchmarking platforms.

Along with the question of where to position hub facilities, how routes are determined is a further challenging problem. Although these two problems are often considered separately in the literature, here, in this study, the two are analyzed together. Firstly, we relax the restriction that a vehicle serves between each demand center and hub pair and propose a mixed-integer mathematical model for the single allocation p -hub median and capacitated vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pick-up and delivery. Moreover, while many studies in hub location problem literature assume that there is a complete hub network structure, we also relax this assumption and present the aforementioned model over incomplete hub networks. Computational analyses of the proposed models were conducted on various instances on the Turkish network. Results indicate that the different capacity levels of vehicles have an important impact on optimal hub locations, hub arc networks, and routing design.					kartal, zuhal/E-6329-2019														1072-4761	1943-670X					2023	30	1					256	272		10.23055/ijietap.2023.30.1.8025	http://dx.doi.org/10.23055/ijietap.2023.30.1.8025													WOS:000953055200001

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural network model, UW-Net, that leverages discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) for effective feature extraction for underwater image restoration. First, a color correction method is applied that compensates for color loss in the red and blue channels. Then, a U-Net based network that applies DWT for down-sampling and IDWT for up-sampling is designed for underwater image restoration. Additionally, a chromatic adaptation transform layer is added to the net to enhance the contrast and color in the restored image. The model is rigorously trained and evaluated using well-known datasets, demonstrating an enhanced performance compared with existing methods across various metrics in experimental evaluations.

A MILP (mixed integer linear programming) model is constructed. The model can achieve simultaneous optimization of locations (i.e., site for energy generation), synthesis (i.e., type, capacity, and number of equipment as well as structure of the energy distribution networks), and operation strategies of the entire system. The model is built in consideration of discreteness of equipment capacities, equipment partial load operation and output bounds as well as the influence of ambient temperature on gas turbine performance. The objective function is the total annual cost for investing, maintaining, and operating the system.

J	Yi, G; Reklaitis, GV				Yi, G; Reklaitis, GV			Optimal design of batch-storage network with multitasking semi-continuous processes	AICHE JOURNAL												The periodic square wave (PSW) model was successfully applied to the optimal design of a batch-storage network. The network structure can cover any type of batch production, distribution, and inventory system, including recycle streams. Here we extend the coverage of the PSW model to multitasking semi-continuous processes as well as pure continuous and batch processes. In previous solutions obtained using the PSW model, the feedstock composition and product yield were treated as known constants. This constraint is relaxed in the present work, which treats the feedstock composition and product yield as free variables to be optimized. This modification makes it possible to deal with the pooling problem commonly encountered in oil refinery processes. Despite the greater complexity that arises when the feedstock composition and product yield are free variables, the PSW model still gives analytic lot sizing equations. The ability of the proposed method to determine the optimal plant design is demonstrated through the example of a high density polyethylene (HDPE) plant. Based on the analytical optimality results, we propose a practical process optimality measure that can be used for any kind of process. This measure facilitates direct comparison of the performance of multiple processes, and hence is a useful tool for diagnosing the status of process systems. The result that the cost of a process is proportional to the square root of average flow rate is similar to the well-known six-tenths factor rule in plant design.

The class-E power amplifier at continuous mode means it can be high efficient on a series matching networks while at sub-nominal condition means it only requires the zero-voltage-switching condition. Comparing with the classical class-E power amplifier, the proposed design method releases two additional design freedoms, which increase the class-E power amplifier's design flexibility. Also, the proposed continuous class-E power amplifier at sub-nominal condition can perform high efficiency over a broad bandwidth. The performance study of the continuous class-E power amplifier at sub-nominal condition is derived and the design procedure is summarised. The normalised switch voltage and current waveforms are investigated. Furthermore, the influences of different sub-nominal conditions on the power losses of the switch-on resistor and the output power capability are also discussed.

We propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILE) formulation that combines a superstructure-based network synthesis model and an integrated planning and scheduling model. In the case study, in which the model is applied to a province in Spain, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and discuss synergies that can he achieved with the resulting integrated energy system.

Sensors have very limited energy and processing capabilities, hence, it becomes necessary to introduce energy efficient algorithms to maximize the lifetime of a sensor node. We propose a new scheduling scheme based on Discrete Time Markov chain models used in genetics for DNA evolution prediction. The proposed scheduler uses a single control parameter to control state changes in order to obtain a compromise between network lifetime and throughput. We discuss the design of such a Discrete Time Markov chain based scheme and compare it to a standard approach in terms of node throughput and lifetime of entire network. Finally, we show the effectiveness of this scheme by simulating various network topologies in a realistic sensor network. Our observations show that just after 75% of simulation steps 90% more nodes are alive with the proposed scheduler. The residual battery power is 82% more and the packet reception rate is increased by 51% for the entire network when compared to the standard approach.

Intelligent surrogate models for low-level analog building blocks are needed to bridge behavioral and transistor-level simulations. With this objective, artificial neural network (ANN) metamodels are incorporated in Verilog-AMS to capture the highly nonlinear response of the analog block. Parameterized ANN Verilog-AMS behavioral metamodels are constructed for efficient system-level design exploration. The application of these intelligent metamodels to multi-objective analog block optimization is demonstrated. To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first paper to integrate artificial neural network models in Verilog-AMS. To demonstrate the application of iVAMS, a biologically-inspired "firefly optimization algorithm" is applied to an OP-AMP design. The optimization process is sped up by 5580x due to the use of iVAMS with negligible loss in accuracy.

In this article, we present SNNAuth, a novel sensor-based continuous Authentication system on smartphones that utilizes Spiking Neural Networks, leveraging biometric behavioral patterns captured by smartphone sensors. To enhance discriminative feature extraction, we introduce positional encoding into the time slicing of normalized sensor data. We design the artificial neural network (ANN)-SNN model, which transforms the trained ANN into an SNN by converting weights and activations into suitable spike neuron models and synaptic connections. The ANN-SNN model, designed for efficient computation and increased robustness, is specifically trained to extract temporal features of a legitimate user. With the extracted features of a legitimate user, we then train the one-class k-nearest neighbors (OC-kNN), which is employed for conducting the classification for all users. Based on the trained ANN-SNN and one-class kNN, SNNAuth determines whether the current user is legitimate or an imposter. Finally, we evaluate the performance of SNNAuth on two public data sets and our data set, and the experimental results demonstrate that SNNAuth outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by achieving the highest accuracy and the lowest equal error rates (EERs) on all three data sets.

Many monitoring campaigns have been based on manual or automated spot sampling - with the long known limitations of this method such as sampling errors and errors due to sample conservation, transport and preparation. On the other hand, only recently have sensors became available which are suitable for continuous application in sewer networks. A large number of practical problems still have to be solved before continuous monitoring in sewer networks will be successful. Additionally, most of the applicable sensors are based on surrogate methods which results in a considerable effort for reference measurements for sensor calibration. Finally, it has to be considered that, depending on the sewer network topography, deposition and remobilisation of pollutants varies considerably, which limits the generality of monitoring results and, subsequently, their applicability as a base for the design of storm water tanks or combined sewer overflows (CSO). A monitoring station for continuous monitoring of load discharges from a CSO has been installed and operated for more than one year. The design and equipment of the measurement station, operational experiences and results are given in this paper.

Real-Time Implementation of a Neural Integrator Backstepping Control via Recurrent Wavelet First Order Neural Network	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS												Wavelets are designed to have compact support in both time and frequency, giving them the ability to represent a signal in the two-dimensional time-frequency plane. The Gaussian, the Mexican hat, and the Morlet wavelets are crude wavelets that can be used only in continuous decomposition. The Morlet wavelet is complex-valued and suitable for feature extraction using continuous wavelet transform. Continuous wavelets are favoured when a high temporal resolution is required at all scales. In this paper, considering the properties from the Morlet wavelet and based on the structure of a recurrent high-order neural network model, a novel wavelet neural network structure, here called recurrent wavelet first-order neural network, is proposed in order to achieve a better identification of the behavior of dynamic systems. The effectiveness of our proposal is explored through the design of a centralized neural integrator backstepping control scheme for a two degree-of-freedom robot manipulator evolving in the vertical plane. The performance of the overall neural identification and control scheme is verified through numerical simulation using the mathematical model for a benchmark prototype. Moreover, real-time results validate the effectiveness of our proposal when using a robotic arm, of our own design, powered by industrial servomotors.

Manufacturers have to collect the medical waste and control its recovery or disposal. Medical waste recovery, which encompasses reuse, remanufacturing and materials recycling, requires a specially structured reverse logistic network in order to collect medical waste efficiently. This paper has attempted to apply the basic theories of reverse logistics to improve the effect of medical waste management.

By taking the full advantage of the packet-based transmission in NCSs, a delay compensation control approach is proposed to actively compensate the network-induced delay in Markovian jump linear system framework. Different from previously reported delay compensation control approaches to NCSs, an output feedback strategy is used to generate the control input packet. A new necessary and sufficient condition is proposed to perform the stability analysis of networked closed-loop system. Furthermore, by using the recently established singular Markovian jump system theory, the controller design problem is solved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by using a numerical example. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To exploit its efficiency, existing works design a mixed-signal deep neural network (DNN) accelerator, which offloads low-precision MVM operations to the memory array. However, they fail to accurately and efficiently support the low-precision networks due to their naive ADC designs. In addition, they cannot be applied to the latest technology nodes due to their premature RRAM-based memory array. In this work, we present 3D-FPIM, an energy-efficient and robust mixed-signal DNN acceleration system 3D-FPIM is a full-stack 3D NAND flash-based architecture to accurately deploy low-precision networks. We design the hardware stack by carefully architecting a specialized analog-to-digital conversion method and utilizing the three-dimensional structure to achieve high accuracy, energy efficiency, and robustness. To accurately and efficiently deploy the networks, we provide a DNN retraining framework and a customized compiler. For evaluation, we implement an industry-validated circuit-level simulator.

An observer-based control scheme is proposed for each node by utilising the outputs of complex networks. The data are transmitted in a digital manner and only the sequence of finite coded signals is sent from the observer to the controller. We design a proper coding-decoding procedure for each node to ensure that the closed-loop networks achieve the expected synchronisation performance. By applying the average dwell-time switching strategy and a uniform quantisation approach, some criteria are firstly presented to ensure the detectability of the complex networks. Then sufficient conditions are provided for the existence of desired observer-based controller, guaranteeing the synchronisation of complex networks. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.																			0020-7721	1464-5319				OCT 3	2022	53	13			SI		2711	2728		10.1080/00207721.2022.2083257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2022.2083257		JUN 2022											WOS:000809771100001

Molecular Design of Multimodal Viscoelastic Spectra Using Vitrimers	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												Imparting multiple, distinct dynamic processes at precise time scales in polymers is a grand challenge in soft materials design with implications for applications including electrolytes, adhesives, tissue engineering, and additive manufacturing. Many competing factors, including the polymer architecture, molecular weight, backbone chemistry, and presence of a solvent, affect the local and global dynamics and in many cases are interrelated. One approach to imparting distinct dynamic processes is through the incorporation of dynamic bonds with widely varying kinetics of bond exchange. Here, statistically cross-linked polymer networks are synthesized with mixed fast and slow dynamic bonds with 3 orders of magnitude different exchange kinetics. Oscillatory shear rheology shows that the single component networks (either fast or slow) exhibit a single relaxation peak while mixing fast and slow cross-linkers in one network produces two peaks in the relaxation spectrum. This is in stark contrast to telechelic networks with the same mixture of dynamic bonds, where only one mixed mode is observed, and here we provide molecular design guidelines for having each dynamic bond contribute a distinct relaxation mode. By comparing the polymer architecture and the difference in the number of dynamic bonds per chain, we have elucidated the role of network architecture in imparting multimodal behavior in dynamic networks. A highly tunable and recyclable material has been developed with control of rubbery plateau modulus (through cross-link density), relaxation peak locations and ratio (through cross-linker selection and molar fractions), and tan delta (through the relationships of the rubbery plateau and relaxation peak locations).

The purpose of this analysis is to propose a new approach to developmental evaluation aimed at building a foundation for continuous improvement in large-scale school improvement networks, on the argument that doing so is essential to producing the intellectual capital needed to replicate effective practices and desired outcomes throughout these networks. We begin by developing a rationale for developmental evaluation, both to illuminate the need and to discuss its coordination with other forms of evaluation. We continue by proposing a logic of developmental evaluation to support analyzing networks as learning systems. We then use that logic to structure a framework for developmental evaluation to support evaluators, network executives, and other stakeholders in analyzing and strengthening the foundation for continuous improvement in a given network. Our analysis suggests that building a foundation for continuous improvement among a large number of networks is an educational reform agenda unto itself, one that must be supported and sustained if these networks are to succeed at the level expected under current accountability regimes.

Particularly, mixing services in Bitcoin, originally designed to enhance transaction anonymity, have been widely employed for money laundering to complicate the process of trailing illicit fund. In this article, we focus on the detection of the addresses belonging to mixing services, which is an important task for anti-money laundering in Bitcoin. Specifically, we provide a feature-based network analysis framework to identify statistical properties of mixing services from three levels, namely, network level, account level, and transaction level. To better characterize the transaction patterns of different types of addresses, we propose the concept of attributed temporal heterogeneous motifs (ATH motifs). Moreover, to deal with the issue of imperfect labeling, we tackle the mixing detection task as a positive and unlabeled learning (PU learning) problem and build a detection model by leveraging the considered features. Experiments on real Bitcoin datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our detection model and the importance of hybrid motifs including ATH motifs in mixing detection.

J	Bor, JC; Wu, AY				Bor, JC; Wu, AY			Realization of the CMOS pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) neural network with on-chip learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING												In this paper, a CMOS very large scale integration (VLSI) design of the pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) neural network with both retrieving and on-chip leaning functions is proposed. In the developed PWM neural system, the input and output signals of the neural networks are represented by PWM signals whereas the multiplication and summation functions are realized by using the PWM technique and simple mixed-mode circuits. Therefore, the designed neural network only occupies the small chip area. After compensating the nonideal effects of the switches, the designed circuits have good linearity and large dynamic range. This makes the implementation of on-chip learning feasible. To demonstrate the learning capability of the realized PWM neural network, the delta learning rule is realized. An experimental chip with two neurons, twelve synapses, and the associated learning circuits has been fabricated on 0.8-mu m CMOS double-poly double-metal process. The chip area, including the pads, is 3.45 mm x 3.45 mm. From the measured results, the linearity of synapses versus weight voltages and input pulsewidths can almost be kept under +/-1% and +/-0.2%, respectively. The measured results on the three learning examples and AND function, or function, and simple Chinese word speech classification have successfully verified the function correctness and performance of the design neural networks.																			1057-7130					JAN	1998	45	1					96	107		10.1109/82.659460	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/82.659460													WOS:000071871200009

Due to hysteresis effects and transient dynamics, this single neuron behaves as an adjustable low-pass filter for specific parameter configurations. Extending this neuro-module by two more recurrent neurons leads to versatile high- and band-pass filters. The approach presented here helps to understand how the dynamical properties of recurrent neural networks can be used for filter design. Furthermore, it gives guidance to a new way of implementing sensory preprocessing for acoustic signal recognition in autonomous robots.

In the first place, a flexible schedule model is introduced to represent the precedence order of all operations. Then, two novel superstructures incorporating all basic elements (i.e. states, tasks, equipment and time) are adopted to capture all production schemes and batch WAN configurations. Specifically, by adding novel components in the original superstructure, a series of optimal network structures with multistage splitting and mixing options which have never been contained within previous superstructure can be easily generated. Finally, a reliable optimization strategy, where deterministic and stochastic searching techniques are combined, is suggested to deal with the resulting mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. Two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Therefore, novices often consult the works of other skilled designers for ideas regarding layout designs. Researchers have previously investigated methods to support the layout design process; these works mainly focused on retrieval methods for similar layout designs, or refinement of existing layouts. To enhance user creativity in designing layouts, assistance is needed for exploring various designs. Herein, we propose a novel deep generative model that enables the generation of various layout designs and guarantees continuous and gradual changes in layouts, for effectively exploring graphic designs. Accordingly, we present an adversarial training method with dual critic networks; we trained our model by a public graphic design dataset. We developed another interaction method that allows the user to change the graphic designs between two different layout styles and categories parametrically. We demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method in generating rich layout variations with representation of latent space by comparing the layout designs generated by our model with by an existing model.																					978-1-4503-8017-1				2021							280	289		10.1145/3397481.3450666	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3397481.3450666													WOS:000747690200035

However, the tool is still needed in building intelligent systems for product design and manufacturing. In this paper, we design a novel multivalued neural network that enables a simplified formulation of the graph isomorphism problem. In order to improve the performance of the model, an additional constraint on the degree of paired vertices is imposed. The resulting discrete neural algorithm converges rapidly under any set of initial conditions and does not need parameter tuning. Simulation results show that the proposed multivalued neural network performs better than other recently presented approaches.

The failure of hubs in such a network can cause severe disruptions. While disruptions can be natural or man-made, a disruption by a rational individual or entity can be significantly detrimental to the network and is often studied as an interdiction problem. It is important to take interdiction effects at the design stage; therefore, we study the three-level capacitated hub-and-spoke network design problem from the perspective of a defender who considers the risk of interdiction by a rational attacker. Within the three levels, the upper level represents the network design level, and the lower two levels represent the bi-level hub interdiction problem. The introduction of capacity constraints within an interdiction model dramatically increases the complexity of the problem, as there can be some unfulfilled flows post-interdiction. Moreover, a flow may or may not be fulfilled through the least-cost route using the nearest hubs. This work makes two major contributions: the first contribution is on the efficient handling of the bi-level hub interdiction problem using the Dual-based approach and the Penalty-based approach, and the second contribution is on solving the overall three-level problem using a super valid inequality. These two contributions allow us to solve large-scale versions of the capacitated multiple allocation p-median hub location problem under the risk of interdiction, which is otherwise mathematically intractable and can be handled only using complete enumeration techniques.

Semi-synthetic mammalian gene regulatory networks	CELL TECHNOLOGY FOR CELL PRODUCTS					19th Meeting of the European-Society-for-Animal-Cell-Technology (ESACT)	JUN 05-08, 2005	Harrogate, ENGLAND	European Soc Anim Cell Technol				While synthetic biology was until recently restricted to network assembly and testing in prokaryotes, decisive advances have been achieved in eukaryotic systems based on current availability of different human-compatible transgene control technologies. The majority of transgene control networks available to date are fully synthetic. Yet, in order to develop their full anticipated therapeutic potential, synthetic transgene control circuits need to be well interconnected with the host cell's regulatory networks in order to enable physiologic control of prosthetic molecular expression units. We have designed three semi-synthetic transcription control networks able to integrate physiologic oxygen levels and artificial antibiotic signals to produce expression readout with NOT IF or NOR-type Boolean logic or discrete multi-level control of several intracellular and secreted model product proteins. Subtle differences in the regulation performance of the endogenous oxygen-sensing system in CHO-K1 and human HT-1080 switched the semi-synthetic network's readout from a classic four-level (high, medium, low, basal) regulatory cascade to a network enabling six discrete transgene expression levels.																					978-1-4020-5475-4				2007							269	+		10.1007/978-1-4020-5476-1_42	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5476-1_42													WOS:000245916900042

However, limited research has been done on a unified framework that can efficiently perform both tasks. In response, we propose INDIRECT (INvertible and Discrete noisy Image Rescaling with Enhancement from Case-dependent Textures), a novel method designed to address image denoising and rescaling jointly. INDIRECT leverages a jointly optimized framework to produce clean and visually appealing images using a lightweight model. It employs a discrete invertible network, DDR-Net, to perform rescaling and denoising through its reversible operations, efficiently mitigating the quantization errors typically encountered during downscaling. Subsequently, the Case-dependent Texture Module (CTM) is introduced to estimate missing high-frequency information, thereby recovering a clean and high-resolution image. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across three tasks: noisy image rescaling, image rescaling, and denoising, all while maintaining a relatively small model size.																			0942-4962	1432-1882				APR	2024	30	2							75	10.1007/s00530-024-01272-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00530-024-01272-5													WOS:001176705600001

The control direction can be omitted and boundaries of sensitivity can be assumed to be unknown. Only the relation between plant's output and control effort is required to design this controller within the format of IF-THEN rules. The closed-loop performance can be guaranteed beside of the convergence of tracking error, adjustable parameters and observer's output.

The video-sharing Web sites allow multiple users to upload the video file. The server in wireless network stores the video file. The issue of redundancy rises when the same video file is stored in different codes in the server. This process initiates additional network load condition on the server. Therefore, bottleneck of the server emerges due to redundancy issue. This paper addresses the redundancy through a combination Motion History Images and discrete wavelet transform-based feature extraction investigation model, and we design an efficient cooperative cache support in the wireless network. The first phase carries the redundancy check for the server, and the second phase adds quick access to the video file through cooperative cache support. This will build the wireless network into more robustness to access streaming traffic mobile nodes. The simulation performance proves video redundancy analysis is important in network-based real-time applications through computation time performance measure and delay measure to access video data in the wireless network.

However, due to various hardware limitations, the spatial resolution of HSIs acquired by the sensor is low. HSI super-resolution (SR) attracts much attention to improve spatial quality. In this letter, a single HSI SR method based on network fusion is proposed. Our method includes the SR network part and fusion part. In the SR network part, we construct 3-D multiscale mixed attention networks (3-D-MSMANs) by cascading 3-D multiscale mixed attention block (3-D-MSMAB) to restore high-resolution HSIs. 3-D-MSMAB consists of the 3-D Res2net module and the mixed attention module. 3-D Res2net module is a simple and effective multiscale method. The mixed attention module is proposed by combining the first- and second-order statistics of features. In addition, we use the mutual learning loss between 3-D-MSMAN so that they can learn from each other. In the fusion part, the fusion module is designed to merge the output of each 3-D-MSMAN. Our method can achieve good results in both simulated and real SR experiments.

The synchronization strategy is based on static output feedback controller followed by an event-triggered scheme. The communication network is assumed to be under various types of cyber-attacks, namely, deception, replay, and denial-of-service attacks. All these attacks are investigated in a unified Markovian jump framework. Using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory and stochastic analysis techniques, some design criteria are derived and formulated in terms of matrix inequalities. A convex optimization algorithm is proposed to design the static output feedback controller. Finally, two chaotic examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the eventtriggered static output feedback controller. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An FD observer is proposed in the framework of neural network (NN) approximation and event-triggered mechanism. Based on the stability analysis at the trigger instants and during the inter-event time intervals, the aperiodic NN weight update law is proposed to remain ultimately bounded of the state and weight estimation errors. The FD decision logic is proposed follows by fault detectability analysis. The scheme ensures the reduction of communication burden while maintaining FD performance.

In addition, performance enhancement necessitates the support of a wide range of frequencies, intelligent dynamic use of the available spectrum resources, and the implementation of a number of types of waveform. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and in particular its ability of Cyclic Prefix (CP) adaptation, appears unable to fulfil the requirements of the different types of services currently utilised by users. In this context, the parameters characterising the different types of waveforms, such as the number of subcarriers, subcarrier spacing (SCS) and slot duration, can be flexibly adapted to the current communication scenario, resulting in a reduction in latency and a significant improvement in user throughput. In this paper, the specific design peculiarities of mixed waveform numerology in relation to high-mobility communication environments characterized by Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) downlink communications are considered. The results demonstrate that the enhancement of network performance according to the specific channel conditions and level of interference, together with the trade-off between spectral efficiency and computational complexity, are the most important challenges in the design and practical implementation of the mixed waveform numerology concept.

A p-design prototype is evaluated for tunable networks in a load-pull investigation at 0.9 GHz, 1.3 GHz, and 2.0 GHz. It is shown that the individual GaN-cell BST networks can handle more than 2 W output power but the network losses reduce the drain efficiency by 10...35 percentage points. The BST losses are found to be extremely frequency dependant under power operation but the linearity of the device is dominated by the non-linearity of the transistor itself. Present limitations and development areas of this novel concept are discussed in the work.

An adaptive impulsive gain law in a discrete-time framework is designed. The delay is handled skillfully by using the Lyapunov-Razumikhin method. To improve the flexibility of impulsive control, an event-triggered impulsive strategy to determine when the impulsive instant happens is designed. Additionally, it is proved that the event-triggered impulsive sequence cannot result in the occurrence of Zeno behavior. Some criteria are derived to guarantee synchronization for delayed chaotic neural networks.

Process synthesis schemes have traditionally considered these processes sequentially in the flowsheet. In the last decade, the superior performance of reactive distillation and membrane reactor units has aroused considerable interest in the area of simultaneous synthesis of reaction, mixing, and separation along with the rest of the flowsheet. Recent incentives to develop new unit operations have resulted in synthesis schemes which focus on specialized cases of reactive distillation. In this paper we consider reaction, mixing, and separation by a mass separating agent. We integrate our reactor network synthesis algorithm, which is a mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation consistent with geometric attainable region concepts, with mass exchange network concepts. The streams in the process are characterized as rich and lean streams, and we develop a reaction-mixing-separation model which may be solved simultaneously with the rest of the process constraints in an attempt to mass integrate the process flowsheet.

Similarly, two bi-level programs are formulated to study the network reserve capacity with SUE problem. The first bi-level program is developed to maximize the network reserve capacity by optimizing signal settings while the traffic demands are reassigned by SUE model. The second program extends the research with Continuous Network Design (CND) problem to find the maximum possible increase in reserve capacity through optimizing allocation of network investment. Two methods, i.e. the sensitivity analysis-based method and Genetic Algorithm (GA), are detailed formulated to solve the bi-level reserve capacity problem. Application of the proposed model and its solution algorithms on two numerical examples find that the network reserve capacity does not always increase with improved quality of drivers' information. Besides, CND can not only help to increase network reserve capacity, but also can help to make more use of physical capacity of road network at Deterministic User Equilibrium (DUE) condition, thus reduces the difference of reserve capacity between the assumptions of SUE and DUE.

Thus, the design optimization process requires an accurate simulation technique featuring high computational efficiency. Achieving an efficient converter design involves large parameter studies. Discrete modelling represents a promising tool for fast and accurate simulation. However, reliable zero crossing detection is absolutely necessary. Root observation by means of Lipschitz constant addresses this issue but anticipates the knowledge of a Lipschitz constant. This paper proposes a method to determine Lipschitz constants in the context of electrical network simulation.																			2151-0997		978-1-5386-5541-2				2018																								WOS:000455139800077

The calculation of the variance of the mass fraction at various nodes on a plane in the channel is used to quantify the mixing. Optimization techniques based on the RBNN method are used to optimize the shape of the grooves on a single wall of the channel. Three design variables, i.e., the ratio of the groove depth to channel height, the ratio of the groove width to groove pitch, and the angle of the groove, are selected for optimization. The mixing index at the end of the patterned groove is employed as the objective function. The dependence of the objective function on the design variables is analyzed. The RBNN method is successfully applied to improve the degree of mixing with modification of the groove shape.

The problem definition results in a mixed-integer nonlinear program with nonconvex constraints. We simplify the formulation, compared to previous literature, in order to reduce the degree of nonlinearity in the constraints and decrease the total problem size. We then formulate the application of outer approximation based methods for the generation of good quality local optimal solutions for the considered co-design problem. Finally, we present the results of applying the developed techniques to two case studies, and also comparing the performances of the outer approximation approaches with those of other local mixed integer nonlinear programming solution methods.

By designing proper controllers, the finite-time stability problem of GRNs with nondifferential discrete time-varying delays is discussed in this brief. Rather than constructing the Lyapunov functional or using the finite-time stability theorem, inequality technique and comparison method are firstly adopted in the analyzation. Then, several sufficient algebraic criteria are derived to ensure the finite-time stability of addressed delayed GRNs. The results are general and contain the exponential stability as a special case.

Dual band stop filter design via frequency transformation and synthesis with lumped resonators	IET CIRCUITS DEVICES & SYSTEMS												This study presents a new compact design technique for dual band stop (DBS) filter. Analytical formulation of DBS frequency transformation/mapping is derived in terms of parametric representation of band characteristic of DBS filter. The analytical derivation of the transformation function is based on sequential application of classical low pass to band stop (LP to BS) and low pass to band pass (LP to BP) transformations. Assigned band characteristic of DBS filter can be achieved by applying the proposed transformation function on an LP prototype network. The explicit network topologies for DBS reactance mapping are presented. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the proposed mapping function. An implantation example of DBS filter for GSM900 and GSM1800/UMTS bands is given. Mixed element realisation of the designed filter and measurement results of the design are presented.

The individual physical processes in the fracture propagation are represented by separate program modules: the TOUGH2 code for multiphase flow and mass transport based on the finite volume approach; and the rigid-body-spring network (RBSN) model for mechanical and fracture-damage behavior, which are coupled with each other. Fractures are modeled as discrete features, of which the hydrological properties are evaluated from the fracture deformation and aperture change. The verification of the TOUGH RBSN code is performed against a 2D analytical model for single hydraulic fracture propagation. Subsequently, modeling capabilities for hydraulic fracturing are demonstrated through simulations of laboratory experiments conducted on rock-analogue (soda-lime glass) samples containing a designed network of pre-existing fractures. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted by changing the modeling parameters, such as viscosity of injected fluid, strength of pre-existing fractures, and confining stress conditions. The hydraulic fracturing characteristics attributed to the modeling parameters are investigated through comparisons of the simulation results.

Unlike the usual VLSI implementation of vision chips, this circuit is based on a mixed analog-digital technology where the processing is realized using current mode analog approach while the cellular neural network topology (size of the window and connectivity) is realized using a modified digital read-out circuit. A significant processing speed-up is achieved using this technique since the window-based processing of the SICNN is realized in analog-domain while reading the pixel using the modified digital read-out circuit. A prototype including a 58 x 58 pixels and the SICNN processor with a programmable user-defined window size of 3 x 3 or 5 x 5 has been designed.

First, given the solution to a fluid optimization problem, a discrete-review policy is described for translating the fluid optimal control policy into an implementable policy for the stochastic network. Such a policy has been proved to be stable and achieve asymptotically optimal performance under fluid scaling. Using this translation mechanism one can proceed in formulating a fluid optimal control problem which incorporates diverse design and performance specifications, as it is typical in realistic applications. Finally, a simple approximation algorithm for the value function of fluid optimal control problems for a general class of convex performance criteria is described.																			0191-2216		0-7803-4187-2				1997							1208	1213																WOS:000072164400238

J	Papadopoulos, T				Papadopoulos, Thanos			Continuous improvement and dynamic actor associations A study of lean thinking implementation in the UK National Health Service	LEADERSHIP IN HEALTH SERVICES												Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore the link between continuous improvement (CI) and dynamic actor associations through a case of lean thinking implementation in healthcare. Design/methodology/approach - The paper follows the qualitative case study strategy. Data were collected by interviewing (tape-recording) managers and staff, analysing relevant written project material, and conducting non-participant observations. Findings - The findings suggest that the implementation of CI depends on the emergence of a "favouring" network from the dynamic associations between heterogeneous entities. This network aims at facilitating change leadership, establishing behaviour/culture prone to CI, and constructing a behaviour non-resistant to CI needed for creating competencies for the continuous roll-outs of such changes. Continuous translation is the underlying mechanism for establishing the favouring network. Originality/value - The paper addresses the literature gap regarding the role of dynamic actor associations in shaping CI in a public sector context. It does not aim at generalising the results of the case study; it informs current theory by revealing that the success of CI deployment depends on the emergence of a CI-favouring network, which will continuously transform opposing views into accepting CI.

For network communications, anonymity can be provided by a mix network (mixnet). A mixnet is a multistage system that uses cryptography and permutations to provide anonymity. The basic idea of a mixnet has evolved into a number of different classes. in addition to presenting the existing mixnet classifications, this paper classifies mixnets based on the verification mechanisms employed for robustness. The construction of mixnets is presented under a common framework to provide insight into both the design and weaknesses of existing solutions.

A possibilistic programming approach for closed-loop supply chain network design under uncertainty	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS												The design of closed-loop supply chain networks has attracted more attention in recent years according to business and environmental factors. The significance of accounting for uncertainty and risk in such networks spurs an interest to develop appropriate decision making tools to cope with uncertain and imprecise parameters in closed-loop supply chain network design problems. This paper proposes a hi-objective possibilistic mixed integer programming model to deal with such issues. The proposed model integrates the network design decisions in both forward and reverse supply chain networks, and also incorporates the strategic network design decisions along with tactical material flow ones to avoid the sub-optimalities led from separated design in both parts. To solve the proposed possibilistic optimization model, an interactive fuzzy solution approach is developed by combining a number of efficient solution approaches from the recent literature.

First, a low-pass lumped-element ladder network is considered. Then the series inductors are replaced with commensurate transmission lines. As a result, a practically important mixed-element structure is obtained. Then the description of the structure by means of two frequency variables (one for shunt capacitors and one for transmission lines) is detailed: Explicit expressions for the coefficients of the descriptive two-variable polynomials in terms of the coefficients of the single variable boundary polynomials are derived for various numbers of elements, which are obtained first time in the literature. Finally, a mixed-element broadband matching network is designed to illustrate the usage of the obtained expressions. If it is preferred not to have shunt capacitors, they can be replaced with open-ended stubs via Richard's transformation. So the resultant circuit is extremely suitable for microstrip fabrication.

Prediction of strength of reinforced lightweight soil using an artificial neural network	ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS												Purpose - Reinforced lightweight soil (RLS) consisting of dredged soil, cement, air-foam, and waste fishing net is considered to be an eco-friendly backfilling material because it provides a means to recycle both dredged soil and waste fishing net. It may be difficult to find an optimum mixing ratio of RLS considering the design criteria and the construction's situation using the limited test results because the unconfined compressive strength is complicatedly influenced by various mixing ratios of admixtures. As a result, in order to expedite the field application of RLS, an appropriate prediction method is needed. The paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model that was based on experimental test results performed on various mixing ratios, was developed to predict the unconfined compressive strength of RLS. Findings - It was found that the unconfined compressive strength of RLS at a given mixing ratio could be reasonably estimated using the developed neural network model. In addition, sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the effect of mixing conditions on the compressive strength of RLS. Practical implications - RLS is considered to be environmentally friendly because it provides a means to recycle both dredged soil and waste fishing net. The contractors could use the proposed ANN model as an alternative method to predict the strength of RLS with a specific mixing ratio. Originality/value - This paper reveals that the developed ANN model can be served as a simple and reliable predictive tool for the strength of RLS without excessive laboratory tests for various admixture contents. An optimum admixture ratio of composed materials to get a designed strength could be easily found by using the proposed ANN model.																			0264-4401	1758-7077					2011	28	5-6					600	615		10.1108/02644401111141037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02644401111141037													WOS:000294835300005

However, due to its topology particularities, this paradigm represents a challenge for physical cell design, especially concerning the transistor placement procedure. In this scenario, we present an analysis of two divergent placement strategies: the first based on a continuous active area approach, aiming to produce cells with minimized diffusion gaps, and the second based on a continuous polysilicon gates paradigm, where the target is to maximize the vertical gates alignment. In order to evaluate both placement policies regarding geometrical and electrical aspects, we performed experiments in a well-known benchmark. The continuous polysilicon gates strategy presented optimizations in the cell area, wirelength, input capacitance, leakage, internal and switching power, while the continuous active area strategy showed better results concerning propagation and transition delay. These results can be used as a guide to an adaptive placement methodology implemented in automatic layout design tools to deal with non-series-parallel arrangements.

Current ends in Parallel Computation and the Implications for Modeling and Optimization	10TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING	Computer Aided Chemical Engineering				10th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering	AUG 16-20, 2009	Salvador, BRAZIL					Process Systems Engineering (PSE) is built on the application of computational tools to the solution of physical engineering problems. Over the course of its nearly five decade history, advances in PSE have relied roughly equally on advancements in desktop computing technology and developments of new tools and approaches for representing and solving problems (Westerberg, 2004). Just as desktop computing development over that period focused on increasing the net serial instruction rate, tool development in PSE has emphasized creating faster general-purpose serial algorithms. However, in recent years the increase in net serial instruction rate has slowed dramatically, with processors first reaching an effective upper limit for clock speed and now approaching apparent limits for microarchitecture efficiency. Current trends in desktop processor development suggest that future performance gains will occur primarily through exploitation of parallelism. For PSE to continue to leverage the "free" advancements from desktop computing technology in the future, the PSE toolset will need to embrace the use of parallelization. Unfortunately, "parallelization" is more than just identifying multiple things to do at once. Parallel algorithm design has two fundamental challenges: first, to match the characteristics of the parallelizable problem workload to the capabilities of the hardware platform, and second to properly balance parallel computation with the overhead of communication and synchronization on that platform. The performance of any parallel algorithm is thus a strong function of how well the characteristics of the problem and algorithm match those of the hardware platform on which it will run. This has led to a proliferation of highly specialized parallel hardware platforms, each designed around specific problems or problem classes. While every platform has its own unique characteristics, we can group current approaches into six basic classes: symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), networks of workstations (NOW), massively parallel processing (MPP), specialized coprocessors, multi-threaded shared memory, and hybrids that combine components of the first five classes. Perhaps the most familiar of these is the SMP architecture, which forms the bulk of current the desktop and workstation market. These systems have multiple processing units (processors and/or cores) controlled by a single operating system image and sharing a single common shared memory space. While SMP systems provide only a modest level of parallelism (typically 2-16 processing units), the existence of shared memory and full-featured processing units makes them perhaps the most straightforward development platform. A challenge of SMP platforms is the discrepancy between the speed of the processor and the memory system: both latency and overall memory bandwidth limitations can lead to processors idling waiting for data. Clusters, a generic term for coordinated groups of independent computers (nodes) connected with high-speed networks, provide the opportunity for a radically different level of parallelism, with the largest clusters having over 25,000 nodes and 100,000 processing units. The challenge with clusters is memory is distributed across independent nodes. Communication and coordination among nodes must be explicitly managed and occurs over a relatively high latency network interconnect. Efficient use of this architecture requires applications that decompose into pseudo-independent components that run with high computation to communication ratios. The level to which systems utilize commodity components distinguishes the two main types of cluster architectures, with NOW nodes running commodity network interconnects and operating systems and MPP nodes using specialized or proprietary network layers or microkernels. Specialized coprocessors, including graphics processing units (GPU) and the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell), are gaining popularity as scientific computing platforms. These platforms employ non-general purpose dependent processing units to speed fine-grained, repetitive processing. Architecturally, they are reminiscent of vector computing, combining very fast access to a small amount of local memory with processing elements implementing either a single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) (GPU) or a pipelined (Cell) model. As application developers must explicitly manage both parallelism on the coprocessor and the movement of data to and from the coprocessor memory space, these architectures can be some of the most challenging to program. Finally, multi-threaded shared memory (MTSM) systems represent a fundamental departure from traditional distributed memory systems like NOW and MPP. Instead of a collection of independent nodes and memory spaces, an MTSM system runs a single system image across all nodes, combining all node memory into a single coherent shared memory space. To a developer, the MTSM appears to be a single very large SMP. However, unlike a SMP that uses caches to reduce the latency of a memory access, the MTSM tolerates latency by using a large number of concurrent threads. While this architecture lends itself to problems that are not readily decomposable, effective utilization of MTSM systems requires applications to run hundreds - or thousands - of concurrent threads. The proliferation of specialized parallel computing architectures presents several significant challenges for developers of parallel modeling and optimization applications. Foremost is the challenge of selecting the "appropriate" platform to target when developing the application. While it is clear that architectural characteristics can significantly affect the performance of an algorithm, relatively few rules or heuristics exist for selecting a platform based solely on application characteristics. A contributing challenge is that different architectures employ fundamentally different programming paradigms, libraries, and tools. Knowledge and experience on one platform does not necessarily translate to other platforms. This also complicates the process of directly comparing platform performance, as applications are rarely portable: software designed for one platform rarely compiles on another without modification, and the modifications may require a redesign of the fundamental parallelization approach. A final challenge is effectively communicating parallel results. While the relatively homogenous environment of serial desktop computing facilitated extremely terse descriptions of a test platform, often limited to processor make and clock speed, reporting results for parallel architectures must include not only processor information, but depending on the architecture, also include operating system, network interconnect, coprocessor make, model, and interconnect, and node configuration. There are numerous examples of algorithms and applications designed explicitly to leverage specific architectural features of parallel systems. While by no means comprehensive, three current representative efforts are the development of parallel branch and bound algorithms, distributed collaborative optimization algorithms, and multithreaded parallel discrete event simulation. PICO, the Parallel Integer and Combinatorial Optimizer (Eckstein, et al., 2001), is a scalable parallel mixed-integer linear optimizer. Designed explicitly for cluster environments (both NOW and MPP), PICO leverages the synergy between the inherently decomposable branch and bound tree search and the independent nature of the nodes within a cluster by distributing the independent sub-problems for the tree search across the nodes of the cluster. In contrast, agent-based collaborative optimization (Siirola, et al., 2004, 2007) matches traditionally non-decomposable nonlinear programming algorithms to high-latency clusters (e.g. NOWs or Grids) by replicating serial search algorithms intact and unmodified across the independent nodes of the cluster. The system then enforces collaboration through sharing intermediate "solutions" to the common problem. This creates a decomposable artificial meta-algorithm with a high computation to communication ratio that can scale efficiently on large, high latency, low bandwidth cluster environments. For modeling applications, efficiently parallelizing discrete event simulations has presented a longstanding challenge, with several decades of study and literature (Perumalla, 2006). The central challenge in parallelizing discrete event simulations on traditional distributed memory clusters is efficiently synchronizing the simulation time across the processing nodes during a simulation. A promising alternative approach leverages the Cray XMT (formerly called Eldorado; Feo, et al. 2005). The XMT implements an MTSM architecture and provides a single shared memory space across all nodes, greatly simplifying the time synchronization challenge. Further, the fine-grained parallelism provided by the architecture opens new opportunities for additional parallelism beyond simple event parallelization, for example, parallelizing the event queue management. While these three examples are a small subset of current parallel algorithm design, they demonstrate the impact that parallel architectures have had and will continue to have on future developments for modeling and optimization in PSE.																			1570-7946		978-0-444-53472-9				2009	27						139	141																WOS:000287727800025

This study considers competition between the government and the private firm while determining toll pricing scheme and credits charging scheme in the public-private mixed road network under the elastic origin-destination (O-D) demand case. The private firm maximizes its profit via pricing tolls on its controlled roads (private roads for short) while the government maximizes its total social gains via charging credits on its controlled roads (public roads for short). It is formulated as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). To measure the inefficiency of EPEC, total social welfare is used by optimizing the sum of their objective functions as a system optimum (SO) model. Subsequently, a diagonalization method is used to solve the models. Numerical experiments are conducted on in two typical networks. The experiment with the small network demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed EPEC model. The Sioux Falls network example illustrates the competition between the government and the private firm when operating the public-private mixed network via determining the charging credits scheme and pricing tolls scheme. Moreover, EPEC is less inefficient because the EPEC lowers the sum of the objective function values of the government and private firms compared with that of SO where the sum of their objective functions is maximized.

However, their incorporation in urban road networks is complex, since legal, social, and technical considerations often arise with respect to their usage. As official regulatory frameworks are often lacking, micromobility operators typically devise ad hoc geofences to create virtual geographic boundaries, restricting parking or access for users. In this context, this paper proposes a methodological tool for assisting decision-making in regulating escooter usage in urban areas. A service network design model is introduced for that purpose, aiming to maximize the extent of geofences in an urban area for the sake of maximizing road safety, while considering travel time impacts for users. The problem is formulated as a bi-level biobjective optimization model and solved using a Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, NSGA-II. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis regarding the design criteria is performed and results are discussed.

A pi-design prototype is evaluated for tunable networks in a load-pull investigation at 0.9 GHz, 1.3 GHz, and 2.0 GHz. It is shown that the individual GaN-cell BST networks can handle more than 2 W output power but the network losses reduce the drain efficiency by 10 ... 35 percentage points. The BST losses are found to be extremely frequency dependant under power operation but the linearity of the device is dominated by the non-linearity of the transistor itself. Present limitations and development areas of this novel concept are discussed in the work.

It is first shown that the delay variation gives rise to a discrete-time uncertain NCS model; robust stability analysis is carried out via a linear matrix inequality approach which, when combined with a directed parameter search, yields an estimate of robust stability bounds against any variations of the maximum allowable delay (constrained within one sampling period) that the closed-loop system can tolerate. The derived bounds are compared with other techniques relying on the singular values of the perturbed NCS-model. The presented simulation results prove the efficacy of the proposed control scheme.

The considered system has the actuator and the sensor in different nodes separated by a network. The strategy consists in minimizing the use of the network by only transmitting data from the observer to the controller and from the controller to the actuator when a trigger is generated by an event-trigger function. Based on the Lyapunov theory, conditions for the stability of the closed-loop system in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived. Convex optimization problems are provided to tune the proposed trigger functions aiming at reducing the usage of the network.

To fill this gap, a Spatial and Temporal Weighted Continuous Deep Neural Network (STWC-DNN) was proposed. For STWC-DNN, three sub-networks, Single Pixel Network (SPN), Multiple Station Network (MSN), and Continuous Region Network (CRN) were designed to analyze the influence of predictor variables at the prediction position, the influence of PM2.5 concentrations from surrounding stations, and the influence of continuous raster predictor variables from surrounding pixels respectively. STWC-DNN was experimented using hourly Himawari AOD data and the outputs were compared with a series of advanced models. STWC-DNN achieved higher accuracy than existing models and the sample-based, time-based, and station-based 10-fold cross-validation (CV) R-2 were 0.92, 0.90, and 0.79, respectively. The principle of establishing STWC-DNN sheds useful lights on the effective use of raster predictor variables and automatic spatiotemporal weight function to better estimate PM2.5 and other airborne pollutants based on multiple data sources.

Compared with the actual implementation (testbeds), simulation has become a valuable tool, which allows studying large scale systems that cannot be built practically. However, most simulators currently used for such networks are intended to evaluate individual routing protocol, which should be extracted from the source code and rewritten in accordance with the simulator's requirements. Thus, in this paper, we design a new wireless ad-hoc network simulator, called Time Step-based Wireless Ad-hoc Network Simulator (TimSim). It is intended to facilitate the migration of simulation code to real devices via providing useful APIs with real device driver. We use a discrete event processor with time step-based feature as the simulating engine, and the data can be transmitted in bit-level. A unique feature of TimSim is its ability to support the simulation of multi-thread programming. Additionally, we import database access to store the simulation information. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of TimSim. Furthermore, a case study on a real system has been presented to illustrate its practicability.																			2233-7857					APR	2016	9	4					301	313		10.14257/ijfgcn.2016.9.4.27	http://dx.doi.org/10.14257/ijfgcn.2016.9.4.27													WOS:000376567900027

First, we show how an attack on a single node snowballs into a network-wide attack and even destabilizes the entire system. Next, to overcome the adversarial effects of attacks on sensors and actuators, a distributed adaptive attack compensator is designed by estimating the normal expected behavior of agents. The adaptive attack compensator is augmented with the controller and it is shown that the proposed controller achieves secure consensus in the presence of the attacks on sensors and actuators. No restrictive assumption on the number of agents under adversarial input is assumed. Moreover, it recovers compromised agents under actuator attacks and avoids propagation of attacks on sensors without discarding information from the compromised agents. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the presented theoretical contributions on a network of Sentry autonomous underwater vehicles.

The proposed method is based on one of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks, Wave-U-Net, which successively down-samples and up-samples feature maps. We find that this architecture resembles that of multiresolution analysis, and reveal that the DS layers of Wave-U-Net cause aliasing and may discard information useful for the separation. Although the effects of these problems may be reduced by training, to achieve a more reliable source separation method, we should design DS layers capable of overcoming the problems. With this belief, focusing on the fact that the DWT has an anti-aliasing filter and the perfect reconstruction property, we design the proposed layers. Experiments on music source separation show the efficacy of the proposed method and the importance of simultaneously considering the anti-aliasing filters and the perfect reconstruction property.

The considered systems are endowed with the following two main features: (i) cross-correlated stochastic matrices involved in the state and observation equations are assumed and (ii) the process and observation noises have cross-correlation at the same time instant. A decorrelation framework is established to reconstruct such systems. With the equivalent transformation of original dynamic systems resulting from decorrelating operations, the optimal linear recursive filter in the minimum mean square error sense is developed by employing the results of Kalman filtering. The discrete-time linear systems with multiple packet dropouts are modelled as a particular case, and then the proposed filter is applied directly to estimate the system state, while a comparative analysis between the new method and the existing approaches is provided. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				DEC 15	2017	11	18					3353	3362		10.1049/iet-cta.2017.0425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2017.0425													WOS:000419019400015

However, in a hostile environment, the adversary could fabricate false temporal variation patterns of the aggregates by manipulating a series of aggregation results through compromised nodes. Existing secure aggregation schemes conduct one individual verification for each aggregation result, which could incur great accumulative communication cost and negative impact on transmission scheduling for continuous aggregation. In this paper, we identify distinct design issues for protecting continuous in-network aggregation and propose a novel scheme to detect false temporal variation patterns. Compared with the existing schemes, our scheme greatly reduces the verification cost by checking only a small part of aggregation results to verify the correctness of the temporal variation patterns in a time window. A sampling-based approach is used to check the aggregation results, which enables our scheme independent of any particular in-network aggregation protocols as opposed to existing schemes. We also propose a series of security mechanisms to protect the sampling process. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.

The model is based on a grid road network where roads are classified into three types: access roads, minor arterial roads, and major arterial roads. Using a continuous approximation in which the distance is measured as the rectilinear distance, we obtain a simple approximation for the total travel time. We then find the optimal allocation of area taken up by roads at each level of the hierarchy so as to minimize the sum of the travel and construction costs. The result demonstrates how the total traffic volume, the traffic composition, and the unit construction cost affect the optimal road area. The optimal area of major arterial roads increases with the total traffic volume and the proportions of inward, outward, and through traffic and decreases with the unit construction cost.																			0570-1864	1432-0592				SEP	2014	53	2			SI		617	630		10.1007/s00168-014-0635-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00168-014-0635-z													WOS:000345009300013

To this goal, network modelling and simulation methodologies are the most critical issues, thus, several Discrete Event Simulation (DES) schemes have been introduced in the literature. In a real wireless network, services such as new call admission, reallocation, etc, should be offered at the same time for different mobile users in the network coverage area. Thus, the network modelling must be based on the network operational concurrency and services independence. The simulation model adaptation to real network behaviour is a challenging goal. Herein, a novel simulation methodology based on multi-threading for simulating wireless networks, compared to the state of the art approach, is presented, preliminarily analyzed and discussed. Moreover, various implementations based on multi-threading and multi-agent concepts are also presented and evaluated.

The modularity of the genetic regulatory network computational paradigm in terms of isolating its search algorithm, the regulatory network simulation and the cell simulation, allowed this improvement to largely focus upon cell simulation. This indicates a robustness property of the paradigm's design. As well, wind farm layout optimization highlights how developmental models can be considered more efficient than other optimization methods because of their "optimize once, use-many" adaptability.

In the considered power model, several antenna subsets are constrained by sum power constraints while the other antennas are subject to per-antenna power constraints. This kind of transceiver designs includes both the transceiver designs under sum power constraint and per-antenna power constraint as its special cases. This kind of designs is of critical importance for distributed antenna systems (DASs) with heterogeneous remote radio heads (RRHs) such as cloud radio access networks (C-RANs). In our work, we try to solve the optimization problem in an analytical way instead of using some famous software packages e.g., CVX or SeDuMi. In our work, to strike tradeoffs between performance and complexity, both iterative and non-iterative solutions are proposed. Interestingly the non-iterative solution can be interpreted as a matrix-version water-filling solution extended from the well-known and extensively studied vector version. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical results.

J	Yang, DN; Chen, MS				Yang, De-Nian; Chen, Ming-Syan			On bandwidth-efficient data broadcast	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING												In this paper, we leverage network coding (NC) to reduce the bandwidth consumption for data broadcast (DB). We use the concept of mixing in a different way from the traditional NC. Traditional NC mixes all data items together. However, we mix each data item from only some data items according to the queried and stored data of receivers. Therefore, each receiver in our approach is required to receive fewer coded data to decode the required information, and the sender, thereby, is able to broadcast fewer data items. We formulate an optimization problem with integer-linear programming to minimize the bandwidth consumption in DB. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and design an approximation algorithm that can be implemented in the data server. In addition, we show that different mixings of data items lead to different decoding costs for receivers. We design an algorithm to optimally code the data items with the minimum decoding cost.

By using the method of variation of parameters and introducing notions of uniform and weak uniform M-matrix, the estimates for 3 kinds of IS-e are derived for time-varying DDSs. The exponential ISS conditions with parts suitable for infinite delays are thus established, by which the difference from the time-invariant case is shown. The exponential stability of a time-varying DDS with zero external input cannot guarantee its ISS. Moreover, based on the IS-e estimates for DDSs, the exponential ISS under events criteria for DDSs with impulsive effects are obtained. The results are then applied in 1 example to test synchronization in the sense of ISS for a delayed discrete-time network, where the impulsive control is designed to stabilize such an asynchronous network to the synchronization.

J	Cai, ZQ; Chen, JS; Liu, M				Cai, Zhiqiang; Chen, Jingshuang; Liu, Min			Least-squares neural network (LSNN) method for scalar nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws: Discrete divergence operator	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												A least-squares neural network (LSNN) method was introduced for solving scalar linear and nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws (HCLs) in Cai et al. (2021, 2022). This method is based on an equivalent least-squares (LS) formulation and uses ReLU neural network as approximating functions, making it ideal for approximating discontinuous functions with unknown interface location. In the design of the LSNN method for HCLs, the numerical approximation of differential operators is a critical factor, and standard numerical or automatic differentiation along coordinate directions can often lead to a failed NN-based method. To overcome this challenge, this paper rewrites HCLs in their divergence form of space and time and introduces a new discrete divergence operator. As a result, the proposed LSNN method is free of penalization of artificial viscosity. Theoretically, the accuracy of the discrete divergence operator is estimated even for discontinuous solutions. Numerically, the LSNN method with the new discrete divergence operator was tested for several benchmark problems with both convex and non-convex fluxes, and was able to compute the correct physical solution for problems with rarefaction, shock or compound waves. The method is capable of capturing the shock of the underlying problem without oscillation or smearing, even without any penalization of the entropy condition, total variation, and/or artificial viscosity.

The filter and the system are connected via a communication network, and the transmitted information of system output and switching signal is determined by an event-triggered transmission scheme, which contains system mode dependent parameters. Consequently, the asynchronous switching between the filter and the system occurs, and the filtering error system is modeled as a switched system with augmented switching signal by using the merging switching signal technique. Then, by the multiple Lyapunov function method, a new sufficient condition is obtained such that the filtering error system is exponentially asymptotically stable and satisfies the weighted H-infinity performance. Finally, the design method for the filter and event-triggered parameters is proposed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2018 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, MC				Chen, Ming-Chih			A New 8-Bit AES Design for Wireless Network Applications	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES												In this paper, we present a pure hardware implementation of the advanced encryption standard (AES) with 8-bit data path with both encryption/decryption abilities for applications of wireless network. To achieve the requirements of low area resource and high throughput performance, the 8-bit AES design overlaps the Mix Columns (MC) and Shift Rows (SR), Inverse Mix Columns (IMC) and Inverse Shift Rows (ISR) operations in order to reduce the required clock cycles and critical path delay of transformations involved. The combinations of SB with ISB, MC with IMC, and SR with ISR can effectively reduce the area cost of the AES realization. We implement the AES processor in an ASIC chip. The design has the area cost of 4.3 k-gates with throughput of 72 Mbps which can meet the throughput requirement of IEEE 802.11g wireless network standard. From the experimental results, we observe that our AES design has better performance compared with other previous designs.																			0916-8508	1745-1337				DEC	2013	E96A	12					2587	2596		10.1587/transfun.E96.A.2587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1587/transfun.E96.A.2587													WOS:000329006900034

Quantifying Supply Chain Trade-Offs Using Six Sigma, Simulation, and Designed Experiments to Develop a Flexible Distribution Network	QUALITY ENGINEERING												This case study quantifies the trade-off between customer service and inventory in a multinode supply chain while assessing system performance. An integrated and generalized modeling framework is used that incorporates define, measure, analyze, improve, control (DMAIC) methodology and designed experiments. Many traditional models require normality in demand and supply, but this is often not representative of reality. Therefore, this study leverages discrete-event simulation to replicate and understand the variation in a real-world supply chain at a large multinational corporation. The goal of this modeling application is to provide dynamic decision support to facilitate effective supply chain design. The study uses an innovative three-stage analytical approach to study a multiechelon distribution network. The first stage uses DMAIC to highlight areas of variability in the process, enabling identification of key high-risk inputs affecting system performance. The next stage, discrete-event simulation, utilizes DMAIC results in the development of a validated model that represents the real-world variability present in the supply chain. The third and final stage, designed experiments, is used to analyze the simulation output and quantify the factors that drive supply chain performance, specifically inventory levels and customer service (fill rate) at various stages of the supply chain. To more effectively respond to stochastic behavior of customers, study results impact decision making and facilitate inventory replenishment policy changes. The analysis also helped in the proper allocation of resources to manage the various stock-keeping units (SKU) classes and customer categories. This proactive modeling approach is robust and readily replicated in any supply chain.																			0898-2112	1532-4222					2011	23	2					180	203		10.1080/08982112.2010.529481	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08982112.2010.529481													WOS:000299335400007

Reusing effluents for heating purposes or reducing resource consumption can lead to substantial operating costs savings if the capital investments required to implement recovery networks are depreciated over an adequate period of time. This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming model to design mass allocation and heat exchanger networks simultaneously. Mass streams are characterized by their composition and properties. A superstructure is presented to define the interactions between mass allocation and heat exchanger networks. Non-isothermal mixing can occur before and after the heat exchanger network. The objective function is the total annualized costs of both networks. It takes into account the annual operating costs for energy and mass requirements and the capital costs of the heat exchanger network.

In addition to combining these designs, a foliated transport network requires a high level of dynamic planning and control, as well as optimisation of goods and resources between the different network layers. It highlights the advantages of individual transport network designs and minimizes their weaknesses, ultimately leading to better performance of the foliated system than the individual options. The purpose of this paper is to describe the basic models of the freight transport network and the benefits of connecting these models.

However, many neural networks utilized in real applications often have a sparse connectivity, which is hard to be efficiently mapped to a crossbar structure. Moreover, the scale of the neural networks is normally much larger than that can be offered by the latest integration technology of memristor crossbars. In this work, we propose AutoNCS - an EDA framework that can automate the NCS designs that combine memristor crossbars and discrete synapse modules. The connections of the neural networks are clustered to improve the utilization of the memristor elements in crossbar structures by taking into account the physical design cost of the NCS. Our results show that AutoNCS can substantially enhance the utilization efficiency of memristor crossbars while reducing the wirelength, area and delay of the physical designs of the NCS.

J	Suk, HI; Sin, BK; Lee, SW				Suk, Heung-Il; Sin, Bong-Kee; Lee, Seong-Whan			Hand gesture recognition based on dynamic Bayesian network framework	PATTERN RECOGNITION												In this paper, we propose a new method for recognizing hand gestures in a continuous video stream using a dynamic Bayesian network or DBN model. The proposed method of DBN-based inference is preceded by steps of skin extraction and modelling, and motion tracking. Then we develop a gesture model for one- or two-hand gestures. They are used to define a cyclic gesture network for modeling continuous gesture stream. We have also developed a DP-based real-time decoding algorithm for continuous gesture recognition. In our experiments with 10 isolated gestures, we obtained a recognition rate upwards of 99.59% with cross validation. In the case of recognizing continuous stream of gestures, it recorded 84% with the precision of 80.77% for the spotted gestures. The proposed DBN-based hand gesture model and the design of a gesture network model are believed to have a strong potential for successful applications to other related problems such as sign language recognition although it is a bit more complicated requiring analysis of hand shapes.

In recent years, the application of consolidation-based service network design in the express service has attracted lots of academic attention due to the rapid growth of the express industry. This paper studies the consolidation-based service network design problem, which jointly determines the commodity flow, vehicle dispatching, and fleet sizing. We propose a mixed-integer optimization model to address the problem and design an efficient iterative backbone algorithm to solve large-scale real-world problems. The numerical results of large-scale instances confirmed that the solution obtained by our proposed algorithm is better than that of the primal model, and the running time taken is less than half that of the general solution approach.

A judicious selection of training data can be tremendously difficult due to the presence of subpixel targets and mixed pixels, particularly, when no prior knowledge is available. Surprisingly, the above issues have been largely overlooked in the past, where most of the efforts have been focused on exploring network architecture parameters such as the arrangement and number of neurons in the different layers. Very little has been done in regard to the selection of a set of good training samples for networks in mixed pixel classification. This paper revisits neural network-based mixed pixel classification from an aspect of training sample generation and further demonstrates that the selection of training samples can be more important than the choice of a specific network architecture. Since the training samples must be obtained directly from the data to be processed in an unsupervised fashion, four types of pixels: pure pixel, mixed pixel, anomalous pixel and homogeneous pixel are used to demonstrate this concept. A pure pixel is a pixel whose spectral signature is completely represented by a single material substance as opposed to a mixed pixel whose spectral signature is made up of more than one material substance. A homogeneous pixel is defined as a pixel whose spectral signature remains nearly constant subject to small variations within its surroundings. Therefore, a homogeneous pixel can be considered as an opposite of an anomalous pixel whose signature is spectrally distinct from the signatures of its neighboring pixels. In this paper, various scenarios are designed for experiments to substantiate the impact of using these four types of pixels as training samples for mixed pixel classification.

Satellite images are extremely numerous, continuous, high resolution, and accessible, allowing nuanced experimentation through dataset curation. Combining deep learning with remote-sensing technologies, this study poses the following questions. Do newly available datasets uncover ideas about the city previously hidden because urban theory is predominantly Eurocentric? Do extensive and continuous datasets promise a more refined examination of datasets' effects on outcomes? Generative adversarial networks can endlessly generate new designs based on a curated dataset, but architectural evaluation has been questionable. We employ quantitative and qualitative assessment metrics to investigate human collaboration with AI, producing results that contribute to understanding AI-based urban design models and the significance of dataset curation.

The problem considers deterministic demand by multiple clients, for multiple products, over the periods of a long-term horizon. The design decisions involve selection of suppliers, establishment or resizing of production facilities and distribution centres, possible subcontracting of related activities, and selection of transportation modes and routes. The problem is formulated by a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model. Its objective is to minimise the overall costs associated with procurement, production, inventory, warehousing, and transportation over the design horizon. Appropriate constraints model the complex relationships among the links of the supply chain. The proposed model has been applied to a large case study of a global manufacturing firm, providing valuable insights into the transformation of the firm's current supply chain network, as well as into the potential of the proposed approach.																			0020-7543	1366-588X				MAR 4	2019	57	5					1371	1397		10.1080/00207543.2018.1489155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2018.1489155													WOS:000461896100007

We demonstrate first how to directly embed neural network evaluation into optimization models, highlight a difficulty with this approach that can prevent convergence, and then characterize stationarity of such models. We then present two alternative formulations of these problems in the specific case of feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation: as a mixed-integer optimization problem and as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. For the latter formulation we prove that stationarity at a point for this problem corresponds to stationarity of the embedded formulation. Each of these formulations may be solved with state-of-the-art optimization methods, and we show how to obtain good initial feasible solutions for these methods. We compare our formulations on three practical applications arising in the design and control of combustion engines, in the generation of adversarial attacks on classifier networks, and in the determination of optimal flows in an oil well network.

J	De Corte, A; Sörensen, K				De Corte, Annelies; Soerensen, Kenneth			Optimisation of gravity-fed water distribution network design: A critical review	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												This paper surveys the literature on the optimisation of water distribution network design. The water distribution network design (WDND) optimisation problem entails finding the material and diameter of each pipe in the network so that the total cost of the network is minimised without violating any hydraulic constraints. This is a difficult combinatorial optimisation problem, in which decision variables are discrete and both cost function and constraints are non-linear. Over the past 30 years, a large number of methods, especially in the field of (meta) heuristics, have been developed to solve this problem, most of which obtain good results on the available benchmark networks. In addition to outlining the basic features of each method, a detailed computational comparison is presented. Based on this comparison, some issues with the current state of the art in this domain are discussed, and some future research directions are suggested. Additionally, the need for an adequate set of benchmark instances is motivated, and the minimal requirements for an instance set generator are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a novel power-type varying gain discrete-time recurrent neural network (PVG-DTRNN) is proposed to solve the TVLS problem. Compared with the state-of-art method, i.e., the fixed-parameter discrete-time zeroing neural network (FP-DTZNN), the proposed PVG-DTRNN has better convergent rate and higher accuracy. To do so, a vector error function is firstly defined. Secondly, a power-type gain implicit dynamic model is derived and needs to be further discretized. Thirdly, by using Euler forward-difference rule, a discretized dynamic model is designed. In order to get the explicit dynamic model, the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton method is utilized to estimate the inverse of the Hessian matrix. Comparisons of computer simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PVG-DTRNN models. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Congestion is more difficult to detect in wireless communications, as the network delays and the number of users change constantly. This paper presents the design and test in different environments of four different pole placement controllers. Each of them represents a unique way of dealing with congestion: the way in which delay is introduced in the design or if the design is continuous or digital influence heavily in the results. Simulations in realistic non-linear environments show that the pole placement controllers are a viable approach to reduce congestion in networks.

The hub location and network design problem with fixed and variable arc costs: formulation and dual-based solution heuristic	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY												Many air, less-than-truck load and intermodal transportation and telecommunication networks incorporate hubs in an effort to reduce total cost. These hubs function as make bulk/break bulk or consolidation/deconsolidation centres. In this paper, a new hub location and network design formulation is presented that considers the fixed costs of establishing the hubs and the arcs in the network, and the variable costs associated with the demands on the arcs. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem embedding a multi-commodity flow model. The formulation can be transformed into some previously modelled hub network design problems. We develop a dual-based heuristic that exploits the multi-commodity flow problem structure embedded in the formulation. The test results indicate that the heuristic is an effective way to solve this computationally complex problem.																			0160-5682	1476-9360				JAN	2008	59	1					80	89		10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602307													WOS:000251652400009

Poorly planned network access parameters, such as channel assignments or cell identifying codes, result in increased interference on system-critical control channels, network access failures, and poor quality of service. Therefore, the optimization of such network parameters is a vital task for self-organizing wireless networks. This paper considers Long-Term Evolution (LTE) systems and identifies a number of network parameter optimization problems encountered when designing self-organizing wireless access networks. A Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) optimization model is proposed for each problem. The optimization of frequency channel assignments, Tracking Area Codes, Physical Cell Identifiers, and LTE coordination clusters is discussed and modeled in detail. Simulation results demonstrate significant network quality gains from optimizing network parameters using the proposed integer optimization models.																			1550-3607		978-1-4673-8999-0				2017																								WOS:000424872100156

Quality Prediction of Continuous Ultrasonic Welded Seams of High-Performance Thermoplastic Composites by means of Artificial Intelligence	FAIM 2021	Procedia Manufacturing				30th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing (FAIM)	JUN 15-18, 2021	Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Athens, GREECE		Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn			Thermoplastic composites (TCs) are a famous choice when it comes to high performance designs for industrial applications. Since the growing demand on the use of this material, it is important to be able to evaluate suitable processing technologies. One of those technologies is continuous ultrasonic welding (CUSW) which creates continuous joints, also called seams, between two or more TCs parts. In CUSW mechanical oscillations are applied to the material and result in melting and connecting of the welding parts. The approach to predict joint strength (qualities) of continuous ultrasonic welded TCs by training different neural networks is investigated in this study. Quality class prediction around 72 % accuracy is achieved with a fully connected neural network. Concluding, quality prediction of welded TCs with the help of artificial intelligence seems to be a suitable approach for quality observation but more research could lead to more reliable neural networks for industrial applications.

LOICA: Integrating Models with Data for Genetic Network Design Automation	ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY												Genetic design automation tools are necessary to expand the scale and complexity of possible synthetic genetic networks. These tools are enabled by abstraction of a hierarchy of standardized components and devices. Abstracted elements must be parametrized from data derived from relevant experiments, and these experiments must be related to the part composition of the abstract components. Here we present Logical Operators for Integrated Cell Algorithms (LOICA), a Python package for designing, modeling, and characterizing genetic networks based on a simple object-oriented design abstraction. LOICA uses classes to represent different biological and experimental components, which generate models through their interactions. These models can be parametrized by direct connection to data contained in Flapjack so that abstracted components of designs can characterize themselves. Models can be simulated using continuous or stochastic methods and the data published and managed using Flapjack. LOICA also outputs SBOL3 descriptions and generates graph representations of genetic network designs.

An alternative approach to the delayed force feedback is to design a virtual environment (VE) on the master side that duplicates the essential features of the remote slave- environment interconnection. In this work, we present an approach to the design of VE- enhanced force reflecting teleoperation in presence of network induced communication constraints. The approach is based on using an approximate discrete- time model of the remote slave/environment interconnection, which is implemented on the master side together with certain observation/identification/prediction mechanism that allows to approximately recover the current state/parameters of the remote environment based on delayed and possibly distorted measurement data. A control algorithm and a communication protocol are designed which guarantee the stability of the overall teleoperator system in the presence of network induced communication constraints if the loss of the information during communication is sufficiently small.

Hybrid Multi-swarm Optimization based NoC Synthesis	2017 30TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM-ON-CHIP CONFERENCE (SOCC)					30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)	SEP 05-08, 2017	Munich, GERMANY	IEEE, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc				Network-on-Chip (NoC) has been proposed as an interconnection framework for connecting large number of cores for a System-on-Chip (SoC). Assuming a mesh-based NoC, we explore the assignment of cores to cross-points and produce a best NoC configuration with minimum average communication traffic, power consumption and chip area. We use pre-synthesized network components data to estimate power and chip area of the NoC. NoC configuration and mapping problem belongs to NP hard complexity set, therefore we propose a hybrid scheme of swarm optimization that combines Tabu-search, force-directed swapping, sub-swarms, and Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO). The main goal of the optimization is to configure the NoC such that the total NoC latency, power consumption, and area occupied are minimal. DPSO is used as the main optimization scheme and modified so that each particle move is also influenced by a force derived from the NoC traffic matrix. The methodology is tested for some multimedia application core graphs as well as large network of randomly generated cores. It is determined that on average our hybrid technique required less number of iterations and time to reach an optimal solution when compared with existing NoC synthesis algorithms.

We show that the network design problem to distribute the commodities in both product categories can be formulated as the uncapacitated facility location problem with monotone submodular costs and tackled using a cutting plane algorithm. We propose a strongly polynomial time algorithm for the nonlinear discrete optimization problem, which must be solved in each iteration of the cutting plane algorithm. We also provide the computational results, and summarize the insights based on the proposed model and the solution algorithm.

In this paper, the autopilot for BTT missile is designed as a two-loop feedback control structure. The inner loop feedback controller is designed using LQR control approach to contain the system uncertainty within a certain limit. The outer loop controller is designed using mixed sensitivity H-infinity optimization to deal with the disturbance and model uncertainty. Then simulation experiments of target interception are performed using BTT missile with the designed autopilot under six degrees of freedom. The results demonstrate that the designed autopilot for BTT missile is effective.

Some random variables governed by the Bernoulli distribution are used to model the missing measurements phenomenon of each sensor node. In addition, the stochastic uncertainties are characterized by the multiplicative noises and stochastic nonlinearities. By using the variance-constrained method, an appropriate filter gain is selected to minimize the trace of the upper bound for the filter error covariance. Moreover, the resilient distributed filtering algorithm is designed and a new matrix simplification technique is introduced to deal with the sparsity of sensor networks topology. Finally, both the feasibility and effectiveness of the resilient distributed filtering algorithm are verified by a numerical simulation.

Return on investment for the deployment of new networks or transformation of legacy networks to fiber-based networks need to be maximized. One way to minimize the capital expenditure (CAPEX) costs is through automation of the network design. Not only can it reduce the time and the cost of manual design but it can also optimize the design with a minimum cost. In this paper, our network planning system based on the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach is proposed with the main focus on solving practical scenarios which are related to design constraints with clear boundaries of planning areas. Advantages of having clear boundaries from the practical point of view are discussed in detail and the model to solve this problem is provided.

Primarily, the mathematical model of the MDF continuous hot-pressing position servo system is constructed based on the dynamic equation of the hydraulic system. Then, a FGFTSMC is designed to speed up the convergence rate of the system, in which an adaptive law is used to estimate the upper bound of the unknown parameters to overcome the existing parameter perturbation of the system. In addition, an RBF neural network is introduced to approximate the external load disturbance of the system. The stability of MDF continuous hot-pressing position servo system based on the control scheme developed in this paper is proven using the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the simulation results show that the presented control scheme can effectively ensure the tracking accuracy of the system and enhance the robustness of the system.

Because it is by nature a NP-hard problem, finding an efficient and reliable solution method tailored to large sized cases of specific types is of the highest importance. To this end, we develop a hybrid method based on machine-learning and optimization. For numerical tests, we set up a highly challenging case: a nonlinear discrete bi-level problem with equilibrium constraints in transportation science, known as the discrete network design problem. The hybrid method transforms the original problem to an integer linear programing problem based on a supervised learning technique and a tractable nonlinear problem. This methodology is tested using a real dataset in which the results are found to be highly promising. For the machine learning tasks we employ MATLAB and to solve the optimization problems, we use GAMS (with CPLEX solver). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By using Bernoulli stochastic variables and a switching signal, a unified model is proposed to describe four kinds of imperfect measurements, that is, access constraints, time delays, packet dropouts, and signal quantization. We aim to design a fault detection filter (FDF) such that, for all external disturbances and imperfect measurements, the error between the residual and fault is made as small as possible. The addressed FD problem is then converted into an auxiliary H-infinity filtering problem for discrete-time stochastic switched systems with multiple time-varying delays. By applying Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach, a sufficient condition for the existence of the FDF is derived in terms of certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When these LMIs are feasible, the explicit expression of the desired FDF can also be characterized. A numerical example is exploited to show the effectiveness of the results obtained.																			1598-6446	2005-4092				APR	2012	10	2					265	274		10.1007/s12555-012-0207-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12555-012-0207-x													WOS:000302195400007

The nonlinear NCSs can be approximated by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The event-triggering communication scheme under consideration is that the current sensor data is transmitted only when the current sensor data and the previously transmitted one satisfy a certain quantitative relation. By taking the signal transmission delay into consideration, a fuzzy delay system model is established to describe the nonlinear discrete-time NCSs with event-triggering communication scheme. Attention is focused on the design of fuzzy state-feedback controller which ensures asymptotic stability of the closed-loop fuzzy systems. Linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based conditions are formulated for the existence of admissible fuzzy controller. If these conditions are feasible, a desired fuzzy controller can be readily constructed. A nonlinear mass-spring-damper mechanical system is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.																					978-1-4799-2538-4				2014							533	538																WOS:000393427700072

Deep Discrete Cross-Modal Hashing with Multiple Supervision	NEUROCOMPUTING												Deep hashing has been widely used for large-scale cross-modal retrieval benefited from the low storage cost and fast search speed. However, most existing deep supervised methods only preserve the instancepairwise relationship supervised by the semantic similarity matrix, which always inufficient heterogeneous correlation. Thus, we propose the Deep Discrete Cross-Modal Hashing with Multiple Supervision (DDCHms) to further enhance the semantic consistency of heterogeneous modalities. It improves the performance of semantic information retrieval with the joint supervision of instance-pairwise, instance labeled and class-wise similarities. Specifically, we firstly utilize the instance-pairwise similarity matrix to supervise the learning process of heterogeneous networks and it keeps the pairwise correlation from the perspective of instance-instance. Specially, we design a semantic network to fully exploit the semantic information implicated in labels, which is also used to supervise multi-modal networks on instance label level. Furthermore, we propose the class-wise hash codes to cooperate with the intrinsic label matrix as the prototypes, and it guides the hash learning and further ensures the precision and compactness of the learned hash codes. In addition, we design different discrete optimization strategies to optimize the class-wise hash codes and unified hash codes, respectively. That avoids the optimization errors and ensures the high-quality of learned hash codes. Experiments on three popular datasets indicate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of cross-modal retrieval. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis-of-Marginal-Tail-Means (ATM): A Robust Method for Discrete Black-Box Optimization	TECHNOMETRICS												We present a new method, called analysis-of-marginal-tail-means (ATM), for effective robust optimization of discrete black-box problems. ATM has important applications in many real-world engineering problems (e.g., manufacturing optimization, product design, and molecular engineering), where the objective to optimize is black-box and expensive, and the design space is inherently discrete. One weakness of existing methods is that they are not robust: these methods perform well under certain assumptions, but yield poor results when such assumptions (which are difficult to verify in black-box problems) are violated. ATM addresses this by combining both rank- and model-based optimization, via the use of marginal tail means. The trade-off between rank- and model-based optimization is tuned by first identifying important main effects and interactions from data, then finding a good compromise which best exploits additive structure. ATM provides improved robust optimization over existing methods, particularly in problems with (i) a large number of factors, (ii) unordered factors, or (iii) experimental noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ATM in simulations and in two real-world engineering problems: the first on robust parameter design of a circular piston, and the second on product family design of a thermistor network.																			0040-1706	1537-2723				OCT 2	2019	61	4					545	559		10.1080/00401706.2019.1593246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00401706.2019.1593246		JUN 2019											WOS:000475189900001

To this aim, three different architectures of the transceiver behavioral model have been implemented: They can be selected by the user to address specific requirements of intended analyses. The architectures are based on a set of behavioral models of the basic mixed-signal circuit building blocks of the transceiver. The models were implemented using the VHDL-AMS language.

The proposed model deals with major issues for supply chains; product quality and cost. These issues are usually solved separately, but in this paper, we investigate effects of product quality on supply chain design and transportation flow. A trade-off between raw material quality, its purchasing and reprocessing costs was considered. Assuming decision maker (DM) wishes to work with a supplier which serves a low quality raw material; this raw material should be in need of reprocessing. To avoid the reprocessing costs, a supplier which serves a high quality raw material should be chosen but at this time the DM has to face a high purchasing cost. A supply chain network which consists of multiple suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers and retailers is tried to be designed to accomplish aforementioned above trade-offs. The paper examines and discusses the relationship between product quality and supply chain design and offers several managerial insights.

Considering the fact that just part of sensors in the network can measure the target, the filtering algorithms of the sensors are assigned differently according to the availability to get the direct measurements. For the sensors that can directly get the measurement outputs, we call them leaders and apply Kalman filters directly; for other sensors which are called followers, weighted average strategy of neighbors' estimations is applied. The communication weights are designed on the basis of the sensors' path distances to the monitored target and one parameter. By analyzing the multiple linearly coupled discrete-time Riccati equations, sufficient parameter conditions of the convergence of the mean square estimation errors are explicitly proposed for both spanning tree and arbitrary topology, respectively.

Two neural networks are included in our design. A critic network is used to estimate the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to its inputs, and an action network is used to approximate the optimal control law. Instead of periodical sampling in the traditional DHP approach, under the event-triggered mechanism, both of the neural networks are only updated at the jump instants, and kept constant during the inter-event time. With the designed trigger threshold, the proposed DHP-based event-triggered approach can save computation time significantly while obtaining competitive control performance when comparing with those of the traditional DHP approach.

The signal is transmitted through digital channels, which means that only the sequence of finite coded data is sent to the estimator. To be specific, the observation must be encoded to certain codewords by designing a coder, and then the received codewords are decoded by the relevant decoder. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a proper coding-decoding procedure such that the estimator error is asymptotically stable across the limited capacity of the communication channel. By applying a modified uniform quantization approach, sufficient detection conditions involving the size of the coding alphabet and the coding period are obtained.

Real-Valued Discrete-Time Impulse Response Representation of Bandpass S-parameters	2016 46TH EUROPEAN MICROWAVE CONFERENCE (EUMC)	European Microwave Conference				46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)	OCT 04-06, 2016	London, ENGLAND	APS				Accurate and efficient time-domain simulation techniques for broadband microwave networks at system level are highly desirable in modern computer-aided-design (CAD) tools, because of advantages in terms of high simulation speed and the reduced requirement for full circuit-level details of the simulated networks. A method for accurate time-domain representation of bandpass S-parameters is proposed in this paper, in order to produce fast time-domain steady-state responses of broadband high-frequency linear, time-invariant systems. A real-valued discrete-time impulse response (DTIR) representation is used in the proposed method. As a result, the processes of down-conversion and up-conversion of input signals and system bandpass transfer functions normally required in bandpass analysis, can be effectively avoided. For example, the method can be used in the design of distortion cancellation circuits in full-duplex communication systems.

Users issue queries to sensors and collect sensing data. Due to the low quality sensing devices or random link failures, sensor data are often noisy. In order to increase the reliability of the query results, continuous queries are often employed. In this work we focus on continuous holistic queries like Median. Existing approaches are mainly designed for non-holistic queries like Average. However, it is not trivial to answer holistic ones due to their non-decomposable property. We first propose two schemes based on the data correlation between different rounds, with one for getting the exact answers and the other one for deriving the approximate results. We then combine the two proposed schemes into a hybrid approach, which is adaptive to the data changing speed. We evaluate this design through extensive simulations. The results show that our approach significantly reduces the traffic cost compared with previous works while maintaining the same accuracy.

J	Ning, ZK; Yu, JY; Wang, T				Ning, Zhaoke; Yu, Jinyong; Wang, Tong			Simultaneous fault detection and control for uncertain discrete-time stochastic systems with limited communication	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												In the paper, the simultaneous fault detection and control (SFDC) problem is concerned for uncertain discrete-time stochastic systems with limited communication. An integrated module with a filter and a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to achieve the desired fault detection (FD) and control objectives, simultaneously. The event-triggered technology is employed to save the network communi-cation resources, while two event detectors are utilized to decrease the amount of data transmitted from the sensor to the SFDC module and from the SFDC module to the plant. A novel method is proposed to ensure that the obtained closed-loop model is robustly stochastically stable and satisfies the desired detection and control performances. Sufficient conditions are derived to obtain the parameters of filter, controller and event detectors. Finally, the validity of the design strategy is verified by a simulation case.

C.; Sahu, Sadananda; Tiwari, Manoj Kumar			Multi objective outbound logistics network design for a manufacturing supply chain	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING												Outbound logistics network (OLN) in the downstream supply chain of a firm plays a dominant role in the success or failure of that firm. This paper proposes the design of a hybrid and flexible OLN in multi objective context. The proposed distribution network for a manufacturing supply chain consists of a set of customer zones (CZs) at known locations with known demands being served by a set of potential manufacturing plants, a set of potential central distribution centers (CDCs), and a set of potential regional distribution centers (RDCs). Three variants of a single product classified based on nature of demand are supplied to CZs through three different distribution channels. The decision variables include number of plants, CDCs, RDCs, and quantities of each variant of product delivered to CZs through a designated distribution channel. The goal is to design the network with multiple objectives so as to minimize the total cost, maximize the unit fill rates, and maximize the resource utilization of the facilities in the network. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem and a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is employed to solve the resulting NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Computational experiments conducted on randomly generated data sets are presented and analyzed showing the effectiveness of the solution algorithm for the proposed network.

This capability introduces this design approach as an effective method for the design of filters for emerging dense wavelength division multiplexing networks. The design process incorporates analysing through the transfer matrix method and the powerful discrete-time signal processing techniques. Giving an adequate overview of analysing basic optical building blocks in the Z-domain, the procedure develops to analysing any optical structure imposed by mathematical sequences. The proposal is discussed employing pole-zero diagrams, discrete-time signal processing approach including apodization techniques. The point of the discrete-time signal processing approach is that the effect of dominant optical parameters over operation is clarified through the pole-zero position. Features like number of poles, bandwidth, and position of stop-bands can be controlled using ring diameter ratio. Finally, apodization of coupling coefficients attains a filter with an FWHM of 0.3 nm.

One of the most common meanings of resilience is related to a positive idea that addresses recovery from failures. This study proposes to establish a theoretical and mathematical framework for discrete resilience that allows different systems to be quantitatively compared from this point of view. Also, a definition and a local view of the concept of resilience applicable to different characteristic measures in the field of complex networks is provided.

The existing methods for ensuring nonblocking control of modular supervisors either exploit favorable structures in the system model to guarantee the nonblocking property of modular supervisors or employ hierarchical model abstraction methods for reducing the computational complexity of designing a nonblocking coordinator. The nonblocking modular control problem is, in general, NP-hard. This study integrates supervisory control theory and a model-based deep reinforcement learning method to synthesize a nonblocking coordinator for the modular supervisors. The deep reinforcement learning method significantly reduces the computational complexity by avoiding the computation of synchronization of multiple modular supervisors and the plant models. The supervisory control function is approximated by the deep neural network instead of a large-sized finite automaton. Furthermore, the proposed model-based deep reinforcement learning method is more efficient than the standard deep Q network algorithm.

The fault signal with zero second-order difference is taken into account to reflect the sensor failures. Since the communication bandwidth in practice is constrained, the binary encoding schemes are exploited to regulate the signal transmission from the neighbouring sensors to the local fault estimator. In addition, due to the influence of channel noises, each bit might change with a small crossover probability. In the presence of sensor faults and bit errors, an upper bound for the estimation error covariance matrix is ensured and minimized at each time step via designing the gain matrices of the estimator. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by a simulation.

Our method of network reduction consists in using "steady state approximations" that do not change the number of steady states. The algorithm is designed to work at the wiring diagram level without the need to evaluate or simplify Boolean functions. Also, our implementation of the algorithm takes advantage of the sparsity typical of discrete models of biological systems. The main features of our reduction algorithm are that it works at the wiring diagram level and it preserves the number of steady states. Furthermore, the steady states of the original network can be recovered from the steady states of the reduced network; thus, all steady states are found. Also, heuristic analysis and simulations show that it runs in polynomial time. We used our results to study AND-NOT network models of gene networks and showed that our algorithm greatly simplifies steady state analysis. Furthermore, our algorithm can handle sparse AND-NOT networks with up to 1,000,000 nodes.

Several quantum network simulators have been recently developed with these goals in mind. As the size of the simulated networks increases, however, sequential execution becomes time-consuming. Parallel execution presents a suitable method for scalable simulations of large-scale quantum networks, but the unique attributes of quantum information create unexpected challenges. In this work, we identify requirements for parallel simulation of quantum networks and develop the first parallel discrete-event quantum network simulator by modifying the existing serial simulator SeQUeNCe. Our contributions include the design and development of a quantum state manager (QSM) that maintains shared quantum information distributed across multiple processes. We also optimize our parallel code by minimizing the overhead of the QSM and decreasing the amount of synchronization needed among processes. Using these techniques, we observe a speedup of 2 to 25 times when simulating a 1,024-node linear network topology using 2 to 128 processes. We also observe an efficiency greater than 0.5 for up to 32 processes in a linear network topology of the same size and with the same workload. We repeat this evaluation with a randomized workload on a caveman network. We also introduce several methods for partitioning networks by mapping them to different parallel simulation processes. We have released the parallel SeQUeNCe simulator as an open source tool alongside the existing sequential version.

Damage localisation using various signal filtering approaches	PROCEEDINGS OF ISMA2010 - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING INCLUDING USD2010					International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA)/Conference of USD	SEP 20-22, 2010	Leuven, BELGIUM	Dept Mech Engn, Katholieke Univ Leuven				In this paper algorithm for discontinuities localisation in thin panels made of aluminium alloy is proposed. Above mentioned algorithm uses Lamb wave propagation methods for damage localisation. The method is based on the fact that any discontinuities existing in structural elements cause a local changes in material properties and in effect disturb elastic wave propagation. In metallic structures elastic waves can propagate in long distances without significant amplitude attenuation. Therefore large area of structure can be monitored using this method. During experiments elastic waves were generated and received using piezoelectric transducers that were arranged in linear array. Excited elastic waves propagate and reflect from panel boundaries and discontinuities existing in the specimen. Wave reflections are registered through the transducers and used in signal processing algorithm. Proposed processing algorithm contains two parts: signal filtering and extraction of discontinuities location. The first part was used in order to enhance signals by removing noise from them. This is very important part of whole algorithm therefore special attention was focused on the problem of signal filtering. Filtering method were proposed such as: wavelet transform, Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), band pass filters. Wavelet transform was used in order to conduct discrete wavelet analysis and continuous wavelet analysis. First approach allows the multi level wavelet decomposition of the signal and can be used to remove signal component including noise. Continuous wavelet analysis allows to produce a plot of wavelet coefficients. From this plot signal with narrow frequency band can be simply extracted. An approach using STFT allows to create 3D plot of signal in time-frequency domain called spectrogram. From the spectrogram signal with narrow frequency band can be extracted like in the case of the continuous wavelet analysis. Band pass filters use frequency characteristics that pass components from a narrow frequency band. Also custom designed filters can be used for this purpose. Proposed filters were compared and optimal filter was chosen for filtering the signal for damage localisation. Criterion for choosing the optimal filter was based on the results of damage localisation. Second part of signal processing algorithm allows to extract features connected with wave reflections from discontinuities. Based on extracted features damage maps were created. Two damage localisation algorithms have been tested based on: phased array and damage influence maps. Described filtering methods and algorithms of damage localisation were implemented in the MATLAB (R) environment. It should be underlined that in this paper results based only on experimental signals are presented. The measurement set-up contains portable PC, specially designed electronic equipment for elastic waves actuation and sensing and multilayer piezoelectric transducers manufactured by NOLIAC and CERAMTEC.

Wire-Grid and Sparse MoM Antennas: Past Evolution, Present Implementation, and Future Possibilities	SYMMETRY-BASEL												Since the end of the 19th century, radioelectronic devices (REDs) have actively penetrated into all modern community spheres. Achievements in the fields of radio engineering and electronics, as well as computing, information, telecommunications, and other technologies, have greatly contributed to this. The main elements of REDs are antennas and microwave devices. For example, linear (wire) antennas are the basis of long-distance communication agency networks of various law enforcement agencies and departments. The manufacturing of REDs requires the regular and rapid appearance of more and more advanced types with minimal costs. At the same time, the design complexity of REDs and the tightening of EMC requirements caused by the growth of upper frequencies of useful and interfering signals, the mounting density, as well as the capabilities of generators of intentional electromagnetic impacts, together with the need to take into account inter-element, inter-unit, and inter-system interference, require more and more accurate designs of REDs. However, this becomes impossible without computer modeling, which saves the time and financial resources required for their development, as well as to evaluate the correctness of the proposed technical solutions. During the design process, as a rule, a multivariate analysis or optimization of the product is performed. In this case, methods of computational electrodynamics (one of which is the method of moments) are used. They are based on the replacement of continuous functions with their discrete analogues (construction of a grid), which reduces the problem to the solution of a system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE). The problem's complexity depends on the complexity of the SLAE solution, which is determined by its order (which in turn is determined by the complexity of the simulated object and its surrounding area) and by the number of the required SLAE solutions for each problem (determined by the upper frequency of the signal, the number, and range of the optimized parameters). This dramatically increases the computational cost, which becomes the main constraint for the optimal design. Therefore, reducing the computational cost for the analysis and optimization of RED elements (in particular, linear antennas) is an important scientific problem. Meanwhile, finding new antenna structures that meet all the desired features (low price, required characteristics, manufacturable design with small dimensions and windage, etc.) is no less important today. One of the promise solutions for these problems is using a wire grid and sparse antennas for modeling and constructing antennas. Since the last century, a lot of research has been performed on them. The aim of this paper is to review their history and the main related aspects such as computational, acceleration, and optimization used methods, the fields of their application, and their evolution to this moment. In addition, this paper provides a possible future implementation of wire-grid and sparse antennas from the authors' point of view by presenting a new method that is under research to obtain effective wire sparse antennas.

J	Liang, XQ; Kang, LX; Liu, YZ				Liang, Xiaoqiang; Kang, Lixia; Liu, Yongzhong			The Flexible Design for Optimization and Debottlenecking of Multiperiod Hydrogen Networks	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												The operational conditions of hydrogen networks in practical refineries commonly fluctuate due to variation of feed properties, loss of catalyst activity, change of market demand, seasonal shift, and improvement of processing technology as well. These fluctuations could affect the operations of the hydrogen networks, which are usually optimized on the basis of fixed operational conditions in practice. In this work, a flexible design method of a multiperiod hydrogen network is proposed. It features the flexible design of multiperiod hydrogen network by considering discrete operational scenarios in multiple periods and possible fluctuation of each operational scenario. The optimal design of the multiperiod hydrogen network with simple structure and low total annual costs can be obtained by the proposed method. Moreover, the bottlenecks restricting the flexibility of each subperiod can also be identified and eliminated. In addition, the proposed method can be readily implemented. A multiperiod hydrogen system in a refinery is used to exemplify the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can be used to effectively obtain the hydrogen network structure that satisfies the multiperiod operational conditions and reach the flexibility requirements for each subperiod with the lowest total annual costs.					liu, mengjie/KDN-1890-2024; WANG, JIAXUAN/JMP-8599-2023; Liu, Jiahe/JPL-6372-2023														0888-5885					MAR 9	2016	55	9					2574	2583		10.1021/acs.iecr.5b04120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.5b04120													WOS:000371945300007

This paper focuses on one type of network design problem as to whether existing roads should be retrofit into HOT lanes. It is a continuous bi-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. The lower level problem is ridesharing user equilibrium (RUE). To reduce the problem size and facilitate computation, we reformulate RUE in the link-node representation. Then we extend the RUE framework to accommodate the presence of HOT lanes and tolls. Algorithms are briefly discussed and numerical examples are illustrated on the Braess network and the Sioux Falls network, respectively. Results show that carefully selecting the deployment of HOT lanes can improve the overall system travel time. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We call this planning problem "Scheduled Virtual Topology Design". Two problem variants are considered: for a network based on non-reconfigurable equipment and for a network based on reconfigurable equipment. Two MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Program) formulations are proposed, one for each alternative. The number of transceivers in the network is the selected cost figure to minimize. Tests are performed to evaluate the benefits of using reconfigurable equipment under different traffic conditions and network sizes. The reduction in the number of transceivers obtained by allowing temporal variations in the virtual topology seems low in all cases, indicating that using reconfigurable equipment may not be cost-effective for periodic traffic.

ISS Small-Gain Theorem for Networked Discrete-Time Switching Systems	IFAC PAPERSONLINE					21st IFAC World Congress on Automatic Control - Meeting Societal Challenges	JUL 11-17, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Int Federat Automat Control, Siemens, Bayer, ABB, MathWorks, Phoenix Contact, Ifak Technol, Berlin Heart, Elsevier, De Gruyter, Tele Medi GmbH				In this paper it is proved that a networked discrete-time switching system, equipped with a given switches digraph, is input-to-state stable, provided that there exist multiple Lyapunov functions (one for each mode) for each subsystem in the network, satisfying suitable standard inequalities, and provided that a set of suitable vector small-gain conditions are satisfied. The small-gain theorem here provided for the input-to-state stability takes into account the switches digraph. That is, the less is the number of edges in the switches digraph, the less is the number of involved Lyapunov inequalities and small-gain conditions which, if satisfied, guarantee the input-to-state stability of the entire switching system under study. The multiple Lyapunov functions for the entire system, guaranteeing the input-to-state stability, are determined by the multiple Lyapunov functions for each subsystem in the family. To the author's best knowledge, this is the first paper in the literature concerning small-gain theorems for the input-to-state stability of nonlinear discrete-time switching systems with given switches digraphs.

The current LASB collection channel practiced in Taiwan is described and simulated as a discrete event simulation model. In order to enhance the efficiency of the collection process, the effects of system variables on system performance, including return flexibility, collection policy and variability of returned quantity, are examined. A full factorial experiment and a statistical analysis of variance are conducted to examine their effects so that appropriate design of the network can be determined. The results of the simulation study and statistical analysis indicate that various combinations of the system variables result in different system performance. Hence, system designers must select appropriate combinations of various levels among system variables based on their desired objectives.																			1367-5567						2010	13	4					257	271	PII 924429139	10.1080/13675561003724646	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13675561003724646													WOS:000279966800002

This paper introduces a novel Mixed Resolution Network (MixRes) for processing inputs with hybrid spatiotemporal resolutions, namely high-spatial and low-temporal resolution input, as well as low-spatial and high-temporal resolution input. The utilization of mixed spatiotemporal resolutions not only facilitates the independent emphasis of the two streams on appearance and motion encoding but also diminishes the computational burden. Furthermore, by leveraging the characteristics of neural networks with multiple layers, the temporal stream in the proposed network is divided into different steps to capture short-term and long-term motion information. Finally, we design a Temporal Multiscale Motion Excitation (TMME) module, which enhances the motion-related channels of the video representation by employing multiscale temporal differences. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple action recognition benchmarks, including Something-Something V1 & V2 and Kinetics-400. The outcomes validate that the proposed method achieves superior action recognition performance with low computational cost as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

The training of these networks can take significant amounts of time, compute and energy. As datasets get larger and models become more complex, the exploration of model architectures becomes prohibitive. In this paper we examine the compute, energy and time costs of training a U-Net based deep neural network for the problem of predicting short term weather forecasts (called precipitation Nowcasting). By leveraging a combination of data distributed and mixed-precision training, we explore the design space for this problem. We also show that larger models with better performance come at a potentially incremental cost if appropriate optimizations are used. We show that it is possible to achieve a significant improvement in training time by leveraging mixed-precision training without sacrificing model performance. Additionally, we find that a 1549% increase in the number of trainable parameters for a network comes at a relatively smaller 63.22% increase in energy usage for a UNet with 4 encoding layers.																			2377-6943		978-1-7281-9219-2				2020										10.1109/hpec43674.2020.9286241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hpec43674.2020.9286241													WOS:000674720500103

Non-fragile state estimation for discrete Markovian jumping neural networks	NEUROCOMPUTING												In this paper, the non-fragile state estimation problem is investigated for a class of discrete-time neural networks subject to Markovian jumping parameters and time delays. In terms of a Markov chain, the mode switching phenomenon at different times is considered in both the parameters and the discrete delays of the neural networks. To account for the possible gain variations occurring in the implementation, the gain of the estimator is assumed to be perturbed by multiplicative norm-bounded uncertainties. We aim to design a non-fragile state estimator such that, in the presence of all admissible gain variations, the estimation error converges to zero exponentially. By adopting the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the stochastic analysis theory, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the existence of the desired state estimator that guarantees the stability of the overall estimation error dynamics. The explicit expression of such estimators is parameterized by solving a convex optimization problem via the semi-definite programming method. A numerical simulation example is provided to verify the usefulness of the proposed methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Different from the existing literature, the consecutive packet dropouts occurring in communication networks are subject to clock offsets, and the clock offsets between the sensor and the controller are described by a random variable with a certain probability distribution. First, we construct a closed-loop discrete-time stochastic system by considering the random clock offsets and the consecutive packet dropouts in a unified framework. To render the discrete-time system suitable for analysis, an equivalent yet tractable stochastic augmented model is then established, where the system matrix is characterized by high nonlinearity and dual randomness, which poses substantial difficulties for the expectation operation in the controller design process. In order to deal with the difficulties, the law of total expectation, confluent Vandermonde matrix, and Kronecker product operation are introduced and then a stability condition in the form of linear matrix inequality is obtained. Based on this, a desired controller is designed, such that the closed-loop stochastic system is stochastically stable. Finally, a numerical example with two cases and an example using batch reactor are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.

For long, network design strategies have been driven by mere deployment CAPital EXpenditures (CAPEX). Today however, the feedback and the experience gathered from the management of former networks strongly push for the consideration of other sources of cost for the design of networks. This paper focuses on the optimization of FTTH networks deployment under Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) considerations. Mixed integer formulations are first argued for the modelling of these decision problems. Then, numerical tests performed on real-life data prove the efficiency of branch and bound approaches for such models.

The topology of the physical layer is assumed given with the predefined paths for each node-pair. The output is the size of required ATM switches, and the configuration of both, ATM and optical switches. The obtained result is optimal in sense of reduced resource usage on ATR? level, i.e., reduced electrical processing, subject to capacity and connectivity constraints. The results are derived for WDM networks and generalized for networks with optical cables where multiple fibers per cable are used (Space Division Multiplexing). The idea of layered design is also introduced.

Unlike most existing studies that only considered a single type of traffic, our work addresses the scheduling problem of mixed-criticality traffic in TSN. Time utility function (TUF) is a utility curve that measures the quality of service (QoS) of streams with respect to end-to-end delays. In this paper, we introduce a variety of TUFs for different streams in TSN according to specific timing requirements. To match the transmission protocol of TSN, we first categorize mixed-criticality traffic into periodic and aperiodic streams, and then design a novel scheduling scheme aiming to maximize the total TUF value of all streams. We compare our proposed scheme with two benchmark schemes, and evaluation results show that our proposed one outperforms the counterparts, especially under the worst-case network settings.

However, most researchers in this area have merely focused on how to make full use of CNNs to solve various problems in areas such as pattern recognition, classification, associate memory and cryptography. The philosophy of how to design a CNN is seldom discussed. In this paper, we present a general methodology for designing CNNs. By appropriately choosing a self-feedback mechanism, and also including coupling functions and an external stimulus, we have succeeded in proving that a dynamical system, defined by discrete time feedback equations, does, indeed, possess interesting chaotic properties. To the best of our knowledge, the results presented here are novel and pioneering.

Specifically, the strongly observable condition and observer matching condition are provided for the convenience of analysis. Two kinds of fixed-time observers for sensor networks are developed based on the system's observability and the properties of nilpotent matrices. The convergence time of the first kind of observer depends on the target state's dimension and the rank of the noise input matrix. Besides, to further reduce the convergence time, another kind of observer is designed with the thought of the reduced-order observer. Its convergence time is related to the dimension of the target state and the rank of the augmented measurement matrix. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time observers is demonstrated by simulation examples.					liu, qi/KFA-4047-2024; Zhao, ZiHao/KHT-4413-2024	LIU, Zhongxin/0000-0002-3565-4800													1570-8705	1570-8713				NOV 1	2023	150								103278	10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103278		AUG 2023											WOS:001060030900001

The network topology is directed, and only partial followers can exchange information with the leader. In the light of the continuous consensus law for the nominal network control systems, a discontinuous integral sliding mode protocol is designed to ensure that networked control systems with bounded disturbances achieve the consensus in a setting time. Furthermore, this article also solve the problem that the sliding function chattering and the control gains are difficult to determine in discontinuous consistency protocol. The continuous integral sliding mode consensus protocol is proposed. It is pointed out that the advantage of adaptive control method is that it can automatically adjust the controller gain, and may ensure the control protocol execute well without prior knowledge of networked control systems.

A vertex is recovered when it becomes connected to the depot by an already constructed path. Due dates for recovery times are associated with vertices. The problem is to obtain a construction schedule that minimizes the maximum lateness of vertices, or the number of tardy vertices.

Considering the effect of the network, the closed-loop system is modelled as a time-varying delay system and stability criteria is established based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii method. The co-design of the controller gain and DETS parameters is achieved. An optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal DETS triggering thresholds.

The architecture is realized adopting a delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) approach allowing end users to adopt standard devices. A buffer aware contact graph routing algorithm is designed to account for the buffer occupancy of the nSATs and for the connection planning derived from their visibility periods. At the terrestrial uplink, a coded random access is employed to realize a high-capacity interface for the typically irregular traffic of 5G users, while, at the space uplink, the DTN architecture is combined with the contention resolution diversity slotted Aloha protocol to match the recent update of the DVB-RCS2 standard. To achieve a reliable testing of the introduced functionalities, an accurate analysis of the statistic of the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio and of the capture probability at each mmWave link is developed by including interference, shadowing, fading, and noise. The application of the designed architecture to data transfer services in conjunction with possible delay reduction strategies, and an extension to inter-satellite communication, are finally presented by estimating the resulting loss/delay performance through a discrete-time discrete-event platform based on the integration of Matlab with Network Simulator 3.

However, its evaluation process is a highly complex system decision-making, for there are various factors that influence on the assessment of for the College Teachers' the teaching ability. The traditional methods have drawbacks of strong subjectivity, so they are difficult to correctly evaluate the teaching ability of College Teachers, resulting in decrease of measurement accuracy. Based on the analysis of the relevant factors, this paper presents an intelligent design based neural network model of discrete Hopfield for the measurement and analysis of College Teachers' teaching ability. Firstly, a Hopfield neural network model for the measure analysis of the teaching ability is established, and eleven measure analysis indexes are selected as input information of the Hopfield neural network model. Secondly, the College Teachers' teaching ability grades are chosen as the model output, then the input and output model based on the relationship among the self-learning abilities of neural network is established. Finally, the simulation experiment is obtained by using MATLAB. The simulation results show that the model has the characteristics of high efficiency, objectivity and fairness, which can meet the requirements of the measurement and analysis of College Teachers' teaching ability.

J	Niu, JJ; Fu, YL; Qi, XY				Niu Jianjun; Fu Yongling; Qi Xiaoye			Design and Application of Discrete Sliding Mode Control with RBF Network-based Switching Law	CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS												This article proposes a novel approach combining exponential-reaching-law-based equivalent control law with radial basis function (RBF) network-based switching law to strengthen the sliding mode control (SMC) tracking capacity for systems with uncertainties and disturbances. First, SMC discrete equivalent control law is designed on the basis of the nominal model of the system and the adaptive exponential reaching law, and subsequently, stability of the algorithm is analyzed. Second, RBF network is used to form the switching law in a direct and online manner with sliding-mode-related inputs and by approximating evaluation function; and the method to adjust its parameters is devised. Finally, comparable experiments are carried out to verify the application of the proposed approach to an inner-axis driven by a direct current (DC) torque motor through extra-low speed servo for a high precision flight simulator, and the axis works under deteriorating conditions such as periodically fluctuating torques of motor, nonlinear friction, and time-varying model parameters. The results show that the combined SMC can effectively improve the servo performance, for instance, to a stable 0.000 08 (degrees)/s speed response, the tracking error would be within 0.000 08 degrees in 98% of operating times. Moreover, the hybrid nature of the approach imparts the RBF network the features of removing offline training and case to set initial parameters.																			1000-9361					JUN	2009	22	3					279	284		10.1016/S1000-9361(08)60100-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1000-9361(08)60100-4													WOS:000267970800011

This new DETM is devised to adjust the date packet transmissions flexibly with hope to save network resources. By constructing a new Lyapunov function dependent on the information of the singular perturbation parameter (SPP) and DETM, a sufficient condition is derived which ensures that the error dynamics of state estimation is finite-time stable. The parameters of the state estimator are given by means of the solutions to several matrix inequalities and the upper bound of the SPP can be evaluated simultaneously. The effectiveness of the designed state estimator is demonstrated by a numerical example.																			2161-2927		978-988-15638-0-4				2021							4907	4912																WOS:000931046705006

Combining Lyapunov stability theory and several integral inequalities, fixed -time synchronization criteria of master and slave systems are established. Through sensitivity analysis, we find the key controller parameters that have a great influence on the maximum settling time. Using the chaotic sequences generated by the neural network, the color image can be encrypted by the Arnold Cat Map and pixel diffusion.

This letter shows that the simplest logic to fit the XOR problem involves boundaries that cannot be mapped by a multi-layer perceptron with just two hidden nodes. This observation calls into question rule extraction methodologies based on pruning, since this practice can lock the network into a subspace of achievable continuous valued logic functions that prevent it from mapping the simplest logic to explain the data.

J	Kandali, K; Bennis, L; Bennis, H				Kandali, Khalid; Bennis, Lamyae; Bennis, Hamid			A New Hybrid Routing Protocol Using a Modified K-Means Clustering Algorithm and Continuous Hopfield Network for VANET	IEEE ACCESS												Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) offer several user applications for passengers and drivers, as well as security and internet access applications. To ensure efficient data transmission between vehicles, a reliable routing protocol is considered a significant challenge. This paper suggests a new clustering-based routing protocol combining a modified K-Means algorithm with Continuous Hopfield Network and Maximum Stable Set Problem (KMRP) for VANET. In this way, the basic input parameters of the K-Means algorithm, such as the number of clusters and the initial cluster heads, will not be selected randomly, but using Maximum Stable Set Problem and Continuous Hopfield Network. Then the assignment of vehicles to clusters will be carried out according to Link Reliability Model as a metric that replaces the distance parameter in the K-Means algorithm. Finally, the cluster head is selected by weight function according to the amount of free buffer space, the speed, and the node degree. The simulation results have proved that the designed protocol performs better in a highway vehicular environment, compared to the most recent schemes designed for the same objective. In fact, KMRP reduces traffic congestion, and thus provides a significant increase in Throughput. In addition, KMRP decreases the transmission delay and guarantees the stability of the clusters in high density and mobility, which acts better in terms of the Packet Delivery Ratio.

We analyze the hub network configuration under cost minimization and profit maximization behaviors. We extend a perfect inelasticity on demand with cost minimization to an elastic demand hub location design with profit maximization. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer program that is solved using implicit enumeration with an embedded pricing subproblem.

Continuous aggregation is usually required in many sensor applications to obtain the temporal variation information of some interesting aggregates. However, for the continuous in-network aggregation in a hostile environment, the adversary could manipulate a series of aggregation results through compromised nodes to fabricate false temporal variation patterns of the aggregates. Existing secure aggregation schemes conduct one individual verification for each aggregation result. Due to the high rate and the long period of a continuous aggregation, directly applying these schemes to detect false temporal variation pattern would incur a great communication cost. In this paper, we identify distinct design issues for protecting continuous in-network aggregation and propose a novel scheme to detect false temporal variation patterns. Compared with the existing schemes, our scheme greatly reduces the communication cost by selecting and checking only a small part of aggregation results to verify the correctness of the temporal variation patterns in a time window. The checking of the aggregation results uses a sampling-based approach, which enables our scheme independent of any particular in-network aggregation protocol. We also propose a series of security mechanisms to protect the sampling process. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.

NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS												This paper studies the event-triggered control problem for networked switched systems with actuator saturation. An event-triggering strategy is developed based on discrete event-triggered samplings. By which, a waiting time is first ensured to avoid the Zeno-like behavior, and then the data transmission is carried out once a desired performance-dependent condition is satisfied. According to the implementation of the triggering strategy and considering the impacts of transmission delay and actuator satu- ration, a time-delay closed-loop switched system is developed. Subsequently, sufficient conditions to ensure stability of the closed-loop system are derived by making use of the average dwell time and multiple Lyapunov functions method. In particular, since the waiting time, periodic sampling instants, data updating instants and switching instants may be coupled with each other, typical cases are discussed thoroughly to analyze the system stability. Moreover, together with the estimation of domain of attraction, sufficient conditions for the design of the desired state-feedback sub-controller gains and event-triggering parameters are presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations.

For the low frequency coefficients, we apply the maximum selection rule (MSR). For the high frequency coefficients, spatial frequency (SF) of each high frequency subband is considered as the gradient features of images to motivate dual-channel PCNN networks and generate pulse of neurons.

A common approach to this task is to harness recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, while their predictions are quite accurate, their learning process is complex and, thus, time and energy consuming. Here, we propose to extend the concept of RRNs by including continuous-variable quantum resources in it and to use a quantum-enhanced RNN to overcome these obstacles. The design of the continuous-variable quantum RNN (CV-QRNN) is rooted in the continuous-variable quantum computing paradigm. By performing extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the quantum network is capable of learning-time dependence of several types of temporal data and that it converges to the optimal weights in fewer epochs than a classical network. Furthermore, for a small number of trainable parameters, it can achieve lower losses than its classical counterpart. CV-QRNN can be implemented using commercially available quantum-photonic hardware.

This paper studies the possible consequences of basing the design of urban transit networks on the preferences of specific traveler groups. To that end it develops an analytical network optimization model that considers a mix of different traveler groups simultaneously. Results from the analyses show that focusing on specific traveler groups leads to clearly different network design characteristics. However, the optimal network design developed for the average traveler proves to be the best network for all traveler groups. Furthermore it was found that focusing on traveler groups having good transport alternatives leads to very low values of consumer surplus and social. welfare. Optimizing transit networks by considering different traveler groups simultaneously, results in similar networks as in the traditional single user-class approach based on the average traveler. The differences in preferences for the traveler groups appears to be balanced by the size of the resulting transit patronage. Apparently, a more realistic description of the PT demand side is not essential for urban transit network design.						van Nes, Rob/0000-0003-1022-9661															978-962-8804-18-4				2002							219	228																WOS:000261327900022

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDOs)-belonging in the heme dioxygenase family-degrade l-tryptophan to kynurenines. These enzymes are also responsible for the de novo synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). As such, they are expressed by a variety of species, including fungi. Interestingly, Aspergillus may degrade l-tryptophan not only via IDO but also via alternative pathways. Deciphering the molecular interactions regulating tryptophan metabolism is particularly critical for novel drug target discovery designed to control pathogen determinants in invasive infections. Using continuous time Bayesian networks over a time-course gene expression dataset, we inferred the global regulatory network controlling l-tryptophan metabolism. The method unravels a possible novel approach to target fungal virulence factors during infection. Furthermore, this study represents the first application of continuous-time Bayesian networks as a gene network reconstruction method in Aspergillus metabolism.

The symbol error rate gap between the perfect and predicted channel state information is small.																			1089-7798	1558-2558				MAR	2017	21	3					672	675		10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2632120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2632120													WOS:000398251500057

In addition to the need to consider cost issues, the consumers' preferences will also have a significant impact on the resulting network. We propose an integrated transportation and location optimization model for designing logistic networks. Our model uses a hybrid iterative heuristic based on a genetic algorithm and a constrained multinomial logit, which includes consumers' preferences and quality of service variables. Our results show relevant differences when considering, along with network costs, parameters related to the consumers: travel distance, congestion, waiting time, and service time.

In this context, two main aspects are vital for network operators. On one hand, there is the need for proper mechanisms to rapidly and easily (re-)configure the network, to adapt to its changing conditions over time. On the other hand, applications for continuous network monitoring become essential to detect security problems or performance degradation. This is fundamental to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for every running service. This paper aims at proposing a new framework for the implementation of fast and scalable applications for real-time continuous network monitoring and data analysis. High-level abstractions will be provided to the network programmer, and the Data Stream Processing computational model will be exploited to improve performance. The framework architecture is described, along with the implementation design for this kind of applications. The main challenges are presented, with proposed solutions to tackle them. Finally, the current status of the work is discussed, along with its future developments.

A study is conducted of the possible consequences of basing the design of urban transit networks on the preferences of specific traveler groups. To that end, an analytical network optimization model is developed that considers a mix of different traveler groups simultaneously. Results from the analyses show that focusing on specific traveler groups leads to clearly different network design characteristics. However, the optimal network design developed for the average traveler proved to be the best network for all traveler groups. Furthermore, it was found that focusing on traveler groups having good transport alternatives led to very low values of consumer surplus and social welfare. Optimizing transit networks while considering different traveler groups simultaneously results in networks that are similar to those using the traditional single-user-class approach based on the average traveler. Differences in preferences for traveler groups are balanced by the size of the resulting transit patronage. Apparently, a more realistic description of the demand side is not essential for urban transit network design.						van Nes, Rob/0000-0003-1022-9661													0361-1981		0-309-08569-1				2003		1835					25	33																WOS:000188095300004

Their analysis may require the experimental study through simulation. A simulation environment for large network infrastructures must be carefully designed since the simulator performance becomes a critical issue as the model complexity increases. Our effort to design such a simulation environment was driven by the need to evaluate heuristic routing strategies for very large communication networks through experimental studies. We have chosen to employ the object oriented paradigm in our approach. In addition, critical issues such as the choice of pre-scheduling versus post-scheduling and the generation of a priori service time had to be considered during the design. In this paper we give an overview of the design of an object oriented simulation tool for large networks and discuss some of the issues that are pertinent to the design of a discrete event simulator for the study of complex communication infrastructures.

Our focus is on a class of discrete-time linear consensus networks whose dynamics evolve in time by switching between symmetric doubly-stochastic matrices that are drawn from a given finite set of realizations, which are dictated by a discrete random variable with a known probability mass function (pmf). The mean square deviation of the output from zero is utilized as a performance measure to quantify the noise propagation across the network. The direct computation of the performance measure, however, suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The first objective of this paper is to report a rather tight lower-bound for the performance measure that requires comparably less computations. Our second goal is to design a randomly switching network by minimizing the overall performance measure with respect to the vector of switching probabilities between consecutive realizations. Indeed, we prove that the performance measure is a convex function of the vector of switching probabilities, and furthermore, the optimal network design problem can be cast as a Semi-Definite Program (SDP). Moreover, we show that the performance measure is a convex function of the link weights of all underlying graphs, which implies that one can perform a reweighting procedure to minimize the performance measure using convenient convex programming tools. Different aspects of our theoretical results are illustrated via numerous examples and simulations.

Considering the random property of the networked-induced delay, the original system is transformed into a new delay model with stochastic parameter matrices by introducing a novel state augmentation technique. Based on the new model, a new delay-distribution-dependent criterion for the mean square stability of the closed-loop system is derived by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and linear matrix inequality technique. The solvability of the derived criterion depends on not only the size of the delay, but also the probability distribution of the delay taking value in a finite set.

J	Durbin, M; Hoffman, K				Durbin, Martin; Hoffman, Karla			The dance of the thirty-ton trucks: Dispatching and scheduling in a dynamic environment	OPERATIONS RESEARCH												We report on the application of operations research to a very complex scheduling and dispatching problem. Scheduling and dispatching are never easy, but the scheduling of concrete deliveries is particularly difficult for several reasons: ( 1) concrete is an extremely perishable product - it can solidify in the truck if offloading is delayed by a few hours; ( 2) customer orders are extremely unpredictable and volatile - orders are often canceled or drastically changed at the last minute; ( 3) the concrete company overbooks by as much as 20% to compensate for customer unpredictability; ( 4) many orders require synchronized deliveries by multiple trucks; ( 5) when a truck arrives at a customer site, the customer may not be ready for the delivery, or a storm may negate the ability to use the concrete; and ( 6) most of the travel takes place in highly congested urban areas, making travel times highly variable. To assist the dispatchers, schedulers, and order takers at this company, we designed and implemented a decision-support tool consisting of both planning and execution tools. The modules determine whether new orders should be accepted, when drivers should arrive for work, the real-time assignment of drivers to delivery loads, the dispatching of these drivers to customers and back to plants, and the scheduling of the truck loadings at the plants. For the real-time dispatching and order-taking decisions, optimization models are solved to within 1% of optimality every five minutes throughout the day. This nearly continuous reoptimization of the entire system allows quick reactions to changes. The modeling foundation is a time-space network with integer side constraints. We describe each of the models and explain how we handle imperfect data. We also detail how we overcome a variety of implementation issues. The success of this project can be measured, most importantly, by the fact that the tool is being ported by the parent company, Florida Rock, to each of its other ready-mix concrete companies. Second, the corporation is sufficiently convinced of its importance that they have begun promoting this methodology as a "best practice" at the World of Concrete and ConAgg industry conventions.																			0030-364X					JAN-FEB	2008	56	1					3	19		10.1287/opre.1070.0459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.1070.0459													WOS:000254140700002

The reduction of water usage decreases the capital cost for process industry. This paper presents a design model of water/wastewater network with multiple contaminants. The main purpose is minimizing the total fixed cost (TFC) and the total annual cost (TAC) of overall water network including annual cost of water usage and water treatment compared between two design models. The first model is retrofit design of water network model by a liner programming (LP) for design with treatment. The second model is simultaneous grassroots design of water/wastewater network with minimum TAC by a mixed-integer non-liner programming (MINLP). According to the main purpose, a non-linear programming (NLP) model is solved for good initial variables for the MINLP in the second model. This model uses data from published work.

However, implementing onchip learning algorithms on such architectures is still an open challenge, especially for multi-layer networks that rely on the back-propagation algorithm. In this paper, we present a spike-based learning method that approximates back-propagation using local weight update mechanisms and which is compatible with mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic circuits. We introduce a network architecture that enables synaptic weight update mechanisms to back-propagate error signals across layers and present a network that can be trained to distinguish between two spike-based patterns that have identical mean firing rates, but different spike-timings. This work represents a first step towards the design of ultra-low power mixed-signal neuromorphic processing systems with on-chip learning circuits that can be trained to recognize different spatio-temporal patterns of spiking activity (e.g. produced by event-based vision or auditory sensors).

West Churchman's seminal work The Design of Inquiring Systems, the study herein develops a systems design theory for continuous auditing systems. The discussion focuses on the two foundational theories, development of the theory of Complex Adaptive Inquiring Organizations (CAIO) and associated design principles for a continuous auditing system supporting a CAIO, and instantiation of the CAIO theory. The instantiation consists of an agent-based model depicting the marketplace for Frontier Airlines that generates an anticipated market share used as an integral component in a mock auditor going concern opinion for the airline. As a whole, the study addresses the lack of an underlying system design theory and comprehensive view needed to build upon and advance the continuous assurance movement and addresses the question of how continuous auditing systems should be designed to produce knowledge - knowledge that benefits auditors, clients, and society as a whole.																			0269-8889	1469-8005				MAY	2015	30	3			SI		265	296		10.1017/S0269888913000428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0269888913000428													WOS:000353503800002

Consequently, it is very important to design access networks to facilitate efficient local data exchange. In the past few years, most existing studies focus on either the wired or wireless domains. In this paper, we aim to exploit both the wired and wireless domains. Specifically, we consider a Fiber-Wireless access network in which a passive optical network (PON) connects densely deployed base stations. In such a scenario, we propose a novel access scheme, namely, NCDA, where the main idea is to utilize both network coding and device association. To understand the potentials of NCDA, we first formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to minimize the weighted number of packet transmissions (WNT), which is related to both the system capacity and energy consumption. We then theoretically analyze the tight upper bounds of the minimal WNT in the PON, which helps us to approximate the original problem by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Next, we develop efficient algorithms based on linear programming relaxation to solve the optimal NCDA problem. To validate our design, we conduct extensive simulation experiments, which demonstrate the impact of important network parameters and the promising potentials of the proposed scheme.

For this purpose, 81 different concrete mixes were prepared in the laboratory of a ready-mixed concrete plant. Sixty-nine randomly selected mixes (85% of the prepared mixes) were used to train two developed ANN. The first ANN produces optimal proportions of a concrete mix based on specified properties. The second ANN predicts the properties of a concrete mix based on its proportions. The remaining 12 mixes were used to validate the developed ANN and to compare their outcome with those obtained using three existing proportioning methods. It was found that both developed ANN produce results with root-mean-squared error lower than those obtained using the other studied methods. It is therefore recommended that concrete producers develop similar ANN for the set of their local materials and for the properties that they deem important for them. The expected better accuracy of the proposed procedure justifies its implementation and the money spent in the original testing programme used for the network training.

In order to design effective consensus protocols, which were aimed at ensuring that the concerned states of agents converged to a common value, a new consensus protocol for general discrete-time multi-agent system was proposed based on Lyapunov stability theory. For discrete-time multi-agent systems with desired trajectory, trajectory tracking and formation control problems were studied. The main idea of trajectory tracking problems was to design trajectory controller such that each agent tracked desired trajectory. For a type of formation problem with fixed formation structure, the formation structure set was introduced. According to the formation structure set, each agent can track its individual desired trajectory. Finally, simulations were provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. The numerical results show that the states of agents converge to zero with consensus protocol, which is said to achieve a consensus asymptotically. In addition, through designing appropriate trajectory controllers, the simulation results show that agents converge to the desired trajectory asymptotically and can form different formations.																			1005-9784	1993-0666				AUG	2011	18	4					1161	1168		10.1007/s11771-011-0818-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11771-011-0818-z													WOS:000292560900033

J	Khan, MI				Khan, Mohammad Iqbal			Mix proportions for HPC incorporating multi-cementitious composites using artificial neural networks	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS												High performance concrete (HPC) is defined in terms of both strength and durability performance under anticipated environmental conditions. HPC can be manufactured involving up to 10 different ingredients whilst having to consider durability properties in addition to strength. The number of ingredients and the number of properties of HPC, which needs to be considered in its design, are more than those for ordinary concrete. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the mix proportions and other properties of this type of concrete using statistical empirical relationship. An alternative approach is to use an artificial neural network (ANN). Based on the experimentally obtained results. ANN has been used to establish its applicability to the prediction and optimization of mix proportioning for HPC. It was demonstrated that mix proportioning for HPC can be predicted using ANN. However, some trial mixes are necessary for better performance and elimination of material variability factors from place to place. ANN procedure provides guidelines to select appropriate material proportions for required strength and rheology of concrete mixes and will reduce the number of trial mixes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Savaresi, SM; Guardabassi, GO				Savaresi, SM; Guardabassi, GO			Approximate I/O feedback linearization of discrete-time non-linear systems via virtual input direct design	AUTOMATICA												The design of linearizing compensators via output-feedback for discrete-time non-linear plants, using I/O measurements only, is typically performed in an indirect way by identifying first a non-linear model of the plant, and resorting then to a suitable model-based design technique. In this paper we propose the use of a new method, based on a virtual input direct design (VID2) approach. The main feature of such a method is to carry the control design into a standard non-linear mapping approximation problem, thus avoiding any preliminary plant-identification phase. As compared with the existing methods, the new one requires less computational effort, while taking full advantage of the non-linear approximation software tools already available. In this paper, the new method is described, and some theoretical results are given, concerning the I/O linearization of discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback.

A Switching Approach to Designing Finite-Time Synchronization Controllers of Coupled Neural Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												This paper is concerned with the finite-time synchronization issue of nonlinear coupled neural networks by designing a new switching pinning controller. For the fixed network topology and control strength, the newly designed controller could optimize the synchronization time by regulating a parameter a (0 <= alpha < 1). The control law presented in this paper covers both continuous controllers and discontinuous ones, which were studied separately in the past. Some criteria are discussed in detail on how to shorten the synchronization time for the strongly connected networks.

The virtual topology design problem is a mixed integer linear formulation. Heuristic algorithms for this problem where suggested to relax MILP problem such as Heuristic Topology Design Algorithm (HLDA), the minimum-delay logical topology algorithm (MLDA) heuristic, Random logical design algorithm (RLDA) and traffic independent logical design algorithm (TILDA). In this paper, we compare the performance of several heuristic topology design algorithms using large networks such as 14 NSFNET. The results shows that MLDA and TILDA tend to design logical topologies using a smaller number of wavelengths than HLDA while RLDA gave a vibrating results in which we cannot depend on to get an accurate performance.

Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram Based Discrete Transportation Network Design	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION												The presence of demand uncertainty brings challenges to network design problems (NDP), because fluctuations in origin-destination (OD) demand have a prominent effect on the corresponding total travel time, which is usually adopted as an index to evaluate the network design problem. Fortunately, the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) has been proved to be a property of the road network itself, independent of the origin-destination demand. Such characteristics of an MFD provide a new theoretical basis to assess the traffic network performance and further appraise the quality of network design strategies. Focusing on improving network capacity under the NDP framework, this paper formulates a bi-level programming model, where at the lower level, flows are assigned to the newly extended network subject to user equilibrium theory, and the upper level determines which links should be added to achieve the maximum network capacity. To solve the proposed model, we design an algorithm framework, where traffic flow distribution of each building strategy is calculated under the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE), and updated through the VISSIM-COM-Python interaction. Then, the output data are obtained to shape MFDs, and k-means clustering algorithm is employed to quantify the MFD-based network capacity. Finally, the methodology is implemented in a test network, and the results show the benefits of using the MFD-based method to solve the network design problem under stochastic OD demands. Specifically, the capacity paradox is also presented in the test results.

First, a new local description of the bounded H8 synchronisation performance index is proposed, which considers only the synchronisation errors among neighbours. In addition, a more general sector-bounded condition is presented, where the parameter matrices are different for different node. Next, by establishing the vector dissipativity-like for the complex network dynamics, the H8 synchronisation criterion is derived in term of the locally coupled conditions for each node. These conditions implemented in a cooperative manner can judge whether the complex network reaches synchronisation. Similarly, the existence conditions for the estimator on each node are obtained, and then the estimator parameters are designed via the recursive linear matrix inequalities. Notably, these conditions on each node by cooperation among neighbours can achieve the desirable performance index. The distinctive features of the authors' algorithms are low complexity, scalability, and distributed execution. At last, two numerical examples are utilised to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithms.

In this work, we cast NN quantization as a discrete labelling problem, and by examining relaxations, we design an efficient iterative optimization procedure that involves stochastic gradient descent followed by a projection. We prove that our simple projected gradient descent approach is, in fact, equivalent to a proximal version of the well-known mean-field method. These findings would allow the decades-old and theoretically grounded research on MRF optimization to be used to design better network quantization schemes. Our experiments on standard classification datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10/100, TinyImageNet) with convolutional and residual architectures show that our algorithm obtains fully-quantized networks with accuracies very close to the floating-point reference networks.																			1550-5499		978-1-7281-4803-8				2019							4870	4879		10.1109/ICCV.2019.00497	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2019.00497													WOS:000531438105003

Model-Based Networked Control Systems use an explicit model of the plant in order to reduce the network traffic while attempting to prevent excessive performance degradation. Intermittent Feedback consists of the loop remaining closed for some time interval, then open for another interval. We begin by investigating the behavior of the system while tracking a reference input. We provide the full response of the system and a condition for stability.

Enabling the use of high-spectral-efficiency modulation formats (HSE-MFs) such as DQPSK or PM-QPSK for 40 or 100 Gbps respectively is one of the suggested on-going researches. However, some lightpaths may not require the highest rate and this call for mixed-line rate (MLR) networks. In MLR networks xQPSK formats' reachability decreases due to cross-phase-modulation (XPM) induced by neighbouring OOK channels. Therefore, to increase MLR networks spectral efficiency it should be able to use HSE-MF for high capacity demands. However, the choice of the MF to establish a lightpath is dependent on the length to satisfy the Bit-error-rate (BER) constraint. For that, we should route the high capacity demand in the shortest physical routes and vice versa. Thus, in this work we demonstrate the importance of traffic serving ordering based either on demand capacity or physical route in the static phase of the network design. We use the Core-Topology of the Pan-European network with a static traffic matrix of Log-Normal distribution. Serving traffic in the increasing order of the demands' shortest-path shows the best performance in term of blocking and resources utilization.																			2162-7339		978-1-5386-0859-3				2017																								WOS:000427031500410

The main elements in designing a distribution network are location and routing decisions. As these elements are interdependent in many distribution networks, the overall system cost can decrease if location and routing decisions are simultaneously tackled. In this paper, we consider a Capacitated Location-Routing Problem with Mixed Backhauls (CLRPMB) which is a general case of the capacitated location-routing problem. CLRPMB is defined as finding locations of the depots and designing vehicle routes in such a way that pickup and delivery demands of each customer must be performed with the same vehicle and the overall cost is minimized. Since CLRPMB is an NP-hard problem, we propose a memetic algorithm to solve the problem. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct an experimental study and compare its results with the lower bounds obtained by the branch-and-cut algorithm on a set of instances derived from the literature. Computational results indicate that the proposed approach is able to find optimal or very good quality solutions in a reasonable computation time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We apply Bayesian experimental design to select active measurements that maximize the amount of information we gain about the network path properties subject to given resource constraints. We then apply network inference techniques to reconstruct the properties of interest based on the partial, indirect observations we get through these measurements. By casting network measurement in a general Bayesian decision theoretic framework, we achieve flexibility. Our framework can support a variety of design requirements, including i) differentiated design for providing better resolution to certain parts of the network; ii) augmented design for conducting additional measurements given existing observations; and iii) joint design for supporting multiple users who are interested in different parts of the network. Our framework is also scalable and can design measurement experiments that span thousands of routers and end hosts. We develop a toolkit that realizes the framework on PlanetLab. We conduct extensive evaluation using both real traces and synthetic data. Our results show that the approach can accurately estimate network-wide and individual path properties by only monitoring within 2%-10% of paths. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in providing differentiated monitoring, supporting continuous monitoring, and satisfying the requirements of multiple users.																			1063-6692	1558-2566				FEB	2009	17	1					106	119		10.1109/TNET.2008.925635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2008.925635													WOS:000263604500009

We examine the suitability of four different modelling techniques for predicting deforestation; Bayesian networks (BNs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), Gaussian processes (GPs), and generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). The analysis is provided in the context of the Verified Carbon Standard Approved Methodology for Avoided Unplanned Deforestation to illustrate specific examples of scenarios where each technique would be suitable. ANNs potentially improve predictions over GLMMs, while GPs were better able to generalise to other geographic areas. ANNs were sensitive to design decisions, which may limit their applications where results are required within short time frames. BNs easily facilitate scenario analysis, but are also sensitive to design decisions. With machine learning becoming easier each day, we encourage researchers to consider carefully which technique is suitable for their situation prior to beginning implementation.

In this study, graphical representation of supply networks is studied for process graph modeling of a hypothetical example. The proposed graphical approach is expected to overcome these weaknesses of mixed integer programming.

In military MANETs (e.g., Future Combat Systems (FCS) networks), to multi-level security (MLS) separation makes it impractical to impossible to pass information about the actual path taken by flows between samelevel "red" security enclaves on different nodes in the insecure "black" network. In this paper, we address this challenge and design an e2e QoS mechanism that can provide 'service assurances to flows that need to traverse "opaque" network segments en-route their destination. Our contribution is two-fold.- (a) we provide a design of an e2e QoS assurance mechanism in wireless heterogeneous networking environments wherein the characteristics of intermediate network may not be known to the originating segment and (b) we use discrete event simulation techniques to analyse and illustrate the potentiallstrengths of the proposed QoS solution.																					978-1-4244-0617-3				2006							2750	+																WOS:000244601005011

Two key properties (reasonably high conductivity, with high dielectric loss and magnetic permeability) were targeted here by using multiwall nanotubes (MWCNTs) and BaTiO3/Fe3O4 (BT/Fe) co-doped graphene oxide (GO) sheets to design soft functional nanocomposites using bi-component blends of PC (polycarbonate) and PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride). High dielectric loss and magnetic permeability were achieved by uniformly distributing BT and Fe nanoparticles on the huge specific surface area provided by the GO sheets. The MWCNTs were non-covalently modified to exfoliate the nanotubes and to get a well-connected structure of the blend components. The MWCNTs were thoroughly characterized by TEM, UV-vis, fluorescence emission, Raman and TGA. This surface modification of the MWCNTs also helps with their specific localization in the continuous bi-component blends. BT and Fe were co-doped onto the GO sheets by a well-designed step-by-step synthesis protocol, and the product can facilitate the absorption of incoming EM radiation. This hybrid structure was thoroughly characterized by various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. By following a sequential mixing protocol, the BT/Fe co-doped GO sheets can be specifically localized in the PC components of the blends while the MWCNTs localize in the PVDF phase through a process driven by thermodynamics. This provides excellent heterogeneous boundaries with multiple scattering within the engineered nanostructures, in addition to retaining the conducting network and the associated dielectric loss properties. The resultant local field variation of such boundaries and the presence of highly lossy materials readily enhance the EM attenuation coefficient. The bulk compositions exhibited a high shielding effectiveness (SE) of -35 dB at 18 GHz (>85% absorption), and when rationally stacked into a multilayer architecture with absorption-multiple reflection-absorption pathways, the SE was further enhanced to -46 dB for a thin shield of 0.9 mm thickness. Such a high SE indicates >99.99% attenuation of the incoming EM radiation. This new-generation EM suppressor, distinguished by its multifunctionality and tunable dielectric and magnetic properties, hence offers an amendable, cost-effective replacement to existing solutions.

Fighting erosion in dynamic large-scale overlay networks	21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS					21st International Conference on Advanced Networking and Applications	MAY 21-23, 2007	Niagara Falls, CANADA	IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc, Nokia				Overlay management protocols have been introduced to guarantee overlay network connectivity in dynamic large-scale peer-to-peer systems. Some of these protocols have been specifically designed to avoid the partitioning of the overlay in large clusters (network breakage) despite massive node failures and the continuous arrivals/departures of nodes (churn). In this paper we identify a second effect connected to churn, namely network erosion. We show how erosion affects overlay network connectivity and point out that even a strongly connected overlay network, when exposed to continuous churn, can be disgregated. More specifically the consequences of erosion are shown, through an experimental study, in the context of overlay management protocols based on the view-exchange technique. We finally propose a connection recovery mechanism to be endowed at each node which is able to collaboratively detect node isolation and the presence of small clusters. This mechanism is shown to be effective in reducing the erosion of an overlay network exposed to continuous churn and to quickly recover its connectivity during stability periods.

Mathematical programming for piecewise linear regression analysis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												In data mining, regression analysis is a computational tool that predicts continuous output variables from a number of independent input variables, by approximating their complex inner relationship. A large number of methods have been successfully proposed, based on various methodologies, including linear regression, support vector regression, neural network, piece-wise regression, etc. In terms of piece-wise regression, the existing methods in literature are usually restricted to problems of very small scale, due to their inherent non-linear nature. In this work, a more efficient piece-wise linear regression method is introduced based on a novel integer linear programming formulation. The proposed method partitions one input variable into multiple mutually exclusive segments, and fits one multivariate linear regression function per segment to minimise the total absolute error. Assuming both the single partition feature and the number of regions are known, the mixed integer linear model is proposed to simultaneously determine the locations of multiple break-points and regression coefficients for each segment. Furthermore, an efficient heuristic procedure is presented to identify the key partition feature and final number of break-points. 7 real world problems covering several application domains have been used to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method. It is shown that our propbsed piece-wise regression method can be solved to global optimality for datasets of thousands samples, which also consistently achieves higher prediction accuracy than a number of state-of-the-art regression methods. Another advantage of the proposed method is that the learned model can be conveniently expressed as a small number of if-then rules that are easily interpretable. Overall, this work proposes an efficient rule-based multivariate regression method based on piece-wise functions and achieves better prediction performance than state-of-the-arts approaches. This novel method can benefit expert systems in various applications by automatically acquiring knowledge from databases to improve the quality of knowledge base. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A two-tier control architecture for nonlinear process systems with continuous/asynchronous feedback	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL												In this work, we introduce a two-tier control architecture for nonlinear process systems with both continuous and asynchronous sensing and actuation. This class of systems arises naturally in the context of process control systems based on hybrid communication networks (i.e. point-to-point wired links integrated with networked wired or wireless communication) and utilising multiple heterogeneous measurements (e.g. temperature and concentration). Assuming that there exists a lower-tier control system which relies on point-to-point communication and continuous measurements to stabilise the closed-loop system, we propose to use Lyapunov-based model predictive control to design an upper-tier networked control system to profit from both the continuous and the asynchronous measurements as well as from additional networked control actuators. The proposed two-tier control system architecture preserves the stability properties of the lower-tier controller while improving the closed-loop performance. The theoretical results are demonstrated using two different chemical process examples.

In contrast to the majority of earlier approaches, system modeling and policy design do not assume simplified system structure, such as a serial, or a tree-like one. The network nodes, in addition to satisfying market demand, answer internal requests with delay spanning multiple periods. The stock in the network is refilled from uncapacited outside sources. A dynamic model of the considered class of goods distribution systems is constructed and a new inventory policy is formulated. The proposed policy shares similarity with the classical order-up-to one, yet provide improved performance owing to the networked perspective assumed in the design process.

The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to represent the underlying nonlinear dynamics. A multi-channel communication scheme that involves a channel switching phenomenon described by a Markov chain is proposed for data transmission. Two typical communication imperfections, network-induced time-varying delays and packet dropouts are considered in each channel. The objective of this paper is to design an admissible filter such that the filter error system is stochasticallystable and ensures a prescribed disturbance attenuation level bound. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method and matrix inequality techniques, sufficient conditions on the existence of the desired filter are obtained.

Current approaches in density-based TO for FRC use the underlying finite element mesh both for analysis and design representation. This poses several limitations while enforcing sub-element fiber spacing and generating high-resolution continuous fibers. In contrast, we propose a mesh-independent representation based on a neural network (NN) both to capture the matrix topology and fiber distribution. The implicit NN-based representation enables geometric and material queries at a higher resolution than a mesh discretization. This leads to the accurate extraction of functionally-graded continuous fibers. Further, by integrating the finite element simulations into the NN computational framework, we can leverage automatic differentiation for end-to-end automated sensitivity analysis, i.e., we no longer need to manually derive cumbersome sensitivity expressions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed method through several numerical examples involving various objective functions. We also show that the optimized continuous fiber reinforced composites can be directly fabricated at high resolution using additive manufacturing.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yin, RY; Liu, ZY; Zheng, N				Yin, Ruyang; Liu, Zhiyuan; Zheng, Nan			A Simulation-Based Model for Continuous Network Design Problem Using Bayesian Optimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS												This paper investigates the continuous network design problem (CNDP) and proposes a simulation-based bi-level model and solution framework based on Bayesian optimization. In the bi-level model, the upper level minimizes the total system cost, and the lower level assigns traffic under an approximated dynamic equilibrium condition corresponding to the given network design strategy. A simulation tool integrated micro- and macro- traffic dynamics, namely SUMO, is employed to solve the lower-level problem. The embedded high-fidelity, non-linear understanding of traffic in the simulator oftentimes gains additional complexity due to the lack of tractable mathematical representation. Thus, a Bayesian machine learning technique is utilized to build the link between simulation and optimization. The proposed solution framework takes both the advantages of fine-grained simulations and the efficiency of surrogate-based optimization techniques. Moreover, lane width expansion is innovatively proposed as the decision variable of CNDP to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The relationship between link free-flow speed (FFS) and lane width is also explored based on real data and established to accurately calibrate the simulation input. For demonstrative purposes, numerical experiments on the optimal lane width expansion design were conducted in the inner city of Suzhou, China. The results show that with proper parameter settings, the proposed method is capable to find the global optimal solution within a very tight computational budget, which makes the simulation-based framework an encouraging option for policymakers to enhance transportation network performance.																			1524-9050	1558-0016				NOV	2022	23	11					20352	20367		10.1109/TITS.2022.3176918	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3176918		MAY 2022											WOS:000809396700001

The scheme allows existing preinstalled capacities. Starting with an initial aggregation, we solve a sequence of network design master problems over increasingly fine-grained representations of the original network. In each step, a subproblem is solved that either proves optimality of the solution or gives a directive where to refine the representation of the network in the subsequent iteration. The algorithm terminates with a globally optimal solution to the original problem. Our implementation uses a standard integer programming solver for solving the master problems as well as the subproblems. The computational results on random and realistic instances confirm the profitable use of the iterative aggregation technique. The computing time often reduces drastically when our method is compared to solving the original problem from scratch.

J	Toso, G; Angeletti, P				Toso, Giovanni; Angeletti, Piero			An Optimal Procedure for the Design of Discrete Constrained Lens Antennas with Minimized Optical Aberrations. Part II: Three-Dimensional Multifocal Architectures	ELECTRONICS												Novel three-dimensional discrete lens antennas characterized by a number of focal points ranging from one to five and defined explicitly via analytical equations are presented in the paper. A procedure to derive rotationally symmetric afocal lenses starting from multifocal lenses that are not rotationally symmetric is proposed as well. In addition, an innovative method to identify the focal surface minimizing the optical aberrations is derived. The lenses are compared in terms of optical aberrations and accommodation constraints. The most suitable lens architectures depend mainly on the required angular field of view and magnification factor. It is shown that a reduction by a factor close to 3 in the optical aberrations can be obtained when selecting the most appropriate lens architecture and keeping comparable accommodation constraints. The results, derived exploiting a geometrical optics (GO) formulation, provide useful indications for the preliminary design of constrained lens antennas before adopting full wave rigorous techniques. Three-dimensional discrete lens antennas can offer significant advantages as compared to conventional analog beamforming networks (as those based on Butler matrixes) in terms of frequency bandwidth, number of beams and number of radiating elements.					toso, giovanni/AAL-1704-2021	Toso, Giovanni/0000-0002-0301-5289														2079-9292				FEB	2022	11	3							503	10.3390/electronics11030503	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11030503													WOS:000755066900001

J	Qin, D				Qin, Dong			Resource allocation of cognitive relay networks under continuous transmission mechanism	HELIYON												This paper considers the joint power allocation, path selection and subcarrier pairing design of cognitive radio cooperative networks, where the transmission power of secondary users is limited by its own power budget and the tolerable interference threshold of primary users. In particular, a continuous transmission mechanism rather than intermittent emission, leading to severe signal interference between primary and secondary users, as well as mutual interference between secondary users, is taken into account. This cooperative cognitive radio network is seen as an improvement in the sense that the source transmitter can continuously transmit symbols without silence. Although traditional cooperative network technology has long been applied to the cognitive radio field and it has been proposed to allow continuous transmission signals by source transmitter, the deployment of such improved cooperative behavior in cognitive radio networks has not been reported yet. This improvement assumption may render serious mutual interference between the relay station and the destination receiver, and the signal interference borne by the primary user will also exceed the threshold value, if there is no elaborate signal design and resource scheduling. In order to make full use of the available resources, this paper presents the closed -form solution of the power allocation, the decision criteria of the path selection and the subcarrier pairing technique for the problem of maximization of the sum rate of secondary users in such networks under the dual constraints of the power budget and the interference threshold. Simulation results show that the continuous transmission behavior at the source significantly outperforms the traditional switching back and forth between on and off.																				2405-8440				MAY 15	2024	10	9							e30672	10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30672								38765123					WOS:001239246200001

The key to this lies in how to place each VNF (virtual network function) on an adequate server among pools in conjunction with design of paths connecting servers with OLTs (optical line terminals). There have been extensive studies regarding VNF placement problems, but few have investigated the optimal placement of VNFs in consideration of carrier edge function virtualization. We thus study a design problem of carrier edge VNF placement in an optical aggregation network. We formulate a design problem as MILP (mixed-integer linear programming) and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through intensive mathematical experiments. The experiments showed that the proposed method reduced the maximum server load and network cost by up to by 29% and 21%, respectively.

When a given service is highly demanded, some demands may be unmet due to the limited capacity of the network links. Moreover, for such demands, telecommunication operators should pay penalty costs. To avoid rejecting demands, we can install more capacities in the existing network. In this paper we report experiments on the network capacity design for uncertain demand in telecommunication networks with integer link capacities. We use Poisson demands with bandwidths given by normal or log-normal distribution functions. The expectation function is evaluated using a predetermined set of realizations of the random parameter. We model this problem as a two-stage mixed integer program, which is solved using a stochastic subgradient procedure, the Barahona's volume approach and the Benders decomposition.

By breaking the continuity of location exposure and changing pseudonyms, this strategy can effectively keep users from tracking attacks. Existing Mix-Zone evaluation mechanisms are mainly divided into two categories - Calculation and vehicle tracking. Calculation based evaluation methods like K-anonymity and Entropy are more suitable for qualitative analysis and comparison, but lacks accuracy and quantitative criteria, whereas existing tracking methods are too simple to accurately quantify the privacy of the Mix-Zone. Accordingly, it is urgent to bring up more accurate tracking methods to get a better view of the Mix-Zone's privacy. In this paper, we propose two categories of Mix-Zone tracking methods based on the basic BP and the customized artificial neural networks, where the former is used as verification and based on the result analysis of which we designed the latter, which greatly improves the tracking result, revealing the privacy preserving level of the Mix-Zone more reasonably.

The considered systems are of the nonaffine pure-feedback form and the dead-zone input appears nonlinearly in the systems. The contributions of the paper are that: 1) it is for the first time to investigate the control problem for this class of discrete-time systems with dead-zone; 2) there are major difficulties for stabilizing such systems and in order to overcome the difficulties, the systems are transformed into an n-step-ahead predictor but nonaffine function is still existent; and 3) an adaptive compensative term is constructed to compensate for the parameters of the dead-zone. The neural networks are used to approximate the unknown functions in the transformed systems. Based on the Lyapunov theory, it is proven that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero.

A mixed-integer optimization framework for the synthesis and analysis of regulatory networks	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION												Motivation: A novel mixed-integer optimization framework is proposed for the design and analysis of regulatory networks. The model combines gene expression data and prior biological knowledge regarding the potential for regulatory interactions between genes and their corresponding transcription factors. The formalism provides significant advantages over available modeling methodologies in that the complexity of the regulatory network can be explicitly taken into account, multiple alternative structures can be systematically generated and finally robust and biological significant regulators can be rigorously identified. The original non-convex mixed integer reformulation is appropriately linearized and the resulting MILP is effectively optimized using standard solvers.

Some slack matrices and the bound information in membership functions are introduced to obtain the relaxed sufficient conditions formed by the linear matrix inequalities, which guarantee the anticipant H-infinity performance.

The proposed mmCMD visualizes the micro-Doppler signatures of continuous motions generated from millimeter radar as images, which are then analyzed by an object detection network for continuous motion detection. To improve the imaging quality of micro-Doppler signatures, a dynamic feature visualization (DFV) method is proposed by selectively mapping the micro-Doppler matrix (MDM) elements with significant values, highlighting human motion to enhance subsequent detection network's accuracy in capturing the details of the motion. Furthermore, a novel detection network is designed for the visualized micro-Doppler images by combining the specially designed fusion squeeze-and-excitation (FSE) module with the coordinate attention (CA) into the YOLOv5 architecture, which is distinct from prior works that overlook global contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mmCMD achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 93% at the intersection over union (IoU) thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 and an F1 score of 99% for 12 actions, which makes it a promising solution for remotely monitoring and detecting elderly individuals' activities to enhance safety and risk prevention capabilities.																			1530-437X	1558-1748				FEB 1	2024	24	3					3394	3405		10.1109/JSEN.2023.3342103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2023.3342103													WOS:001243040000093

In all-optical networks, optical amplifiers consume much power to amplify a group of optical signals with different wavelengths. The FWM is one of the most important physical impairments to be resolved in all-optical networks because the FWM induces nonlinear inter-channel crosstalk and decays the performance of all-optical networks. The proposed scheme provides an ingenious route, wavelength, fiber selection strategy aiming to minimize the power consumption of optical amplifiers while suppressing the accumulation of the FWM crosstalk effect. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.																			2326-2338		978-1-4673-6945-9				2015																								WOS:000378429800008

It powers our homes, offices, and industries and runs various forms of transportation. This paper considers an electric power supply chain network design problem featuring differential pricing and preventive maintenance. We demonstrate that this general model can be formulated as the centralized and decentralized supply chain models. A continuous approximation approach is used to model the problems. The objective of these models is to determine the optimal power plants' service area, electricity price, and preventive maintenance budget while maximizing the total network profit or the own organization's benefits. Our model is applied to the case of a power company in northern Vietnam. We show that the proposed approach can be used to address real-world cases effectively. The results demonstrate that the use of differential pricing policy and preventive maintenance could much enhance power company profit.

The uncertainty is assumed to be of structured linear fractional form, which includes the norm-bounded uncertainty as a special case. A stability condition is first proposed by using switched Lyapunov function, which is dependent on the minimum and maximum delay bounds.

However, with the continuous improvement of model structure and spatial resolution, incorporation of these additional degrees of freedom into fidelity assessment has become increasingly challenging. Here, we propose a new method to provide information on the model predictive skill in a concise way. The method is based on the conjoint use of a k-means clustering technique, assessment metrics, and Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) observations. The k-means algorithm and the assessment metrics reduce the number of model data points to be evaluated. The metrics evaluate either the model state accuracy or the skill of the model with respect to capturing emergent properties, such as the deep chlorophyll maximums and oxygen minimum zones. The use of BGC-Argo observations as the sole evaluation data set ensures the accuracy of the data, as it is a homogenous data set with strict sampling methodologies and data quality control procedures. The method is applied to the Global Ocean Biogeochemistry Analysis and Forecast system of the Copernicus Marine Service. The model performance is evaluated using the model efficiency statistical score, which compares the model-observation misfit with the variability in the observations and, thus, objectively quantifies whether the model outperforms the BGC-Argo climatology. We show that, overall, the model surpasses the BGC-Argo climatology in predicting pH, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, oxygen, nitrate, and phosphate in the mesopelagic and the mixed layers as well as silicate in the mesopelagic layer. However, there are still areas for improvement with respect to reducing the model-data misfit for certain variables such as silicate, pH, and the partial pressure of CO2 in the mixed layer as well as chlorophyll-a-related, oxygen-minimumzone-related, and particulate-organic-carbon-related metrics. The method proposed here can also aid in refining the design of the BGC-Argo network, in particular regarding the regions in which BGC-Argo observations should be enhanced to improve the model accuracy via the assimilation of BGC-Argo data or process-oriented assessment studies. We strongly recommend increasing the number of observations in the Arctic region while maintaining the existing high-density of observations in the Southern Oceans. The model error in these regions is only slightly less than the variability observed in BGC-Argo measurements. Our study illustrates how the synergic use of modeling and BGC-Argo data can both provide information about the performance of models and improve the design of observing systems.

It mainly helps to reduce the dead loads of the structure, which ultimately reduces design load requirements. The main challenge associated with lightweight aggregate concrete is finding an optimized mix per requirements. However, the conventional material design of this composite is quite costly, time-consuming, and iterative. This research proposes a simplified methodology for the mix designing of structural and non-structural lightweight aggregate concrete by incorporating machine learning. For this purpose, five distinct machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), Gaussian process of regression (GPR), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) algorithms, were investigated. For the training, testing, and validation process, a total of 420 data points were collected from 43 published journal articles. The performance of models was evaluated based on statistical performance indicators. Overall, 11 input parameters, including ingredients of the concrete mix and aggregate properties were entertained; the only output parameter was the compressive strength of lightweight concrete. The results revealed that the GPR model outperformed the remaining four machine learning models by attaining an R-2 value of 0.99, RMSE of 1.34, MSE of 1.79, and MAE of 0.69. In a nutshell, these simplified modern techniques can be employed to make the design of lightweight aggregate concrete easy without extensive experimentation.

ADDN Study Grp	Diabetic Ketoacidosis at Onset of Type 1 Diabetes and Long-term HbA<sub>1c</sub> in 7,961 Children and Young Adults in the Australasian Diabetes Data Network	DIABETES CARE												OBJECTIVE The relationship between diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and long-term glycemic control varies between studies. We aimed, firstly, to characterize the association of DKA and its severity with long-term HbA(1c) in a large contemporary cohort, and secondly, to identify other independent determinants of long-term HbA(1c). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were 7,961 children and young adults diagnosed with type 1 diabetes by age 30 years from 2000 to 2019 and followed prospectively in the Australasian Diabetes Data Network (ADDN) until 31 December 2020. Linear mixed-effect models related variables to HbA(1c). RESULTS DKA at diagnosis was present in 2,647 participants (33.2%). Over a median 5.6 (interquartile range 3.2, 9.4) years of follow-up, participants with severe, but not moderate or mild, DKA at diagnosis had a higher mean HbA(1c) (+0.23%, 95% CI 0.11,0.28; [+2.5 mmol/mol, 95% CI 1.4,3.6]; P < 0.001) compared with those without DKA. Use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) was independently associated with a lower HbA(1c) (-0.28%, 95% CI -0.31, -0.25; [-3.1 mmol/mol, 95% CI -3.4, -2.8]; P < 0.001) than multiple daily injections, and CSII use interacted with severe DKA to lower predicted HbA(1c). Indigenous status was associated with higher HbA(1c) (+1.37%, 95% CI 1.15, 1.59; [+15.0 mmol/mol, 95% CI 12.6, 17.4]; P < 0.001), as was residing in postcodes of lower socioeconomic status (most vs. least disadvantaged quintile +0.43%, 95% CI 0.34, 0.52; [+4.7 mmol/mol, 95% CI 3.4, 5.6]; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Severe, but not mild or moderate, DKA at diagnosis was associated with a marginally higher HbA(1c) over time, an effect that was modified by use of CSII. Indigenous status and lower socioeconomic status were independently associated with higher long-term HbA(1c).

First, a completely novel lemma is introduced to prove the fixed-time stability of the equilibrium of a general ordinary differential system, which is less conservative and has a simpler form than those in the existing literature. Then, sufficient conditions are presented to realize synchronization of a complex network (with a target system) within a settling time via three different kinds of simple controllers. In general, controllers designed to achieve fixed-time stability consist of three terms and are discontinuous. However, in our mechanisms, the controllers only contain two terms or even one term and are continuous. Thus, our controllers are simpler and of more practical applicability. Finally, three examples are provided to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of our results.

By formulating the three communication constraints phenomena into a stochastic parameter uncertainty system, a linear filter is designed to satisfy that the error state of the filtering process is mean square bounded, and the steady-state variance of the estimation error for each state is not more than the individual prescribed upper bound. Based on existing positive definite solutions for a couple of algebraic Riccati-like inequalities or linear matrix inequalities, the theory of robust filter design is given and the process for solving filter parameters is proposed.

While prevalent approaches often employ complex, multiphase processes to delineate the boundaries of these objects, enabling effective monitoring, they may not be ideally suited for time-sensitive situations, where a rapid response often outweighs the need for extreme precision. To address this gap, we introduce a streamlined boundary tracking algorithm, the centroid computation of feasible region for continuous object tracking (CCFR-COT), intended for unmanned surface vessel (USV)-assisted UASNs. This algorithm utilizes a fundamental full binary tree-structured network configuration along with two of its variations, designed to handle cases where continuous objects disperse in either free space or two semi-infinite spaces. The chosen network configuration aids in the selection of boundary mapping cells, thereby sketching a coarse-grained feasible region that envelops the actual boundary. Sequentially visiting these cells, the USV systematically constructs and deconstructs convex hulls of sensor nodes to progressively reduce location uncertainty within the feasible region. Only the centroid of the final feasible region in each boundary mapping cell is output for boundary fitting. Both experimental and simulated results validate the streamlined design of the CCFR-COT, which ensures timely tracking results and provides a balance between rapid response and tracking accuracy.

Herein, a continuous magnesium fluoride (MgF2) network structure is designed and induced into Mg alloy to improve the degradation resistance. For this purpose, Mg alloy particles are first treated by hydrofluoric acid (HF) and then used to prepare alloys via selective laser melting (SLM). The results show that an intact and tightly packed MgF2 layer generates on the surface of Mg alloy particles. After SLM, the alloy presents a continuous network structure, in which Mg alloy matrix is encapsulated in the network units constructed by MgF2. Owing to the high corrosion resistance and chemical inertness of MgF2, the continuous network structure resists the erosion of corrosion medium and decreases the degradation rate of Mg alloy by 21%. In addition, cell fluorescence and viability results show that the network structure encapsulated Mg alloy exhibits improved cell proliferation and adhesion ability, indicating better biocompatibility. These findings show that the airtight network structure might be a good way to improve the degradation resistance of Mg alloys for biomedical applications.

J	Gao, Z				Gao, Zhe			A Tuning Method via Borges Derivative of a Neural Network-Based Discrete-Time Fractional-Order PID Controller with Hausdorff Difference and Hausdorff Sum	FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL												In this paper, the fractal derivative is introduced into a neural network-based discrete-time fractional-order PID controller in two areas, namely, in the controller's structure and in the parameter optimization algorithm. The first use of the fractal derivative is to reconstruct the fractional-order PID controller by using the Hausdorff difference and Hausdorff sum derived from the Hausdorff derivative and Hausdorff integral. It can avoid the derivation of the Gamma function for the order updating to realize the parameter and order tuning based on neural networks. The other use is the optimization of order and parameters by using Borges derivative. Borges derivative is a kind of fractal derivative as a local fractional-order derivative. The chain rule of composite function is consistent with the integral-order derivative. It is suitable for updating the parameters and the order of the fractional-order PID controller based on neural networks.

Exponential extended dissipative performance for delayed discrete-time neural networks under memoryless resilient-based observer design	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												This paper is concerned with the problem of exponentially extended dissipative criteria for a class of delayed discrete-time neural networks (DNNs) subject to resilient observer-based controller design. For this objective, a memoryless full-order Luenberger state observer is designed, and further, its observer error system is calculated with resilient control. Initially, some new improved weighted summation inequalities are proposed by combining weighted summation inequality and an extended reciprocal convex matrix inequality. By constructing the suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and utilizing the developed summation inequalities, the exponentially extended dissipative criterion is obtained for the considered delayed DNNs. The designed observer and resilient control gain matrices can be determined by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) subject to the prescribed exponential decay rate. Finally, two numerical examples are carried out to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the established theoretical results obtained through the newly developed summation inequalities.

The objectives are to minimize the network model size with minimum training error at the same time, causing a conflict between the two objectives in the design problem. To address this problem, the multi-objective, rule-coded, advanced, continuous-ant-colony optimization (MO-RACACO) is applied to design FNNs in this paper. The MO-RACACO-designed FNNs are applied to time sequence prediction and nonlinear control problems to verify its performance. Performance of this approach is verified through three simulation examples with comparisons with various multi-objective population-based optimization algorithms and detailed discussions of the results. The results show that the MO-RACACO-based FNN design approach outperforms the multi-objective population-based algorithms used for comparisons in the control and prediction examples.

Recent contributions to the optimal design of pipeline networks in the energy industry using mathematical programming	TOP												The optimal design of pipeline networks has inspired process systems engineers and operations research practitioners since the earliest times of mathematical programming. The nonlinear equations governing pressure drops, energy consumption and capital investments have motivated nonlinear programming (NLP) approaches and solution techniques, as well as mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulations and decomposition strategies. In this overview paper, we present a systematic description of the mathematical models proposed in recent years for the optimal design of pipeline networks in the energy industry. We provide a general framework to address these problems based on both the topology of the network to build, and the physical properties of the fluids to transport. We illustrate the computational challenges through several examples from industry collaboration projects, published in recent papers from our research group.

J	Sciubba, E				Sciubba, Enrico			A Critical Reassessment of the Hess-Murray Law	ENTROPY												The Hess-Murray law is a correlation between the radii of successive branchings in bi/trifurcated vessels in biological tissues. First proposed by the Swiss physiologist and Nobel laureate Walter Rudolf Hess in his 1914 doctoral thesis and published in 1917, the law was "rediscovered" by the American physiologist Cecil Dunmore Murray in 1926. The law is based on the assumption that blood or lymph circulation in living organisms is governed by a "work minimization" principle that-under a certain set of specified conditions-leads to an "optimal branching ratio" of r(i+1)/r(i) = 1/(3)root 2 = 0.7937. This "cubic root of 2" correlation underwent extensive theoretical and experimental reassessment in the second half of the 20th century, and the results indicate that-under a well-defined series of conditions-the law is sufficiently accurate for the smallest vessels (r of the order of fractions of millimeter) but fails for the larger ones; moreover, it cannot be successfully extended to turbulent flows. Recent comparisons with numerical investigations of branched flows led to similar conclusions. More recently, the Hess-Murray law came back into the limelight when it was taken as a founding paradigm of the Constructal Law, a theory that employs physical intuition and mathematical reasoning to derive "optimal paths" for the transport of matter and energy between a source and a sink, regardless of the mode of transportation (continuous, like in convection and conduction, or discrete, like in the transportation of goods and people). This paper examines the foundation of the law and argues that both for natural flows and for engineering designs, a minimization of the irreversibility under physically sound boundary conditions leads to somewhat different results. It is also shown that, in the light of an exergy-based resource analysis, an amended version of the Hess-Murray law may still hold an important position in engineering and biological sciences.

The C-RAN technology will reduce operating costs, improve energy efficiency, and support enhanced capacity and coverage by taking advantage of centralized processing. However, C-RAN requires strict latency bounds on the fronthaul network that connects the distributed radio units and the central processing units. Instead of deploying dedicated fronthaul transport networks, the reuse of existing backhaul transport networks to carry fronthaul data needs to be leveraged. In this paper, we study the end-to-end delay bounds for a mixed fronthaul and backhaul 5G network. Deterministic network calculus is used to derive worst-case delay bounds in a mixed transport network, and this is verified using a C-RAN experimental testbed with real traffic characteristics. The impact on end-to-end delay due to the effect of multiplexing fronthaul and diurnal backhaul traffic in business and residential regions is studied analytically. We also propose a framework to determine the choice of enabling the appropriate fronthaul split at the distributed radio units and the central processing units to meet the latency requirements. The proposed network calculus based framework can be utilized by network engineers while designing the future 5G transport network deployments.																					978-1-7281-7374-0				2020							205	214		10.1109/WoWMoM49955.2020.00048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM49955.2020.00048													WOS:000628967700033

With the continuous improvement of users' requirements for network quality of service, it is a challenging task to quickly recover from the network congestion state to the normal network state. In the framework of backstepping, this paper studies how to realize congestion control according to the network state. The basic idea is to introduce a new nonautonomous differential equation to compensate the shortcomings of the existing arbitrary convergence time controller, and integrate it into the design of congestion controller to realize free-will arbitrary time congestion control. In order to reduce the packet loss rate and avoid reducing network efficiency caused by a large number of packet retransmissions, a finite-time performance function is introduced in the design process. The results show that using the proposed congestion mechanism, the congestion control problem with prescribed settling time can be solved by a nonpiecewise continuous arbitrary convergence time control law. The arbitrary time convergence of the system state is proved theoretically. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by simulations and compared with related work.

This can be challenging at locations with scarce rockfall records and where block surveys are not feasible. This paper describes and validates a method for estimating rockfall block volumes, based on structural mapping using on photogrammetric techniques. The method can be used for dimensioning rockfall protection structures in cases where data is scarce or not available. The design of rockfall protection structures requires information about the falling block volumes. Computational tools for rockfall trajectory simulation are now capable of modeling block fragmentation, requiring the fragmented volume-relative frequency distribution of rockfalls as input. This can be challenging at locations with scarce or nonexistent rockfall records and where block surveys are not feasible. The work in this paper shows that simple discrete fracture network realizations from structural mapping based on photogrammetric techniques can be used to reliably estimate rock fall block volumes. These estimates can be used for dimensioning rockfall protection structures in cases where data is scarce or not available. The methodology is tested at two sites in the Canadian Cordillera where limestone outcrops have been the source of recurrent rockfalls. The results suggest that fragmentation will largely tend to occur through weak planes and expansion of non-persistent discontinuities, while other block breakage mechanisms exert less influence in the fragmented volume-relative frequency distribution of rockfalls. Therefore, block volume distribution can be estimated using a simple discrete fracture network (DFN) with fully persistent discontinuities. Limitations of the methods are also discussed, as well as potential future research to address such limitations.																				2076-3417				OCT	2020	10	19							6977	10.3390/app10196977	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10196977													WOS:000586734700001
J	Aman, S; Seuring, S				Aman, Sadaf; Seuring, Stefan			Analysing developing countries approaches of supply chain resilience to COVID-19	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT												Purpose The Covid-19 pandemic has made it essential to explore the resilience factors specific to developing regions, not only because they pose threats of extreme poverty and offer a novel context but also because they play an important role in globalisation. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach was undertaken to address this novel pandemic situation. First, an open-ended structured questionnaire was developed, and data were collected from three neighbouring emerging economies: Pakistan, India and Iran. Experts' perspectives on vulnerabilities, response measures, resilience and restoration of supply chain activities, and the role of social capital were collected. Second, building upon the findings from phase one of the studies, a quantitative structured questionnaire using the supply chain operational reference (SCOR) model was used to collect data in a structured manner. This quantitative data were further analysed using frequency and contingency analysis. Findings The findings from the first phase of the study inductively derive 36 resilience categories. Later, the contingency findings show that supply chain (SC) disruption is a major vulnerability for emerging economies, whereas solutions offered to combat it lay in the reconfiguration of resources, such as financial, technological, human, information and material. Additionally, supply network structure and social capital play an integral part in making SCs resilient against disruption. Research limitations/implications The respondents comprise the academics/SC researchers, which make the findings interesting though they lack the industrial experts' perspectives, directly. Nevertheless, the propositions can be tested in industrial settings to see whether the results are limited to a specific industrial setting or are rather generalised. Practical implications Similarly, practitioners and policy makers can incorporate the SCOR metrics/factors outlined in this study into their performance measurement systems and ensure continuous monitoring for firm's resilience. Originality/value The study offers a holistic understanding of the developing regions' approaches to Covid-19. The paper also takes a social capital perspective to explain firms' resilience in these emerging economies.

As a result, telecom operators need to upgrade their transport networks to cope with these new traffic requirements. This tremendous increase in bandwidth demand will also introduce energy bottlenecks in OTNs. The telecommunication networks' significant Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE) is another challenge that must be addressed in OTN design and planning policies. Thus, energy-efficient OTN architectures are currently attracting the attention of telecom operators. The candidate OTN architectures are: (1) the conventional Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) fixed grid with high Single Line Rates (SLRs); (2) the conventional DWDM fixed grid adopting Mixed Line Rates (MLRs); and (3) the Elastic Optical Network (EON) or flexigrid-based architecture which is enabled by the Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (O-OFDM) technique. This paper evaluates the power consumption of the abovementioned OTN architectures under different traffic loads and patterns, as well as different network physical topologies. In order to perform the evaluation, new heuristic algorithms are specifically developed for the green design and planning of data center optical interconnects.																					978-1-5090-0679-3				2016							675	682																WOS:000386979000112

J	Mashayekh, S; Stadler, M; Cardoso, G; Heleno, M				Mashayekh, Salman; Stadler, Michael; Cardoso, Goncalo; Heleno, Miguel			A mixed integer linear programming approach for optimal DER portfolio, sizing, and placement in multi-energy microgrids	APPLIED ENERGY												Optimal microgrid design is a challenging problem, especially for multi-energy microgrids with electricity, heating, and cooling loads as well as sources, and multiple energy carriers. To address this problem, this paper presents an optimization model formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which determines the optimal technology portfolio, the optimal technology placement, and the associated optimal dispatch, in a microgrid with multiple energy types. The developed model uses a multi-node modeling approach (as opposed to an aggregate single-node approach) that includes electrical power flow and heat flow equations, and hence, offers the ability to perform optimal siting considering physical and operational constraints of electrical and heating/cooling networks. The new model is founded on the existing optimization model DER-CAM, a state-of-the-art decision support tool for microgrid planning and design. The results of a case study that compares single-node vs. multi-node optimal design for an example microgrid show the importance of multi-node modeling. It has been shown that single-node approaches are not only incapable of optimal DER placement, but may also result in sub-optimal DER portfolio, as well as underestimation of investment costs.

In response to the inefficiency of existing greedy algorithms and the low accuracy of centrality-based heuristics, we propose an improved differential evolution algorithm (IDDE) based on the network discretization in this paper. The algorithm improves the variance rule of the differential evolution algorithm, takes the discrete number and discrete granularity of the remaining network after the removal of the target node as the index to evaluate the importance of the node, and proposes a fitness function based on the robustness of the network. The method embodies symmetry in two aspects. Firstly, the global connectivity among nodes in the network decreases as the number of target nodes removed in the social network increases. Secondly, the gain of global influence range gradually becomes smaller as the number of target nodes screened by the proposed method increases. We conducted comparison experiments on four real datasets of different sizes, and the results show that the IDDE algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithm.

Access to network services has become an integral component of these applications. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a QoS-aware Networking Application Programming Interface (API) which provides a simple interface to access network services with QoS requirements. Moreover, our design exploits Java for portability and low-level native APIs such as Winsock 2 (on Windows systems) and BSD Sockets ton UNIX systems) for basic networking functions. To evaluate our API design and implementation, we present latency performance results over protocols such ar TCP/IP and UDP/IP over ATM. We also demonstrate the impact of this API on jitter performance for continuous media applications such as those involving real-time digital video.																					1-892512-15-7				1999							475	481																WOS:000167653300070

Nevertheless, maintaining these properties within SDN networks poses challenges due to flexibility and programmability of SDN, which can result in an increased frequency of network updates. While existing research has introduced mechanisms to uphold consistency during network transitions, they often overlook the consideration of flow priority when scheduling forwarding rules. We address this problem with pUpdate, a framework designed to facilitate consistent and continuous network updates while accounting for flow priority in the scheduling of forwarding rules within SDN. We have developed pUpdate and rigorously evaluated its performance through simulations. The measurements demonstrate that pUpdate adheres to priority-based scheduling without any degradation in network update performance when compared to state-of-the-art approaches in SDN network update.																			2165-9605		978-3-903176-59-1				2023																								WOS:001117985100031

They consider a profit-oriented objective that measure the tradeoff between the revenue due to served commodities and the overall network design and transportation costs. An exact algorithmic framework is proposed for two variants of this class of problems, where a sophisticated Lagrangian function that exploits the structure of the problems is used to efficiently obtain bounds at the nodes of an enumeration tree. In addition, reduction tests and partial enumerations are used to considerably reduce the size of the problems and thus help decrease the computational effort. Numerical results on a set of benchmark instances with up to 100 nodes confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithmic framework. The proposed methodology can be used as a tool to solve more complex variants of this class of problems as well as other discrete location and network design problems involving servicing decisions.

Integrating Simulation in Optimal Synthesis and Design of Natural Gas Upstream Processing Networks	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												A natural gas upstream processing network consists of several main processing units. Many process configurations are available for selection, and the choice of technologies can be vast. There is no single technology or process configuration that is superior in all aspects. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical model that considers different flowsheet configurations and operating mode options and selects optimally among them. In this paper, a comprehensive design and operational mixed integer programming model is presented for superstructure optimization to optimally select the most cost-effective pathway in natural gas upstream processing networks. The key processing units of the considered processing network include stabilization, acid gas removal, dehydration, sulfur recovery, natural gas liquid (NGL) recovery, and NGL fractionation. The developed optimization model considers a superstructure with all available technologies for each processing step as well as mode of operation, such as variations in temperature and pressure which impacts the product yields. These units have been simulated using ASPEN Plus to determine the yields of different units for each design alternative under different operating modes. The bilinear terms in the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model are linearized based on either input or output streams, whichever are less in number. The model has been applied to design and operate optimally the natural gas upstream processing network. Two illustrative case studies are presented to show the applicability of the overall framework and formulated models.

Using stochastic geometry and queueing theory, we develop a spatiotemporal model to derive the steady state distribution of the number of packets in the buffers and energy levels in the batteries of IoT devices given that the IoT and cellular communications are allocated disjoint spectrum. Particularly, each IoT device is modeled via a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov Chain (DTMC) that jointly tracks the evolution of data buffer and energy battery. In this context, stochastic geometry is used to derive the energy generation at the batteries and the packet transmission probability from buffers taking into account the mutual interference from other active IoT devices. To this end, we show the Pareto-Frontiers of the sustainability region, which defines the network parameters that ensure stable network operation and finite packet delay.

This paper jointly characterizes the harvested energy and the packet transmission success probability in grant-free uplink IoT networks energized via harvesting downlink energy. To do that, a joint queueing theory and stochastic geometry model is exploited and a spatiotemporal analytical model is developed accordingly. Particularly, the harvested energy and packet transmission success probability are characterized using tools from stochastic geometry. Moreover, each device is modeled using a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) to track the time evolution of the joint states of the scavenged energy and the data buffer. Consequently, the adopted queueing model represents the devices as spatially interacting queues. To that end, the network performance is assessed in light of the packet throughput, the average waiting time, and the average buffer size which offer valuable insights for network design.

J	Yan, L; Zhang, SJ; Wei, GL; Liu, S				Yan, Le; Zhang, Sunjie; Wei, Guoliang; Liu, Shuai			Event-triggered set-membership filtering for discrete-time memristive neural networks subject to measurement saturation and fadings	NEUROCOMPUTING												In this paper, the set-membership (SM) filtering problem is investigated for a class of discrete time-delayed memristive neural networks (MNNs) with unknown-but-bounded disturbances. The output measurements are subject to saturation, whose transmission is governed by a predetermined event-triggered strategy. In addition, the communication channel is usually fading, which is described by a set of stochastic variables taking different values in the interval [0,1]. The nonlinear activation function and the saturation function are assumed to satisfy the Lipschitz-like and sector conditions, respectively. The purpose of this paper is to design an event-triggered (ET) filter to estimate the certain region which includes the real states while guaranteeing the benefits of resource conservations. Via recursive linear matrix inequalities, some sufficient conditions are derived to optimize the estimation elliptic sets. Furthermore, the design of the optimal SM filter for MNNs is recast as solving a convex optimization problem via the semidefinite programming method. Finally, a persuasive simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the designed filtering algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions and using inequality technique, two different types of controllers are derived to guarantee the exponential anti-synchronization of complex-valued memristor-based delayed neural networks.

When the topology is known, a reasonable approach to design is to select components among discrete alternatives for links and nodes to maximize reliability subject to cost. This problem is NP-hard with the added complication of a very computationally intensive objective function. This paper compares the performance of three classic metaheuristic procedures for solving large and realistic versions of the problem: hillclimbing, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Three alterations that use local search to seed the search or improve solutions during each iteration are also compared. It is shown that employing local search during evolution of the genetic algorithm, a memetic algorithm, yields the best network designs and does so at a reasonable computational cost. Hillclimbing performs well as a quick search for good designs, but cannot identify the most superior designs even when computational effort is equal to the metaheuristics.

These models can be executed under different simulation environments, and they can be easily integrated with models of other phenomena, described with different techniques.

As a special case of such systems, a networked switched control system (NSCS) is studied. This paper models NSCS with network-induced delay and packet dropout as switched delay systems. Sufficient conditions for robust exponential stability are given for a class of switching signals with average dwell time. A design method to stabilize a continuous-time, linear switched plant under a given communication network via a hybrid state feedback controller is proposed. The design of hybrid controllers is network-dependent and given in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LARs).																			1948-3449		978-1-4244-0817-7				2007							2523	2528																WOS:000257195302031

These applications and networks are subject to continuous change. The current separation of design process and operation in the field will be superseded by a life-long design process of adaptation, infield integration, and update. Continuous change and evolution, application interference, environment dynamics and uncertainty lead to complex effects which must be controlled to serve a growing set of platform and application needs. Self-adaptation based on self-awareness and self-configuration has been proposed as a basis for such a continuous in-field process. Research is needed to develop automated in-field design methods and tools with the required safety, availability, and security guarantees. The paper shows two complementary use cases of self-awareness in architectures, methods, and tools for cyber-physical systems. The first use case focuses on safety and availability guarantees in self-aware vehicle platforms. It combines contracting mechanisms, tool based self-analysis and self-configuration. A software architecture and a runtime environment executing these tools and mechanisms autonomously are presented including aspects of self-protection against failures and security threats. The second use case addresses variability and long term evolution in networked MPSoC integrating hardware and software mechanisms of surveillance, monitoring, and continuous adaptation. The approach resembles the logistics and operation principles of manufacturing plants which gave rise to the metaphoric term of an Information Processing Factory that relies on incremental changes and feedback control. Both use cases are investigated by larger research groups. Despite their different approaches, both use cases face similar design and design automation challenges which will be summarized in the end. We will argue that seemingly unrelated research challenges, such as in machine learning and security, could also profit from the methods and superior modeling capabilities of self-aware systems.

It is composed of eight double-pancake racetrack coils, each wound with 4-mm REBCO tapes manufactured by SuNAM Co., Inc. The Metal-as-Insulation technique will be used to reduce no-insulation charging delays. The gradient, uniformity and effective length of the initially-designed air-core quadruple magnet are 3.1 Tm-1, below 0.5%, and 209.0 mm, respectively. However, the magnet to be fabricated will be different from the designed magnet owing to manufacturing uncertainties. Therefore, magnetic field measurements must be performed in the volume of interest of the magnet. As it is impossible to measure the magnetic field at all points, it is crucial to obtain a mapping algorithm that can calculate the magnetic field in the volume of interest based on the measured field at several points. Herein, a mapping method using the discrete Fourier transform and artificial neural network interpolation was presented. To verify the mapping method, a mapping simulation of the designed magnet was performed and analyzed.

This knowledge can be obtained from experts or, nowadays more often, from machine learning processes applied to large volumes of data. However, for some of these learning processes, if the volume of data is large, the knowledge extraction phase is very slow (or even impossible). Moreover, often the origin of the data sets used for learning are measure processes in which the collected data can contain errors, so the presence of noise in the data is inevitable. It is in such environments where an initial step of noise filtering and reduction of data set size plays a fundamental role. For both tasks, instance selection emerges as a possible solution that has proved to be useful in various fields. In this paper we focus mainly on instance selection for noise removal. In addition, in contrast to most of the existing methods, which applied instance selection to classification tasks (discrete prediction), the proposed approach is used to obtain instance selection methods for regression tasks (prediction of continuous values). The different nature of the value to predict poses an extra difficulty that explains the low number of articles on the subject of instance selection for regression. More specifically the idea used in this article to adapt to regression problems "classic" instance-selection algorithms for classification is as simple as the discretization of the numerical output variable. In the experimentation, the proposed method is compared with much more sophisticated methods, specifically designed for regression, and shows to be very competitive. The main contributions of the paper include: (i) a simple way to adapt to regression instance selection algorithms for classification, (ii) the use of this approach to adapt a popular noise filter called ENN (edited nearest neighbor), and (iii) the comparison of this noise filter against two other specifically designed for regression, showing to be very competitive despite its simplicity.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for continuous historical top-k query processing in sensor networks, and our simulation results show that our schemes can reduce the total communication cost by up to two orders of magnitude, as compared with the centralized scheme or a straightforward extension from the previous top-k algorithm on a continuous monitoring query.

We made in-person visits to dispensaries, primary urban health centers (PUHCs), and polyclinics to collect operational information regarding service times, patient arrival rates, and medical resource capacities. We estimated probability distributions of the service times of healthcare providers using goodness-of-fit tests. We used a generic modeling approach to develop simulation models for each facility type and later integrated them into a network simulation. We evaluated operational metrics including average resource occupancies, average waiting time, and lengths-of-stay estimates in real-time across the network. We investigated how services would be provided to patients by varying capacities of resources experiencing bottlenecks in the network.

For an SPS that covers a wide area, one of the main concerns in the design of the system is the effect of communication conflicts and contention between devices on the total system operation. Contention causes work to be queued or blocked from execution and system performance may suffer as a result. In this paper, a discrete event simulation technique is used to study the communication performance of an SPS. The communication system of an SPS designed for relieving transient and dynamic instability is used for the study. The system modeling presented in this paper is aimed to verify whether the hardware design could accommodate the data traffic load and to avoid overpaying for network equipments. Through simulations the interactions among all devices and the bottlenecks of the communication system can be identified. Based on the simulation results, system designers could adopt available options to increase network bandwidth or hardware capability to maintain an adequate performance of the SPS.

By proposing a unified performance criterion, the work aims to integrate the designs of controller and compensator by connecting the latter and the performance index under the output feedback LQR setting. A new set of design equations for the controller and the compensator satisfying optimality conditions is derived which then is followed by a convergent algorithm that solves the design equations for the gains. Finally, a numerical example is given to compare performances and validate the proposed approach.

In this paper, we study how to achieve efficient broadcasting in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks with the assistance of location information. We accordingly design an efficient location based broadcasting algorithm. In the algorithm design, we do not assume any topological information. To reduce broadcast redundancy, our algorithm jointly uses distance based deferring and angle based deferring to encourage nodes with higher contributions to retransmit first. We further extend our algorithm for supporting continuous broadcast packet transmissions.

To handle the heterogeneity existing in the network, we first design adaptive event-based dynamic compensators for the agents. Distributed output feedback protocols, consisting of the dynamic compensators and the distributed state observers, the local controllers, and the triggering functions, are then designed to ensure that output consensus is achieved. Compared to the previous related works, our main contribution is that we design a fully distributed and scalable adaptive event-based protocol, whose design does not rely on any global information of the network graph and is independent of the network's scale. Continuous communications are not required for either control laws updating or triggering functions monitoring.

A delay-free transformation is developed based on a communication network which is a directed spanning tree, which can transform the original MAS to a new one without delays. By using this transformation, we design a static protocol for full-state coupling and a dynamic protocol for delayed state synchronization for homogeneous MAS via full- and partial-state coupling. Meanwhile, the delayed output synchronization is also studied for heterogeneous MAS, which is achieved by using a low-gain and output regulation based dynamic protocol design via the delay-free transformation.

The proposed mmCMD visualizes the micro-Doppler signatures of continuous motions generated from millimeter radar as images, which are then analyzed by an object detection network for continuous motion detection. To improve the imaging quality of micro-Doppler signatures, a dynamic feature visualization (DFV) method is proposed by selectively mapping the micro-Doppler matrix (MDM) elements with significant values, highlighting human motion to enhance subsequent detection network's accuracy in capturing the details of the motion. Furthermore, a novel detection network is designed for the visualized micro-Doppler images by combining the specially designed fusion squeeze-and-excitation (FSE) module with the coordinate attention (CA) into the YOLOv5 architecture, which is distinct from prior works that overlook global contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mmCMD achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 93% at the intersection over union (IoU) thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 and an F1 score of 99% for 12 actions, which makes it a promising solution for remotely monitoring and detecting elderly individuals' activities to enhance safety and risk prevention capabilities.																			1530-437X	1558-1748				FEB 1	2024	24	3					3394	3405		10.1109/JSEN.2023.3342103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2023.3342103													WOS:001249270000089

This study presents a multiscale dilated convolution and mixed-order attention-based deep neural network for monocular depth recovery. Specifically, we design a multilevel feature enhancement scheme to enhance and fuse high-resolution and low-resolution features on the basis of mixed-order attention. Moreover, a multiscale dilated convolution module that combines four different dilated convolutions is explored for deriving multi scale information and increasing the receptive field. Recent studies have shown that the design of loss terms is crucial to depth prediction. Therefore, an efficient loss function that combines the 1 pound loss, gradient loss, and classification loss is also designed to promote rich details. Experiments on three public datasets show that the presented approach achieves better performance than state-of-the-art depth prediction methods.

J	Hamzeei, M; Luedtke, J				Hamzeei, Mahdi; Luedtke, James			Service network design with equilibrium-driven demands	IISE TRANSACTIONS												We study a service network design problem in which the network operator wishes to determine facility locations and sizes in order to satisfy the demand of the customers while balancing the cost of the system with a measure of quality-of-service faced by the customers. We assume customers choose the facilities that meet demand, in order to minimize their total cost, including costs associated with traveling and waiting. When having demand served at a facility, customers face a service delay that depends on the total usage (congestion) of the facility. The total cost of meeting a customer's demand at a facility includes a facility-specific unit travel cost and a function of the service delay. When customers all minimize their own costs, the resulting distribution of customer demand to facilities is modeled as an equilibrium. This problem is motivated by several applications, including supplier selection in supply chain planning, preventive healthcare services planning, and shelter location-allocation in disaster management. We model the problem as a mixed-integer bilevel program that can be reformulated as a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program. The reformulated problem is difficult to solve by general-purpose solvers. Hence, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation approach that finds a candidate feasible solution along with a lower bound that can be used to validate the solution quality. The computational results indicate that the method can efficiently find feasible solutions, along with bounds on their optimality gap, even for large instances.																			2472-5854	2472-5862					2018	50	11					959	969		10.1080/24725854.2018.1479900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24725854.2018.1479900													WOS:000456884200003

A new numerical indicator, total mixing influence potential (TMIP), to reflect the influence of the stream mixing caused by performing a process on the total treatment flow rate of a distributed wastewater system is introduced. In design procedure, the TMIP value is calculated based on pinch principle. The process with the smallest TMIP value will be performed first. The results of a few literature examples show that designs with very low (even minimum) total treatment flow rates can be obtained with the method proposed. In addition, the method proposed is simple and of clear engineering insight.

Consensus-Based Cooperative Control Based on Pollution Sensing and Traffic Information for Urban Traffic Networks	SENSORS												Nowadays many studies are being conducted to develop solutions for improving the performance of urban traffic networks. One of the main challenges is the necessary cooperation among different entities such as vehicles or infrastructure systems and how to exploit the information available through networks of sensors deployed as infrastructures for smart cities. In this work an algorithm for cooperative control of urban subsystems is proposed to provide a solution for mobility problems in cities. The interconnected traffic lights controller (TLC) network adapts traffic lights cycles, based on traffic and air pollution sensory information, in order to improve the performance of urban traffic networks. The presence of air pollution in cities is not only caused by road traffic but there are other pollution sources that contribute to increase or decrease the pollution level. Due to the distributed and heterogeneous nature of the different components involved, a system of systems engineering approach is applied to design a consensus-based control algorithm. The designed control strategy contains a consensus-based component that uses the information shared in the network for reaching a consensus in the state of TLC network components. Discrete event systems specification is applied for modelling and simulation. The proposed solution is assessed by simulation studies with very promising results to deal with simultaneous responses to both pollution levels and traffic flows in urban traffic networks.

Optimization of Sewer Networks Using an Adaptive Genetic Algorithm	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												This work aims at introducing an optimization model to design sewer networks. The approach specially focuses on handling the nonlinear and discrete constraints of the problem. For this purpose, an adaptive genetic algorithm is developed so that every chromosome, consisting of sewer diameters and slopes and pump indicators, is a feasible design. The binary chromosomes are freely generated and then decoded to feasible design alternatives following a sequential design-analysis algorithm. The adaptive decoding strategy is set up based on the open channel hydraulics and sewer design criteria. Through the proposed method, all the sewer system's constraints are systematically satisfied. Consequently, there is neither need to discard or repair infeasible chromosomes nor to apply penalty factors to the cost function. A benchmark sewer network from the literature is considered to be designed using the proposed approach. The obtained results are then discussed and compared with the previous works. It is found that the adaptive constraint handling method computationally makes the optimization more efficient in terms of speed and reliability.

How to efficiently fuse speech and facial information for inferring the affective state of a person from data captured in real-world conditions is a very important issue for continuous affect recognition. Currently, late fusion is usually used in multi-modal continuous affect recognition to improve system performance. However, late fusion ignores the complementarity and redundancy between multiple streams from the different modalities. In this work, we propose an efficient model-level fusion approach for audiovisual continuous affect recognition. First, we propose a LSTM based model-level fusion approach for audiovisual continuous affect recognition. Our approach considers the complementarity and redundancy between multiple streams from different modalities. In addition, our model can efficiently incorporate side information such as gender using adaptive weight network. At last, we design a deep supervision based effective optimization strategy for training the proposed audiovisual continuous affect recognition model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the RECOLA dataset. Our experimental results show that the proposed adaptive weight network improves the performance compared to a plain neural network without adaptive weights. Our approach obtains remarkable improvements on both arousal and valence in terms of concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) compared to state-of-the-art early fusion and model-level fusion approaches. Therefore, we believe that our proposed approach gives a promising direction for further improving the performance of audiovisual continuous affect recognition. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome the difficulty in the derivation of the optimal control protocols for these systems, we develop an observer-based adaptive synchronization control approach, including the designs of a distributed observer and a distributed model reference adaptive controller with no prior knowledge of all agents' dynamics. To begin with, for the purpose of estimating the state of a nonlinear active leader for each follower, an adaptive neural network distributed observer is designed. Such an observer serves as a reference model in the distributed model reference adaptive control (MRAC). Then, a reinforcement learning-based distributed MRAC algorithm is presented to make every follower track its corresponding reference model on behavior in real time. In this algorithm, a distributed actor-critic network is employed to approximate the optimal distributed control protocols and the cost function. Through convergence analysis, the overall observer estimation error, the model reference tracking error, and the weight estimation errors are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The developed approach further achieves the synchronization by means of synthesizing these results. The effectiveness of the developed approach is verified through a numerical example.					chen, xin/AFS-7186-2022	Chen, Xin/0000-0001-9924-6833; Wu, Min/0000-0002-0668-8315													2162-237X	2162-2388				FEB	2022	33	2					681	693		10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3028569	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3028569								33079683					WOS:000752016400021

The immaturity of AMS layout automation tools comes to a large extent from the difficulty in comprehending and incorporating designer expertise. To mimic the behavior of experienced designers in well generation, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) guided well generation framework with a post-refinement stage leveraging the previous high-quality manually-crafted layouts. Guiding regions for wells are first created by a trained GAN model, after which the well generation results are legalized through post-refinement to satisfy design rules. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is able to generate wells close to manual designs with comparable post-layout circuit performance.

However, the cooperative game issues of discrete-time multiplayer systems with control constraints have rarely been investigated in this field. In order to address this issue, a novel policy iteration (PI) algorithm is proposed based on ADP technique, and its associated convergence analysis is also studied in this brief paper. For the proposed PI algorithm, an online neural network (NN) implementation scheme with multiple-network structure is presented. In the online NN-based learning algorithm, critic network, constrained actor networks and unconstrained actor networks are employed to approximate the value function, constrained and unconstrained control policies, respectively, and the NN weight updating laws are designed based on the gradient descent method. Finally, a numerical simulation example is illustrated to show the effectiveness. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Such a neural network is designed based on a matrix-valued error function instead of a scalar-valued norm-based error function. In this paper, we develop and investigate a discrete-time model of Zhang neural network (termed as such and abbreviated to ZNN for presentation convenience), which is depicted by a system of difference equations. Compared with Newton iteration for matrix inversion, we find that the discrete-time ZNN model incorporates Newton iteration as one of its special cases. Noticing this relation, we perform numerical comparisons on different situations of using Zhang neural network and Newton iteration for the matrix inversion. Different kinds of activation functions and different step-size values are examined as well for the superior convergence and better stability of ZNN model. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of both ZNN model and Newton iteration for constant matrix inversion.																					978-1-4244-1705-6				2008							1432	1437																WOS:000262125901025
C	Enfield, KE; Siekas, JJ; Pence, DV		Kandlikar, SG		Enfield, KE; Siekas, JJ; Pence, DV			Laminate mixing in micro-scale fractal-like merging channel networks	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MICROCHANNELS AND MINICHANNELS					1st International Conference on Microchannels and Minichannels	APR 24-25, 2003	Rochester, NY	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Rochester Inst Technol				A two-dimensional model was developed to predict concentration profiles resulting from passive, or diffusive, mixing of laminated layers formed in a fractal-like merging flow network. Both uniform and parabolic velocity profiles were considered in the model. Concentration profiles were experimentally acquired near the top surface of the flow network using laser induced fluorescence. The degree of mixing was assessed from concentration profiles at the end of each channel. Although the degree of mixing from the two-dimensional model well predicts the trend of the experimental degree of mixing, the numerical model under predicts the experimental values by approximately 25 percent. This may be due in part to the presence of top and bottom walls in the experimental device. These walls tend to slow the flow in this region, thereby increasing the residence time and improving the mixing. These top and bottom walls are neglected in the two-dimensional model. For the existing flow network, the degree of mixing is provided as a function of Peclet number. The degree of mixing is further investigated by varying the number of branching levels, the width of the initial flow channels, and the total flow length for a fixed Peclet number. A nondimensional parameter is established that serves as a design tool for predicting an optimum number of branching levels for fixed values of the total flow length, initial branch width and channel depth.																					0-7918-3667-3				2003							859	867		10.1115/ICMM2003-1114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/ICMM2003-1114													WOS:000222636600107

Designing and applying effective wireless sensor network-based structural health monitoring systems for large-scale civil infrastructure require a great number of wireless sensors and the optimal wireless sensor networks configuration becomes critical for such spatially separated large structures. In this article, optimal wireless sensor network configuration for structural health monitoring is treated as a discrete optimization problem, where parameter identification and network performance are simultaneously addressed. To solve this rather complicated optimization problem, a novel swarm intelligence algorithm called the automatic-learning firefly algorithm is proposed by integrating the original firefly algorithm with the Levy flight and the automatic-learning mechanism. In the proposed algorithm, the Levy flight is adopted to maximize the searching capability in unknown solution space and avoid premature convergence and the automatic-learning mechanism is designed to drive fireflies to move toward better locations at high speed. Numerical experiments are performed on a long-span bridge to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed automatic-learning firefly algorithm. Results indicate that automatic-learning firefly algorithm can find satisfactory wireless sensor network configurations, which facilitate easy discrimination of identified mode vectors and long wireless sensor network lifetime, and the innovations in automatic-learning firefly algorithm make it superior to the simple discrete firefly algorithm as to solution quality and convergence speed.																			1369-4332	2048-4011				MAR	2019	22	4			SI		907	918		10.1177/1369433218797074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1369433218797074													WOS:000459579700006

Moreover, incorporating aspects of reliability into the modeling of facility location problems is an effective way to hedge against disruptions in the system. In this paper, we consider a combined facility location/network design problem that considers system reliability. This problem has a number of applications, many of which fall into the category of service systems, such as regional planning and locating schools, health care service centers and airline networks. Our model also includes an investment budget constraint. We propose a mixed integer programming formulation to model this problem, as well as an efficient heuristic based on the problem's LP relaxation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic significantly outperforms CPLEX in terms of solution speed, while still maintaining excellent solution quality. Our results also suggest a favorable tradeoff between the "nominal cost" (including fixed facility location costs and link construction costs, as well as transportation costs) and system reliability; that is, substantial improvements in reliability are often possible with only slight increases in the total cost of investment and transportation.					jabalameli, mohammad saeed/S-8820-2018; Shishebori, Davood/AAR-9394-2020	Shishebori, Davood/0000-0001-7737-6565													1566-113X	1572-9427				DEC	2014	14	3-4					549	580		10.1007/s11067-014-9254-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11067-014-9254-6													WOS:000345972100012

Controller synthesis for networked control systems	AUTOMATICA												This paper presents a discrete-time model for networked control systems (NCSs) that incorporates all network phenomena: time-varying sampling intervals, packet dropouts and time-varying delays that may be both smaller and larger than the sampling interval. Based on this model, constructive LMI conditions for controller synthesis are derived, such that stabilizing state-feedback controllers can be designed. Besides the proposed controller synthesis conditions a comparison is made between the use of parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions for stability analysis. Several examples illustrate the effectiveness of the developed theory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we present a practical design for the control-theoretic approach for Quality of Service (QoS) control in network routers. To achieve both robustness and efficiency, we adopted a discrete time domain form of PID control algorithm as a primary control scheme for the Control-Theoretic QoS Router (CTQR) system. The proposed system can operate independent of internal states of routing. This approach simplifies the design of the control system and guarantees the intended output performance. We have implemented a protorype system using Linux, and measured the performance under various network QoS constraints. As expected, the prototype CTQR system was able to provide QoS control without too much overhead.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	3-540-22262-6				2004	3079						74	83																WOS:000222523700007

In recent years, several advances have been reported in methodologies for the design of mass exchange networks (MENs), using approaches as the pinch point and mathematical programming. Recently, simultaneous design and optimization methodologies have been proposed. The design methods based on simultaneous optimization offer the possibility of synthetizing MENs in a single step, formulating the synthesis problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). In this work, a MINLP model for the synthesis of mass exchange networks is presented. The model is based on a superstructure represented with disjunctions. The proposed superstructure is obtained from a state-task-network representation and is applied to a process for copper removal from an etching process. The obtained mass exchange network showed a lower total annual cost than the networks previously reported for the same process. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the autonomous CVS are derived without a cyber-attack. Then, a virtual system in hidden layer, interconnected with the original CVS in platoon layer through the designed interaction network, is introduced to resist cyber attacks. Matrix analysis tool, algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov stability method are used to analyze the convergence of CVS. It is proved that the states of CVS can reach consensus and the state errors converge to a certain bound in the case of attacks existing only in hidden layer, or in the overall system including both hidden layer and platoon layer.

However, in case that all the decomposed small functional blocks has already certified in timing waveforms, an event-based methodology can provide the designer with macroscopic abstraction of the functional verification. This paper presents a methodology which is applicable to an event-based pre-analysis of a VHDL-implemented hardware model. The methodology can provide the designer with an event level convenience as a functional verification means. The designer can not only save design time and cost but also easily establish rest scenarios in a discrete event level by programming instead of making complex and tedious test vectors. This paper also describes a practical use of this methodology in developing a customized A TM network interface controller chip.																					1-56555-125-7				1997							634	638																WOS:000088776300109

Given is such a network with active and passive components, that is, valves, compressors, control valves (active) and pipelines (passive), and a desired amount of flow at certain specified entry and exit nodes in the network. The active elements are associated with costs when used. Besides flow conservation constraints in the nodes, the flow must fulfill nonlinear nonconvex pressure loss constraints on the arcs subject to potential values (i.e., pressure levels) in both end nodes of each arc. The problem is to compute a cost minimal setting of the active components and numerical values for the flow and node potentials. We examine different (convex) relaxations for a subproblem of the design problem and benefit from them within a branch-and-bound approach. We compare different approaches based on nonlinear optimization numerically on a set of test instances.

The T-S fuzzy model is employed to approximate the nonlinear uncertain networked control system. The dynamic output feedback controller is constructed based on the T-S fuzzy model and descriptor redundancy approach. The nonquadratic stability conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived by introducing the descriptor redundancy approach and nonquadratic fuzzy Lyapunov functional, such that the solutions of the closed-loop system converge to an adjustable bounded region. Then, the control design conditions are relaxed and design flexibility is enhanced. By introducing the descriptor redundancy approach and nonquadratic fuzzy Lyapunov functional, the numerous crossing terms in the LMIs are avoided in the control system design.

In the communication channel, the output measurement are quantised before transmission, and two kinds of network-induced delays are taken into account simultaneously: (i) random delay from sensor to controller and (ii) random delay from controller to actuator. These two types of random delays are modelled as two independent Bernoulli distributed white sequences. The observer-based controller is synthesised to stabilise the networked closed-loop system in the sense of stochastic stability. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the controller are provided by stochastic Lyapunov method.

And some new stability conditions of the DHNNs are obtained by studying the stability of small ones. Those results provide the guided significance for designing a DHNNs and afford benefit for stability analysis of DHNNs.

Many examples have shown that achieving high validation accuracies require a very large number of parameters in most cases and therefore, the space used to store these models becomes very large. This may be a disadvantage on small storage size and low performance CPU edge devices during image processing that are embedded with neural networks for object recognition tasks. In this paper, we investigate the effect of input images which are partially compressed using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) algorithm on two different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) performances, known as CNN-C (large model) and CNN-RC3 (small model). DCT is used to reduce some data redundancies but also the risk of losing valuable features for the network to learn efficiently. However, the results show that both CNN architectures with DCT features perform as well as with raw image data, concluding that a properly designed CNN model can still achieve high performance on further compressed images regardless of its information reductions.

Dynamic Event-Triggered State Estimation for Discrete-Time Singularly Perturbed Systems With Distributed Time-Delays	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS												This paper is concerned with the state estimation problem for a class of discrete-time singularly perturbed systems with distributed time-delays. During the data transmission through a network channel of limited bandwidth, for the sake of collision avoidance and energy saving, a dynamic event-triggered scheme is employed to schedule the data communication from the sensors to the designed estimator. First, for a given singular perturbation parameter (SPP), by constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii SPP-dependent functional, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the exponentially mean-square ultimate boundedness of the error dynamics of the state estimation. Furthermore, in the case that the SPP does not exceed a predefined upper bound, a design algorithm is developed for the desired state estimator ensuring that the error dynamics is exponentially mean-square ultimately bounded. In this case, by solving certain matrix inequalities, the estimator gain is characterized without needing to know the exact SPP (as long as it stays below the given upper bound). Moreover, the ultimate bound of the error dynamics is estimated. Finally, simulation results are given to confirm the validity and advantages of the proposed design scheme of the state estimator.

We investigate multi-input-multi-output unknown nonaffine nonlinear DT systems and employ two neural networks (NNs).

On the other hand, a critic NN is applied to estimate the cost function, which satisfies the recursive equations derived from heuristic dynamic programming. The weights of both the action NN and the critic NN are directly updated online instead of offline training. By utilizing Lyapunov's direct method, the closed-loop tracking errors and the NN estimated weights are demonstrated to be uniformly ultimately bounded.

A new bounding technique is proposed to estimate some finite-sum terms appearing in the forward difference of the chosen Lyapunov functional. This new bounding technique can provide tighter upper bounds for some finite-sum terms and avoid overly bounding for the finite-sum terms. Then a novel delay-dependent stability criterion is derived by using this new bounding technique. Compared with some existing stability criteria in the published literature, the novel stability criterion is proven theoretically to be less conservative and is shown to be of smaller numerical complexity.

Meanwhile, the transportation system will be in a mixed stage of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) for a long time. The study of communication capacity and strategies for mixed traffic systems is of great significance for the popularization of CAVs and the deployment of communication infrastructures. However, current research mainly focuses on the communication capacity analysis in the scenario with full penetration of CAVs, while the influence caused by HDVs on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and the capacity analysis of connected vehicles in mixed traffic systems need further understanding. To address this issue, this article considers the shadow fading caused by HDVs on wireless communication links and analyzes the communication capacity in mixed traffic systems. Specifically, we first synthesize the V2V and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication modes to propose an analytical framework for vehicular network communication capacity in mixed traffic. Then, a predictive communication strategy is also provided that caches the required content at infrastructure in advance according to predicted vehicle trajectories to improve the capacity of vehicular networks in mixed traffic. Furthermore, the derived capacity analysis theorems reveal the communication capacity of mixed traffic is closely related to the CAV penetration rate, the vehicle arrival rate, and the infrastructure deployment interval. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and the proposed predictive communication strategy can increase the mixed traffic communication capacity compared to existing communication strategies. The theoretical results herein can guide the implementation of vehicular network applications and the design of communication strategies in mixed traffic systems.

The consensus control is designed based on the event-triggered communication scheme, which can lead to a significant reduction of the information communication burden in the multi-agent network. Meanwhile, only the communication between the agent and its local neighbors is needed, therefore, the designed control is essentially distributed.

The foremost control objective is set to design a highly reliable and advanced control strategy to ensure the utmost accuracy in the control effort. A modified artificial neural network (ANN)-based modelling and pace tracking using finite dimension repetitive controller (FDRC) design based on internal model principle (IMP) has been presented here. This controller will not only provide accurate tracking but also minimize the control action time due to less amount of data handling through the deployment of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in the loop of repetitive controller (RC). Finally, a case study has been propounded considering ANN model using available data sets and software to validate the control strategy and justify the control objective for optimizing the pace tracking in a pacemaker. Result of the experiment showed good accuracy as well as very low error in terms of mean-squared error (MSE), integral absolute error (IAE), integral time absolute error (ITAE) and integral time square error (ITSE). Along with that, it is observed that DWT not only benefits the handling of very less memory but also acts as an additional filter while reconstructing the signal, which serves as an added advantage of this model.

Firstly, a detailed task analysis served as the basis for the task network modeling. Then, the attentional attributes were assigned to different area of interests (AOIs) for each task unit through lowest ordinal algorithm. Finally, a stochastic dynamic simulation model was applied to compute the dynamic distribution of attention resource with the workflow. Twenty-four participants flew a simulation task in a high-fidelity Boeing 737-800 flight simulator to verify the model.

Convergence property is developed to guarantee that the iterative performance index function will converge to the optimum.

H-infinity, fault-tolerant controller for a new networked control system with time-varying actuator faults occurring is designed in this paper. Based on the network transmission environment, the networked control system is firstly modeled as a closed loop discrete time system with time varying actuator faults and outside disturbance considered. And the time varying property of actuator faults is reflected by a time-varying parameter. Moreover, using Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, the H-infinity, fault-tolerant controller is proposed to guarantee such faulty networked control system asymptotically stable.

To deal with the asymmetric input saturation, a unified smooth nonlinear function is constructed to effectively characterize the limitations between the control signal and the actuator. Subsequently, the novel back-stepping design process, instead of the traditional n-step-ahead predictor, is developed to design the stable event-triggered adaptive tracking controller by combining one neural approximator. Especially, a modified event-triggering condition is equipped into the designed controller to increase the number of triggering events at the transient-state stage. The proposed control scheme can not only achieve the good tracking performance with the avoidance of the n-step time delays and the improvement of the transient-state performance but also alleviate the transmission burden of the network resource, and eliminate the effect of the asymmetric actuator saturation. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme proposed in this article.

J	Elhedhli, S; Wu, HY				Elhedhli, Samir; Wu, Huyu			A Lagrangean Heuristic for Hub-and-Spoke System Design with Capacity Selection and Congestion	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING												Hub-and-spoke networks are widely applied in a variety of industries such as transportation, postal delivery, and telecommunications. Although they are designed to exploit economies of scale, hub-and-spoke networks are known to favour congestion, jeopardizing the performance of the entire system. This paper looks at incorporating congestion and capacity decisions in the design stage of such networks. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer program (NMIP) that explicitly minimizes congestion, capacity acquisition, and transportation costs. Congestion at hubs is modeled as the ratio of total flow to surplus capacity by viewing the hub-and-spoke system as a network of M/M/1 queues. To solve the NMIP, we propose a Lagrangean heuristic where the problem is decomposed into an easy subproblem and a more difficult nonlinear subproblem. The nonlinear subproblem is first linearized using piecewise functions and then solved to optimality using a cutting plane method. The Lagrangean lower bound is found using subgradient optimization. The solution from the subproblems is used to find a heuristic solution. Computational results indicate the efficiency of the methodology in providing a sharp bound and in generating high-quality feasible solutions in most cases.																			1091-9856	1526-5528				SPR	2010	22	2					282	296		10.1287/ijoc.1090.0335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0335													WOS:000277285900009

Delays limit mobile coverage. Therefore, optimisation techniques and tools are applied to minimise delays. However, there is still a high chance that at some points the network will lose its integral connectivity and delays happen. Delays prohibit call transmissions and produce several breaks. System breaks/delays cause call pending for a connection. Accordingly, network partitioning happens, thus leads to disconnection. This paper proposes a mixed-integer programming (MIP) to minimise network delays while a reliable trade-off between registration signalling (RS) and paging (P) coverage distances is maintained. The proposed MIP is NP-hard. For this reason, a metaheuristic approach, genetic algorithm (GA), is developed and compared with it. MIP validation is endorsed by GA approximations in different random trials and comparative analysis investigates GA performance metrics in a numerical example.																			1754-3916	1754-3924					2021	26	4					367	397																WOS:000662984600001

Stochastic jumps, well-suited to account for unpredictable events like faults or abrupt changes in the parameters, are modeled by means of a Markov chain. The deterministic switches are dictated by a scheduling signal, used as a control variable in order to achieve stochastic stability and guaranteed input/output performance. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a state-feedback switching law attaining these goals. Further, the more challenging co-design problem is addressed, namely the joint synthesis of a linear state-feedback controller and a stabilizing switching strategy ensuring a prescribed performance. The results are illustrated by means of a numerical example concerning a networked control system under occasional communication failures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The distributed ST codes are designed to operate in wireless networks containing a large set of nodes N, of which only a small a priori unknown subset S C N will be active at any time. Under the proposed scheme, a relay node transmits a signal which is the product of a diagonal block-based ST code (optimized specifically for ST-CPM transmission) and a signature vector of length N. uniquely assigned to each node in the network. An efficient method is presented for the design and optimization of appropriate signature vector sets, assuming a quasi-static, frequency nonselective fading channel model. If a properly designed signature vector set is employed it is shown that a diversity order of d = min{N-S, N-c} an be achieved, where NS is the number of active relay nodes. The decoding complexity of the proposed scheme is shown to be independent of the number of active relay nodes, and non-coherent receiver implementations, which do not require channel estimation, are applicable. Compared to distributed ST transmission with linear modulation, distributed ST-CPM can considerably reduce the energy consumption at the transmitter due to the constant envelope of the transmit signal. At the same time, the additional energy consumption due to more complex receiver processing can be kept low. Therefore, the proposed distributed ST-CPM scheme is particularly apt for energy-efficient cooperative transmission in wireless networks.

For the active leader in a general linear form, we give a distributed design for each discrete-time agent in the leader tracking control problem and analyze the tracking convergence with the help of Riccati equation and common Lyapunov function when the communication channel is perfect. Then a stochastic quantization strategy is applied to model the information transmission in the agent coordination and the corresponding solution is also given, even if the interconnection topology is switching.					hu, jiangping/G-6897-2011; Feng, gang/B-5232-2013	hu, jiangping/0000-0002-7559-8604; Feng, gang/0000-0001-8508-8416													2161-2927		978-7-89463-104-6				2010							4560	4565																WOS:000397331304127

Attention mechanism has been widely used in computer vision, inspired by this, we have designed a joint attention network for spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral image. In our method, recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention can learn inner spectral correlations within a continuous spectrum, convolutional neural network (CNN) with attention is designed to focus on saliency features and spatial dependency in the neighbor regions.

In this paper, we have extended obTCP for terrestrial-satellite hybrid networks and compared its uploading performances with that of seamless IP diversity based NEMO (SINEMO), which is a potential candidate for these networks. In terrestrial-satellite environment, the challenge lies in designing appropriate protocol functionalities for three dissimilar wireless hops (Mobile Host. Mobile Router. Satellite. Ground Station) in cascade. We have first described the modified protocol, then developed an analytical model to characterize its performance, and finally validated the performance model through discrete event simulation. Our analysis shows that obTCP (running on top of NEMO BSP) outperforms SINEMO, as long as BER is less than 10(-4), in terms of both end-to-end delay and throughput.					; Saha, Debashis/C-1145-2015	Ghosh, Shankar kumar/0000-0003-2178-4775; Saha, Debashis/0000-0003-0523-9646													2165-0209		978-1-4799-4272-5				2014							146	151		10.1109/EAIT.2014.21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EAIT.2014.21													WOS:000380436200024

How-ever, existing CNN-based SISR network structure design consider mostly only channel or spatial information, and cannot make full use of both channel and spa-tial information to improve SISR performance further. The present work addresses this problem by proposing a mixed attention densely residual network architecture that can make full and simultaneous use of both channel and spatial information. Specifically, we propose a residual in dense network structure composed of dense connections between multiple dense residual groups to form a very deep network. This structure allows each dense residual group to apply a local residual skip con-nection and enables the cascading of multiple residual blocks to reuse previous features. A mixed attention module is inserted into each dense residual group, to enable the algorithm to fuse channel attention with laplacian spatial attention effectively, and thereby more adaptively focus on valuable feature learning. The qualitative and quantitative results of extensive experiments have demon-strate that the proposed method has a comparable performance with other state-of-the-art methods.

The Macquarie Island (LoFlo2G) high-precision continuous atmospheric carbon dioxide record	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												The Southern Ocean (south of 30 degrees S) is a key global-scale sink of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the isolated and inhospitable nature of this environment has restricted the number of oceanic and atmospheric CO2 measurements in this region. This has limited the scientific community's ability to investigate trends and seasonal variability of the sink. Compared to regions further north, the near-absence of terrestrial CO2 exchange and strong large-scale zonal mixing demands unusual inter-site measurement precision to help distinguish the presence of midlatitude to high latitude ocean exchange from large CO2 fluxes transported southwards in the atmosphere. Here we describe a continuous, in situ, ultra-high-precision Southern Ocean region CO2 record, which ran at Macquarie Island (54 degrees 37'S, 158 degrees 52'E) from 2005 to 2016 using a LoFlo2 instrument, along with its calibration strategy, uncertainty analysis and baseline filtering procedures. Uncertainty estimates calculated for minute and hourly frequency data range from 0.01 to 0.05 mu mol mol(-1) depending on the averaging period and application. Higher precisions are applicable when comparing Macquarie Island LoFlo measurements to those of similar instruments on the same internal laboratory calibration scale and more uncertain values are applicable when comparing to other networks. Baseline selection is designed to remove measurements that are influenced by local Macquarie Island CO2 sources, with effective removal achieved using a within-minute CO2 standard deviation metric. Additionally, measurements that are influenced by CO2 fluxes from Australia or other Southern Hemisphere land masses are effectively removed using model-simulated radon concentration. A comparison with flask records of atmospheric CO2 at Macquarie Island highlights the limitation of the flask record (due to corrections for storage time and limited temporal coverage) when compared to the new high-precision, continuous record: the new record shows much less noisy seasonal variations than the flask record. As such, this new record is ideal for improving our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the Southern Ocean CO2 flux, particularly when combined with data from similar instruments at other Southern Hemispheric locations.

The system is based on a mixed signal approach considering the digital nature of the peripheral and control logics and the integration being analog. So, the system is connected digitally outside but the core is purely analog. This mixed signal approach provides the advantage of implementing neural networks with spiking events in a synchronous way. Moreover, the use of nano-sclae memristive device saves the area and power of the system and some considerations about the the device have also been proposed in the paper to make the system more energy efficient.

J	Tien, PL				Tien, Po-Lung			A New Discrete-Time Multi-Constrained <i>K</i>-Winner-Take-All Recurrent Network and Its Application to Prioritized Scheduling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												In this paper, we propose a novel discrete-time recurrent neural network aiming to resolve a new class of multi-constrained K-winner-take-all (K-WTA) problems. By facilitating specially designed asymmetric neuron weights, the proposed model is capable of operating in a fully parallel manner, thereby allowing true digital implementation. This paper also provides theorems that delineate the theoretical upper bound of the convergence latency, which is merely O(K). Importantly, via simulations, the average convergence time is close to O(1) in most general cases. Moreover, as the multi-constrained K-WTA problem degenerates to a traditional single-constrained problem, the upper bound becomes exactly two parallel iterations, which significantly outperforms the existing K-WTA models. By associating the neurons and neuron weights with routing paths and path priorities, respectively, we then apply the model to a prioritized flow scheduler for the data center networks. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheduler converges to the equilibrium state within near-constant time for different scales of networks while achieving maximal throughput, quality-of-service priority differentiation, and minimum energy consumption, subject to the flow contention-free constraints.																			2162-237X	2162-2388				NOV	2017	28	11					2674	2685		10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2600410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2600410								28113608					WOS:000413403900018

The MTC networks will be deployed by using low-power transceivers with finite discrete configurations. This paper considers minimum length scheduling problem for full-duplex WPCNs, where users transmit information to a hybrid access point at a rate chosen from a finite set of discrete-rate levels. The optimization problem considers energy causality, data and maximum transmit power constraints, and is proven to be NP-hard. As a solution strategy, we define the minimum length scheduling (MLS) slot, which is slot of minimum transmission completion time while starting transmission at anytime after the decision time. We solve the problem optimally for a given transmission order based on the optimality analysis of MLS slot. For the general problem, we categorize the problem based on whether the MLS slots of users overlap over time. We propose optimal algorithm for non-overlapping scenario by allocating the MLS slots, and a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for overlapping scenario by allocating the transmission slot to the user with earliest MLS slot. Through simulations, we demonstrate significant gains of scheduling and discrete rate allocation.

Further, at the same time as also suggesting that natural evolution may provide inspiration for search mechanisms to design machines, he noted that mechanisms inspired by the social aspects of learning may prove useful. This paper presents results from an investigation into using Turing's dynamical representation designed by Evolutionary Programming and a new imitation-based, i. e., cultural, approach.

Via the fact that single loop feedback control shows a shortcoming in that the plant output as nonzero disturbance acts on the systems, a new model of singular networked cascade control system is proposed. In this system, both the network-induced delay and data packed dropout phenomena are considered. Based on the model, sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities and the corresponding H-infinity stabilizing controller design technique is also developed based on the above conditions. The proposed method emphasizes the implementation issue and employs the cascade control to singular networked control systems.

Traditionally, planning the channel route network has been a manual process, requiring numerous hours to generate a monthly channel route schedule. We formulate the monthly channel route scheduling problem using a traditional network design formulation, and we use price-directive decomposition to overcome tractability issues. The resulting linear programming bounds on the optimal integer solution are weak. To overcome these challenges, we apply a variable redefinition technique known as composite variable modelling. Using this technique, we alleviate the need to explicitly include cargo flow decisions by implicitly capturing them in the design variables. The resulting formulation is computationally superior to the traditional network design formulation because it achieves tighter bounds, allowing excellent integer solutions to be found quickly.

The model presented here explicitly incorporates user equilibrium constraints and takes the form of a difficult nonlinear, nonconvex mathematical program. The user equilibrium constraints form a finite set of nonlinear, albeit nonconvex, inequalities, and give rise to a single level mathematical program, as opposed to the now standard mathematical programming/variational inequality representation which leads to a bilevel formulation of the equilibrium network design problem. We show that simulated annealing is ideally suited for solving multiobjective versions of the equilibrium network design problem articulated in this fashion. We employ the 'weighting' method together with simulated annealing to generate the Pareto optimal set. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of this solution methodology.

It is assumed that the random sensor-filter delay satisfies Markovian characteristics, but the transition probabilities of the delay transferring from one value to others are partly known. A novel measurement model is proposed to reflect the random delay of the transmission modes and the resulting filtering error system is modeled as a Markovian jump system (MJS) with multiple modes and state delay. Sufficient conditions are derived for the filtering error system to be stochastically stable and ensure a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level bound by using mode-dependent Lyapunov functional approach. Based on the derived conditions, a design procedure for the H-infinity filter is also presented. A numerical example is provided to show the design process of the filter and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the analysis and design of such discrete control systems have not been established, because those systems have severe nonlinear characteristics and do not respond continuously in time. In this paper, the stability of discrete event control systems is studied based on multiple metrics and simultaneous inequalities. Especially, in this paper, the structures of discrete event types of systems are analyzed using connection matrices (i.e., permutation (0,1)-matrices). The relationship between connection matrices and graph representations is also reviewed in general. A stability condition is derived based on the concept of nonnegative inverse matrices (so-called M-matrices). Numerical examples were shown to clarify the stability and boundedness of discrete-event control systems.																			2072-5639		978-4-88898-300-6				2019							955	960																WOS:000490720700166

Recursive fusion estimation for stochastic discrete time-varying complex networks under stochastic communication protocol: The state-saturated case	INFORMATION FUSION												In this paper, we investigate the recursive fusion estimation problem for time-varying state-saturated complex networks under stochastic communication protocol (SCP). To cater for physical limitations of network components, the phenomenon of state saturations is taken into account in the complex network model. The underlying communication mechanism is to ensure that just one sensor node is permitted to send its collected measurement at each time, and the SCP determines the permission to use the network channel for each sensor at each transmission time. A key issue of the addressed problem is to construct a time-varying state estimator such that an upper bound is guaranteed on the filtering error covariance subjected to both the state saturations and the SCP. By applying two sets of matrix difference equations, we first derive an upper bound according to the error covariance of the state estimation and then minimize such an upper bound by precisely calculating the estimator parameters. Then, the performance analysis of the obtained state estimator is given in terms of the boundedness. Finally, we provide a simulation example to illustrate the validity of the designed state estimator.

The approach is used to reduce the peak temperature by eliminating local hotspots. In proposed thermal-aware synthesis, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) based meta-heuristic search algorithm is used to select a suitable input polarity of Mixed Polarity Dual Reed-Muller Expansion (MPDRM) to reduce the power and power-density by optimizing the area sharing. A parallel tabular technique is used for input polarity conversion from Product-of-Sum (POS) to MPDRM function. Finally, the optimized solutions are implemented in the physical design level to obtain the actual values of area, power, and temperature.

To handle the all-around attacks, a constrained hybrid attacks model is established, which incorporates the pattern feature of false data injection attacks and physical attacks. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory and the linear matrix inequality technique, a novel dynamic event-triggering pinning synchronization control scheme is developed to cope with the synchronization control task.

The mixed-domain circuit representation is based on Kirchhoffian network theory. Micromechanical and electromechanical components may be partitioned hierarchically into low-level reusable elements. The MEMS component-level synthesis approach uses optimization to generate microstructure layout that meets specified performance criteria. A feature-recognition based extractor for verification translates layout geometry into the mixed-domain circuit representation. A common MEMS component, the integrated microresonator, demonstrates the use of these tools. Lumped-parameter MEMS simulation of the resonant frequency matches finite-element analysis to 1% and fabricated resonators match to within 4% of the synthesized performance.

For the classical-quantum case (CQ MAC), achievable rates are known assuming that all the messages are decoded, a common assumption in quantum network design. However, such a conventional design approach ignores the global network structure, i.e., the network topology. When a CQ MAC is given as a part of quantum network communication, this work shows that computation properties can be used to boost communication speeds with code design dependent on the network topology. We quantify achievable quantum communication rates of codes with the computation property for a two-sender CQ MAC. When the two-sender CQ MAC is a boson coherent channel with binary discrete modulation, we show that it achieves the maximum possible communication rate (the single-user capacity), which cannot be achieved with conventional design. Further, such a rate can be achieved by different detection methods: quantum (with and without quantum memory), on-off photon counting, and homodyne (each at different photon power). Finally, we describe two practical applications, one of which cryptographic.

In depth studies of these large and complex networks that are still in their nascent stages cannot be effectively performed using analytical methods. Hence, discrete event simulation techniques are the only viable means to study and analyze active networking architectures. Furthermore, customized and flexible tools are required to for the analysis of active networks using simulation. This paper describes an integrated environment for the modeling and parallel simulation of active networks called Active Networks Simulation Environment (or ANSE). ANSE utilizes the Time Warp synchronized kernel of WARPED (a general purpose discrete event simulation kernel) to enable parallel simulation of active network models. ANSE also includes complete support for the modeling and simulation of active networks based on PLAN (Packet Language for Active Networks). This paper presents the issues involved in the design and development of ANSE. The Application Programming Interface (API) of ANSE is presented along with the issues involved in utilizing it to develop support for PLAN based active networks.

In contemporary literature, as well as in state-of-the-art corporate practice, there are some methods of concrete mix design, from which the most popular are methods derived from The Three Equation Method. One of the most important features of concrete is compressive strength, which determines the concrete class. Predictable compressive strength of concrete is essential for concrete structure utilisation and is the main feature of its safety and durability. Recently, machine learning is gaining significant attention and future predictions for this technology are even more promising. Data mining on large sets of data attracts attention since machine learning algorithms have achieved a level in which they can recognise patterns which are difficult to recognise by human cognitive skills. In our paper, we would like to utilise state-of-the-art achievements in machine learning techniques for concrete mix design. In our research, we prepared an extensive database of concrete recipes with the according destructive laboratory tests, which we used to feed the selected optimal architecture of an artificial neural network.

Design and provisioning of WDM networks with multicast traffic grooming	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS												In this paper we consider the optimal design and provisioning of WDM networks for the grooming of multicast subwavelength traffic. We develop a unified framework for the optimal provisioning of different practical scenarios of multicast traffic grooming. We also introduce heuristic solutions. Optimal solutions are designed by exploiting the specifies of the problems to formulate Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Specifically, we solve the generic multicast problem in which, given a set of multicast sessions and, all destination nodes of a multicast session requiring the same amount of traffic, all demands need to be accommodated. The objective is to minimize the network cost by minimizing the number of higher layer electronic equipment and, simultaneously, minimizing the total number of wavelengths used. We also solve two interesting and practical variants of the traditional multicast problem, namely, multicasting with partial destination set reachability and multicasting with traffic thinning. For both variants, we also provide optimal as well as heuristic solutions. Also, the paper presents a number of examples based on the exact and heuristic approaches.																			0733-8716	1558-0008				APR	2006	24	4	2	S			37	53		10.1109/JSAC-OCN.2006.04004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC-OCN.2006.04004													WOS:000239014400005

Planning and implementing a suitable reverse logistics network could bring more profit, customer satisfaction, and a nice social picture for companies. But, most of logistics networks are not equipped to handle the return products in reverse channels. This paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to minimize the transportation and fixed opening costs in a multistage reverse logistics network. Since such network design problems belong to the class of NP-hard problems, we apply a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm with special neighborhood search mechanisms to find the near optimal solution. We also compare the associated numerical results through exact solutions in a set of problems to present the high-quality performance of the applied SA algorithm.

Filtering for discrete-time Markov jump systems with network transmitted mode	49TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control				49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 15-17, 2010	Atlanta, GA	IEEE				This paper is concerned with H-2 and H-infinity filter design for discrete-time Markov jump systems. The usual assumption of mode-dependent design, where the current Markov mode is available to the filter at every instant of time is substituted by the case where that availability is subject to another Markov chain. In other words, the mode is transmitted to the filter through a network with given transmission failure probabilities. The problem is solved by modeling a system with N modes as another with 2N modes and cluster availability. We also treat the case where the transition probabilities are not exactly known and demonstrate our conditions for calculating an H-infinity norm bound are less conservative than the available results in the current literature. Numerical examples show the applicability of the proposed results.

This paper deals with continuous reverse skyline queries in sensor networks, which retrieves reverse skylines as well as the set of nodes that reported them for continuous sampling epochs. Designing an energy-efficient approach to answer continuous reverse skyline queries is non-trivial because the reverse skyline query is not decomposable and a huge number of unqualified nodes need to report their sensor readings. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm that avoids transmission of updates from nodes that cannot influence the reverse skyline. We propose a data mapping scheme to estimate sensor readings and determine their dominance relationships without having to know the true values. We also theoretically analyze the properties for reverse skyline computation, and propose efficient pruning techniques while guaranteeing the correctness of the answer. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of our approach.

The high number of possible topological configurations, the discrete character of the link capacity options available in the marketplace, the non-linearity of the cost functions associated with the network topologies, constitute the main factors which make complex this design problem. As a result, only heuristic methods carl lead with a reasonable computing effort, to good feasible solutions, but not necessarily optimal. This paper proposes a heuristic method for generating in an economical manner network topologies which satisfy some reliability and quality; of service constraints.

This representation is constructed by the use of sector nonlinearity to convert a nonlinear model to the multiple rule base of the linear model, and a new sufficiency condition to guarantee asymptotic stability in the Lyapunov function is implemented in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

As proof of the concept, we present a device that generates four titrations of two dye solutions, blue and yellow, and combinatorially mixes the blue titrations with the yellow titrations to deliver the sixteen mixture combinations in separate outlet microchannels. Our device features four different flow levels made by stacking nine laser-cut Mylar laminates. The fluidic network has a symmetric design that guarantees that the flow rates are the same at all the outlets, with deviations attributable to imperfections in the fabrication, assembly, or perfusion processes.

Their usual engagements are to monitor and to perform the coverage of all specific targets in the observing fields permanently. These kinds of networks include numerous configurable directional sensors in which they can be utilized in one of the possible directions along with the one of their adjustable ranges. Although the energy harvesting methodology is being applied for these battery-hungry applications, the battery management and network lifetime maximization are still prominent challenges. In this paper, the network lifetime extension is formulated to a discrete optimization problem which is a famous non-deterministic polynomial time hardness (NP-Hard) problem. To solve this combinatorial problem, a discrete cuckoo search algorithm (D-CSA) is designed and is called in several rounds. A cover is a sub set of configured sensors capable of monitoring all targets in the observing field. In each round, the most efficient cover is constituted along with its activation time. In the determined activation time, the sensors in the cover are scheduled in wakeup mode whereas others are set in sleep mode to save energy. Despite other meta-heuristic algorithms, this proposed algorithm utilizes the novel defined discrete walking around procedures that makes to reach a good balance between exploration and exploitation in this complex search space. The proposed algorithm has been tested in different scenarios to be evaluated. The simulation results in the variety circumstances prove the superiority of the proposed algorithm is about 20.29%, 19.55%, 14.40%, 14.51%, 7.70% and 8.03% in term of average lifespan improvement against H-MNLAR, Hm-LifMax-BC, GA, ACOSC, H-GATS, and HDPSO algorithms, respectively.

Further, the research seeks to understand these firms' network dynamics in their continual adaptation to changing resource requirements throughout the internationalization process. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a multiple case study approach based on in-depth interviews with founders and key informants in BGs in the software industry, supplemented with extensive secondary data. Findings Results reveal that networking through social media is efficient and can be used to access vital resources and to build trusting relationships in a B2B context, yet in combination with physical networking. This research found several boundary conditions related to the mix of physical and virtual networking, i.e. the relationship culture in the industry, strategic importance of partner/customer, type of product complexity and managers' perceptions of the usefulness of social media in a B2B context. These conditions could evolve over time.

The literature offers resourceful methods that minimize the amount of communication required for continuous monitoring, where Geometric Monitoring (GM) is one of the most generally applicable ones. However, GM has unique communication requirements that require specialized network protocols to unlock the full potential of the algorithm. In this work, we show how application and protocol co-design can improve the real-life performance of GM, making it an application of practical value for real IoT deployments. We orchestrate the communication of GM to utilize the properties of a state-of-the-art wireless protocol (Crystal) that relies on synchronous transmissions and is designed for aperiodic traffic, as needed by GM. We bridge the existing gap between the capabilities of the protocol and the requirements of GM, especially in the case of periods of heavy communication. We do so by introducing an in-network aggregation technique relying on latent opportunities for aggregation that we exploit in Crystal's design, allowing us to reliably monitor duplicate sensitive aggregate functions, such as sum, average or variance. Our results from testbed experiments with a publicly available dataset show that the combination of GM and Crystal results in a very small duty-cycle, a 2.2x - 3.2x improvement compared to the baseline and up to 10x compared to previous work. We also show that our in-network aggregation technique reduces the duty-cycle by up to 1.38x.

Compared with the traditional optimal control algorithms for MASs, the proposed algorithm is designed on the basis of the event-triggered scheme which can save the communication and computation resources. First, the consensus tracking problem is transferred into the input-state stable (ISS) problem. Based on this, the event-triggered condition for each agent is designed and the event-triggered ADP is presented. Second, neural networks are introduced to simplify the application of the proposed algorithm. Third, the stability analysis of the MASs under the event-triggered conditions is provided and the estimate errors of the neural networks' weights are also proved to be ultimately uniformly bounded. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the event-triggered ADP consensus control method.																			1076-2787	1099-0526				MAR 1	2022	2022								6028054	10.1155/2022/6028054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6028054													WOS:000776748900001

A compound neural network is constructed to identify the dynamic nonlinear system including single-input-single-output (SISO) system and multiinput- multi-output (MIMO) system. One part of the CNN is a linear feedforward neural network (LFNN), which as used to approximate the nonlinear system. The other part is a recurrent neural network, which can shorten the difference between the LFNN and the real nonlinear process. Because the current control input is not included in the input vector of RNN, the inverse control laws of SISO and MIMO nonlinear systems can be easily obtained by CNN approximated models. The computation work is small since no further training is required for the inverse controller.

In addition, the uncertainty in decision elements adds to the complexity of this problem. Hence, this paper aims to propose a fuzzy multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (FMOMILP) model for a multi-echelon and multi-period CLSC network that minimize cost and environmental effects and maximize social impacts, simultaneously. At first, the model is converted into a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model by the weighted average method. Due to NP-hardness of the problem, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is developed to solve this multi-objective mathematical model. The obtained results are validated with the non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA), due to there is no benchmark for this problem. In addition, different numerical instances are presented and analyzed with different measures in order to indicate the efficiency of proposed algorithms. The provided results demonstrate that the proposed NSGA-II algorithm is an adequate tool to solve the multi-objective problem of CLSC network design. (C) 2018 PEI, University of Maribor.

Specifically, the network-induced delays and sampling intervals are assumed random following a joint probability density function. For stability analysis, the system is modeled in the discrete-time domain. In this context, both the moment stability and Lyapunov stability are considered, for which conditions guaranteeing stability are derived leveraging a vectorization technique.

A routing test-bed is essential to understand a routing (path-selection) algorithm's dynamic behaviour and evaluate its performance. Such a test-bed, called QUARTS, has been built to design routing protocols over ATM networks. QUARTS is a discrete-event-driven test-bed. In QUARTS, a physical ATM network is decomposed into various functional modules; i.e., switch, link, end-system and routing modules. Using these modules as building blocks, one can construct any arbitrary network topology. Through a friendly and efficient graphical user interface of QUARTS, the network configuration and simulation can be easily manipulated. A comprehensive description of the test-bed is presented in this paper along with some simulation results from its use in the development of connection admission control algorithms for efficient dynamic routing over ATM networks.																			0840-8688					AUG	1995	20	3					117	120																WOS:A1995TD49900004

The objective of the problem is to minimize the sum of transportation cost, flow paths construction cost and penalty cost for non-smooth material flows, i.e., flows with turns. A mixed integer programming model is given for the problem and a three-phase heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the problem. In the suggested algorithm, we generate an initial flow network by determining locations of input/output points and flow paths sequentially in the first and second phases, respectively, and then improve it by changing locations of input/output points and flow paths iteratively in the third phase. To evaluate the performance of the suggested algorithms, a series of computational experiments are performed on well-known problem instances as well as randomly generated test problems. Results of computational experiments show that the suggested algorithm gives good solutions in a short computation time.																			0020-7543	1366-588X					2008	46	18					4963	4980		10.1080/00207540701338895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207540701338895													WOS:000259100300001

Not only the geometric topology properties (such as fractal characteristics) of a single fracture but also the connection topology properties (interconnection characteristics between fractures) of the fracture network have an important impact on the fluid flow in fracture networks. In this study, the connection topology properties of the fracture network in the fractured coal are explored based on the complex network theory for the first time. The property parameters such as the fracture node degree, the clustering coefficient, and the average path length are analyzed. It shows that the average clustering coefficient of the fracture network in fractured coal is larger, and the average path length is smaller. The connection property of the fracture network in the fractured coal presents a typical "small-world" clustering model. Further, by considering the fractal characteristics of the single fracture and the clustering characteristics of the fracture network, an improved clustered fractal discrete fracture network (DFN) model is developed. Then, based on the lattice Boltzmann method, the permeability properties of the generated clustered fractal DFNs are analyzed. The results show that the permeability of DFNs is positively correlated with the average clustering coefficient of fracture network, and negatively correlated with the fractal dimension of fracture. Therefore, the topological clustering characteristics of fracture networks and the fractal characteristics of fractures cannot be ignored in describing the fluid flow in the fracture network, and our clustered fractal DFN model provides a new idea for guiding the optimization design in DFN engineering.

However, the precise values of some parameters are difficult to obtain in practice, so it is reasonable to denote this type of problem as uncertain programming. In this paper, regarding both used products' volumes and processing capacities of logistics facilities as interval numbers, an interval programming model for the network's optimal design is developed, and then the model is transformed to a deterministic mixed integer programming model by converting its constraints with interval numbers to respective crisp equivalents with the help of constraints' credibility. It is hereby believed that a good foundation is established for the model's further application. Besides, a numerical example is given to show the application of proposed model in design decision-making.																					978-7-111-05712-3				2008							601	605																WOS:000261585600120

Mixed-integer programming model and branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm for urban bus network design and timetabling	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												This study solves the simultaneous planning problem of network design and timetabling for urban bus systems. An innovative mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is formulated and a parallel branch-and-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The key idea of the model formulation and the solution algorithm is to represent a bus timetable with a route and a dispatch pattern. An aggregation and greedy algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the pricing subproblem. The cuts of disaggregate coupling inequalities are dynamically added to strengthen the lower bound. A computational study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology. The comparison with alternative solution approaches indicates that the parallel BPC algorithm is superior to solving the MIP formulations with the off-the-shelf MIP solver. Different values of model parameters are also tested, and various statistics of operators and passengers are reported for the cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These adopted redundant channels can effectively improve the reliability of networked systems from the viewpoint of engineering. Two series of stochastic variables satisfying Bernoulli distribution, are introduced to govern the infinite distributed delays and schedule the redundant channels. By utilizing both stochastic analysis and Lyapunov functional approach, we obtain a lot of sufficient conditions to ensure the desired H-infinity performance, while the mean-square stability is also satisfied for this investigated state estimation issues of ANNs.

Based on the MV technology, a modular transit network system (MTNS) concept is proposed to overcome the mismatch between fixed vehicle capacity and spatially varying travel demand in traditional public transportation systems. To achieve the optimal MTNS design, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed to balance the tradeoff between the vehicle operation cost and the passenger trip time cost. The nonlinear model is reformulated into a computationally tractable linear model. The linear model solves the lower and upper bounds of the original nonlinear model to produce a near-optimal solution to the MTNS design. This reformulated linear model can be solved with off-the-shelf commercial solvers (e.g., Gurobi). Two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and its effectiveness in reducing system costs.

A new type of distributed faulttolerance consensus filter is designed, where each sensor can communicate with the neighbouring sensors, and filtering can be performed in a distributed coordinated function. Because the sensor networks may be disturbed by loss of transmitting effectiveness, the performance of sensor network will be degraded by using the faulted signals. Under the unknown assumption for the failures, adaptive laws are proposed to estimate the failures factors.

The communication constraint considered is that only one network node is allowed to access a shared communication channel during one time-slot, and a feedback control is performed with only partially available measurements and control inputs. By taking random packet loss into consideration, a stochastic switched system model is presented to describe the NCS. A sufficient condition is derived for the NCS to be mean-square exponentially stable, and it is shown that the system performance specified by the exponential decay rate critically depends on the network accessing rates (NARs) of the network nodes and the packet loss probability. The state feedback controller and scheduling protocol, which allocates the NARs, are co-designed such that the NCS achieves a minimal decay rate. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design approach. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The major work of this paper is proposing an optimal topological design model of preset connection lines, aiming at a distributed power generation network based on different nodal invulnerability requirements. Moreover, the important innovation of this paper lies in that the perspective is shifted from the system to an individual node of a different type. When a node malfunction occurs, the faulty node can be connected to its neighbor nodes by closing a switch to achieve energy exchange. The distributed generation network consists of a series of nodes that can realize self-sufficiency and can be classified into three types with different levels of importance according to their tasks. The nodes of different types must meet different requirements of destructibility. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to solve the optimal topology design problem. In addition, this paper also analyzes the influence of changing nodal power generation capacity and nodal type, and the simulation results show the practicability of the proposal.					tao, zhang/KHY-8716-2024; Zhang, Tao/AAY-3651-2021; Huang, Shengjun/L-5618-2018	Zhang, Tao/0000-0002-0432-2942; Huang, Shengjun/0000-0002-4703-9020														2073-8994				MAY	2022	14	5							1014	10.3390/sym14051014	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym14051014													WOS:000804883000001

Routing-Aware Design of Indoor Wireless Sensor Networks Using an Interactive Tool	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL												In this paper, we present an interactive design tool that can assist rapid prototyping and deployment of wireless sensor networks for building automation systems. We argue that it is possible to design networks that are more resilient to failures and have longer lifetime if the behavior of routing algorithms (RAs) is taken into account at design time. Resiliency can be increased by algorithmically adding redundancy to the network at locations where it can be maximally leveraged by RAs during operation. Lifetime can be increased by placing routers where they are most needed according to the expected data traffic patterns to improve the quality of the transmission. The network synthesis problem is formulated as an optimization problem. We propose a mixed-integer linear program to solve it exactly and a polynomial-time heuristic that returns close-to-optimal results in a shorter time. We analyze the performance of the designed networks by using OPNET simulation. Results show that our tool can assist in designing sensor networks that have high throughput and consume power efficiently.

Discrete-Time Neural Inverse Optimal Control for Nonlinear Systems via Passivation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS												This paper presents a discrete-time inverse optimal neural controller, which is constituted by combination of two techniques: 1) inverse optimal control to avoid solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with nonlinear system optimal control and 2) on-line neural identification, using a recurrent neural network trained with an extended Kalman filter, in order to build a model of the assumed unknown nonlinear system.

Water systems need to expand because of demographic growth. Therefore, evaluating and increasing system capacity is crucial. Specifically, we analyze network capacity as one of the main features of a system. When the network capacity starts to decrease, there is a risk that continuous supply will become intermittent. This paper discusses how network expansion carried out throughout the network life span typically reduces network capacity, thus transforming a system originally designed to work with continuous supply into a system with intermittent supply. A method is proposed to expand the network capacity in an environment of economic scarcity through a greedy algorithm that enables the definition of a schedule for pipe modification stages, and thus efficiently expands the network capacity. This method is, at the same time, an important step in the process of changing a water system from intermittent back to continuous supply an achievement that remains one of the main challenges related to water and health in developing countries.

Firstly, it overcomes the technical difficulty that the dynamic segmentation and process segmentation of the automatic generation architecture in traditional choreography cannot achieve global optimization. Secondly, it is an automatic generation architecture for end-to-end continuous dance notation with access to temporal classifiers. Based on this, a dynamic time-stamping model is designed for frame clustering. Finally, it is concluded through experiments that the model successfully achieves high-performance movement time-stamping. And combined with continuous motion recognition technology, it realizes the refined production of continuous choreography with global motion recognition and then marks motion duration. This research effectively realizes the efficient and refined production of digital continuous choreography, provides advanced technical means for choreography education, and provides useful experience for school network choreography education.																			1687-5265	1687-5273				JUL 31	2022	2022								7242637	10.1155/2022/7242637	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/7242637								35958751					WOS:000855557500025

The problem is comprised of two parts: (1) multicast routing and wavelength assignment of light-trees, and (2) the design of light-tree based logical topology for multicast streams. In the first part, we use Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to solve the optimal routing and wavelength assignment problem of light-trees with an end-to-end delay bound, and obtain the optimal placement of power splitters and wavelength converters. The numerical results show that networks with just a few power splitters and wavelength converters can efficiently carry multicast data. In the second part, we extend the above formulation to design the logical topology based on light-trees for multicast streams. In our approach, a light-tree can carry data of multiple multicast streams, and data of a multicast stream may traverse multiple light-trees to reach a receiver. The numerical results show that our approach use network resources more efficiently, as compared to the approach with a separate light-tree for a multicast stream and to the approach of transporting multicast streams over lightpath based logical networks.

This paper investigates the self-triggered MPC problem for discrete-time linear systems under network environments to reduce communication load. We first propose a novel cost function which explicitly takes the communication cost into consideration. Based on the new cost function, an adaptive self-triggered MPC strategy is designed in the sense that the self-triggered time intervals can be adaptively adjusted via optimization. We further develop a simplified approach to solving the optimal control sequences and the optimal self-triggered time intervals. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed and we show that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable if some mild controllability conditions are satisfied. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed algorithm is verified via simulation studies.

J	Liu, SY; Zamani, M				Liu, Siyuan; Zamani, Majid			Compositional synthesis of opacity-preserving finite abstractions for interconnected systems	AUTOMATICA												In this paper, we propose a compositional approach to construct opacity-preserving finite abstractions (a.k.a symbolic models) for networks of discrete-time nonlinear control systems. Particularly, we introduce new notions of simulation functions that characterize the distance between control systems while preserving opacity properties across them. Instead of treating large-scale systems in a monolithic manner, we develop a compositional scheme to construct the finite abstractions together with the overall opacity-preserving simulation functions based on those of the smaller subsystems. For a network of incrementally input-to-state stable control subsystems and under some small-gain type condition, an algorithm for designing local quantization parameters is presented to orderly build the local symbolic models of subsystems. We show that the network of those constructed symbolic models simulates the original network for an a-priori defined abstraction accuracy while preserving its opacity properties.

Stability analysis of support systems using a coupled FEM-DFN model (Case study: a diversion tunnel at Lorestan dam site, Iran)	JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT												Various structural discontinuities, which form a discrete fracture network, play a significant role in the failure conditions and stability of the rock masses around underground excavations. Several continuum numerical methods have been used to study the stability of underground excavations in jointed rock masses but only few of them can take into account the influence of the pre-existing natural fractures. In this work, the pre-existing fractures are explicitly modeled as a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model, which is fully coupled with the FEM modeling for stability analysis of support systems in a diversion tunnel at the Rudbar Lorestan dam site. Hence, at first, using the surveyed data in the diversion tunnel and an estimation of the suitable probability distribution function on geometric characteristics of the existing joint sets in this region, the 3D DFN model was simulated using the stochastic discrete fracture networks generator program, DFN-FRAC(3D). In the second step, a coupled 2D Finite Element Method and the prepared stochastic model were used for analysis of existent (based on technical reports) recommended support systems. The objective here is to grasp the role of the fracture networks on the results of the tunnel stability analysis using FEM modeling and also to compare the results with those obtained through stability analysis without considering the effect of fractures.

The measure of transinformation in discrete entropy theory and the transinformation-distance (T-D) curves are used to quantify the efficiency of sampling locations and sampling frequencies in a monitoring network. The existing uncertainties in the T-D curves are taken in to account using the fuzzy set theory. The C-means clustering method is also used to classify the study area to some homogenous zones. The fuzzy T-D curve of the zones is then used in a multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm-based optimization model.

J	Chen, K; Xu, SH; Haralambides, H				Chen, Kang; Xu, Shihe; Haralambides, Hercules			Determining hub port locations and feeder network designs: The case of China-West Africa trade	TRANSPORT POLICY												Considering the impacts of low port distribution (i.e., concentration of ports in a certain geographic area) and liner network development, we study hub port locations, current and future, along the West African coastline. We feel that the relationship between hub port locations and liner network structures should be further researched. To that effect, we apply our modelling to the Asia - West Africa trade, in view of China's increasing economic involvement in the development of the African continent. In formulating our model, we specify the relationship between the path choice behavior of shippers, the liner network and the hub port location. To do this, we split the problem into two associated subproblems: a liner network design with a non-discrete calling port set (LNDNS) and the shippers' path choice problem (SPCP). In contrast to conventional discrete location models, our method relaxes the usual constraint requiring hub port alternatives be listed a priori. This allows us to consider the development of new port infrastructure, in green-field areas, along the West African coast. We believe such an approach-i.e., the identification of 'greenfield' sites-could be of particular interest to infrastructure financiers, such as the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, as a port policy blueprint, for regions such as West Africa, characterized by low port density. Our results show that Abidjan, Cotonou and Lome, located in the central part of the West African coastline, are more important for the China-West Africa container transport system, and could potentially be selected as hub ports. Currently, the western and southern parts of the coastline do not appear to be suitable for this function; ports there, however, could be developed to important feeder ports in the future, in a pendulum type of network design, as we demonstrate. Interestingly, we also find that, as the number of routes increases, the structure of the liner network changes from circular to hub-and-spoke. Finally, the networks we design and present in our model show how shippers' path choice behavior affects liner network design and the location of hub ports.

In particular, the proposed algorithm has the ability to jointly design multiple beamformers, so that a specific subset of users attains certain target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) whereas the SINRs of the remaining users are balanced subject to multiple linear constraints. The design framework considered is applicable to both the overlay cognitive radio network (CRN) and the underlay CRN; however, the algorithm is described for the example of an underlay CRN to include a very general mathematical framework. We maximize the worst-case users' SINR of a particular set of users while satisfying the target SINRs of the remaining users subject to the total transmission power and the interference leakage constraints. This algorithm is solved using the uplink-downlink duality and subgradient method. The condition for convergence is analytically derived.

By implementing an average dwell time approach with a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, we obtain some delay-dependent sufficient conditions guaranteeing the robust exponential stability of the considered switched fuzzy neural networks.

The proposed methods use simulated data to learn effective soliton detection by suppressing nonlinear impairments beyond amplifier noise, including intrinsic inter-soliton interaction, Gordon-Haus effect -induced timing jitter, and their combined impact. We first present a comprehensive study of these nonlinear impairments based on numerical simulations. Then, two neural network designs are developed based on a regression network and a classifier. We estimate the achievable information rates of the proposed learning -based soliton detection schemes as well as two modelbased benchmark schemes, including the nonlinear Fourier transform eigenvalue estimation and continuous spectrum -aided eigenvalue estimation schemes. Our results demonstrate that both learning -based designs lead to substantial performance gains when compared to the benchmark schemes. Importantly, we highlight that exploiting the channel memory, introduced by solitonic interactions, can yield additional gains in the achievable information rate. Through a comparative analysis of the two neural network designs, we establish that the classifier design exhibits superior adaptability to interaction impairment and is more suitable for symbol detection tasks in the context of the investigated scenarios.

J	Moeini, MM; Sounas, DL				Moeini, Mohammad Moein; Sounas, Dimitrios L.			Discrete space optical signal processing	OPTICA												As digital circuits are approaching the limits of Moore's law, a great deal of effort has been directed to alternative computing approaches. Among them, the old concept of optical signal processing (OSP) has attracted attention, revisited in the light of metamaterials and nano-photonics. This approach has been successful in realizing basic mathematical operations, such as derivatives and integrals, but it is difficult to be applied to more complex ones. Here, inspired by digital filters, we propose a radically new OSP approach, able to realize arbitrary mathematical operations over a nano-photonic platform. Our concept consists in first sampling an optical signal in space through an array of optical antennas and then realizing the desired mathematical operation in discrete space through a network with a discrete number of input and output ports. The design of such network boils down to the design of a structure with a given scattering matrix, which for arbitrarily complex operations can be accomplished through inverse design algorithms. We demonstrate this concept for the case of spatial differentiation through a heuristic design based on a waveguide with periodic arrays of input/output channels at its opposite walls. Our approach combines the robustness and generality of traditional Fourier-based OSP with the compactness of nano-photonics and has the potential of transforming the design of OSP systems with applications in image processing and analog computing.

Therefore this paper proposes a study pattern including five processes of "cognition-familiarity-simulationverification-design" on principle of network bottom layer, and formulates continuous and interlocking experiment content which can make students possess independent design ability.																			1951-6851		978-90786-77-72-7				2013							930	932																WOS:000327396400252

Many network operators are striving for different ways to reduce their operating cost while still providing excellent services to their customers. One of the possible savings that can be made is to apply software planning tools to automate network designs at the lowest possible cost. In this paper, we describe an AI based system which can automate/optimize the planning process. It facilitates the implementation of different optimization algorithms to solve network design problems. A case study of physical layer design for FTTH networks is provided. FTTH is considered to be the last mile of access network which is critical to provide bandwidth-intensive services such as high speed Internet access, video on demand, online gaming, etc. In this paper, an overview of the system is provided. The problem definition of the FTTH network design and three optimization approaches (i.e. Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA)) are described. Finally, different sizes of networks will be used to illustrate the performance of each approach.

The novel state-feedback controllers, which include integral terms and discontinuous facts, are designed to realize the global synchronization between the drive system and response system. By applying the Lyapunov functional method and matrix inequality analysis technique, the global finite-time and fixed-time synchronization conditions are addressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

For chemo-resistive gas sensors, a precise estimation can be challenging because of the measurement variance and non-linear nature of the gas sensors, especially in a low concentration environment. A simple application of the deep learning models, however, does not yield sufficiently accurate predictions of the concentrations of multiple gases in gas mixtures; thus, it is essential to develop basic strategies for enhancing the accuracy in all possible ways. In this study, we develop a deep learning framework for achieving high accuracy of gas concentration prediction by studying the essential pre-processing techniques, learning task design, and architecture design. For the pre-processing, we study several aspects of processing time-series sensor data and identify the key techniques for complementing deep learning models' limitations. We utilize the mixed-gas nature for the learning task design and show that multi-task learning can generate a synergistic effect. Additionally, we show that a further improvement is possible by considering on-off classification as a part of the hybrid learning task. Concerning architecture design, we investigate Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models after applying the identified pre-processing techniques. CNN outperformed other models in a joint analysis with the learning task. The effectiveness of our framework is confirmed with the UCI gas mixture dataset acquired using a chemical detection platform where 16 chemical sensors are exposed to ethylene, CO, and methane gases. Using the dataset, we study the basic techniques that can be effective to mixed-gas prediction. For the UCI dataset, our deep learning framework achieves a significant improvement in estimation accuracy when compared to the previous studies.

We describe the novel features of this problem, which are based on the possible (but still unexploited) knowledge on the composition of the disaggregated loads in containers and semitrailers entering the port. In this problem, the transportation requests of these loads are highly customized and have different delivery costs. We must determine the paths of vehicles and loads, which result in costs paid by carriers and customers, as well as external costs for the city itself. The resulting network design problem is faced from the holistic viewpoint of a possible mobility manager, which must minimize the overall system costs. We present a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) for this problem. Since it is very difficult to solve by standard MILP solvers, we present a Tabu Search algorithm exploiting the specific problem features. The computational experiments show to what extent this problem can be tackled by a general purpose mixed-integer programming solver and the Tabu Search algorithm.

Some topological invariants are mathematical tools for the analysis of connection properties of a particular network. The Cellular Neural Network (CNN) is a computer paradigm in the field of machine learning and computer science. In this article we have given a close expression to dominating invariants computed by the dominating degree for a cellular neural network. Moreover, we have also presented a 3D comparison between dominating invariants and classical degree-based indices to show that, in some cases, dominating invariants give a better correlation on the cellular neural network as compared to classical indices.

There is an urgent need to develop effective representations of real-world 3D objects and further enable the matching and retrieval of engineering designs. This paper presents a new self-organizing network representation of 3D objects. Each voxel of the 3D object is a node in a network, and the edge is dependent on node closeness in space. Then, the network is self-organized by balancing attractive and repulsive forces between the nodes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of network representation by reassembling the geometry of 3D objects. (C) 2020 CIRP. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The neuronal networks generating such alternate rhythmic activity are generally thought to rely on pacemaker cells or well-designed circuits consisting of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. However, experiments in organotypic cultures of embryonic rat spinal cord have shown that neuronal networks with purely excitatory and random connections may oscillate due to their synaptic depression, even without pacemaker cells. In this theoretical study, we investigate what happens if two such networks are symmetrically coupled by a small number of excitatory connections. We discuss a time-discrete mean-field model describing the average activity and the average synaptic depression of the two networks. Depending on the parameter values of the depression, the oscillations will be in phase, antiphase, quasiperiodic, or phase trapped. We put forward the hypothesis that pattern generators may rely on activity-dependent tuning of synaptic depression.

J	Naeeni, HS; Sabbaghi, N				Naeeni, Hannan Sadjady; Sabbaghi, Navid			Sustainable supply chain network design: A case of the glass manufacturer in Asia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS												Traditionally, profit maximization was the major objective for many businesses. However, due to growing stakeholders' pressure and awareness about the social and environmental impacts of supply chain activities, many companies are now focused on optimizing their profits, while reducing negative impacts of their activities on planet and society. While sustainable development requires concurrent and balanced consideration of social, environmental and economic dimensions, unbalanced approaches have been adopted both in real world practices, and in academic literature. We contribute to the stream of research in the literature that tries to address this gap. We propose a multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MOMIP) model for sustainable supply chain network design (SSCND), encompassing economic, environmental, and social objectives. Both strategic and tactical network design decision variables are considered, including location, size, and technology type of facilities, along with determining the flow of materials and transportation modes. The Normalized Normal Constraint Method is applied to generate evenly distributed Pareto frontiers. The case of a glass manufacturing company in Asia is used to demonstrate applicability of the model and solution procedure to real-world problems. Non-dominated solutions are analyzed, and a more sustainable and balanced network design alternative is proposed, which outperforms the current network configuration in terms of all three dimensions of sustainability. Managerial implications and future research directions are discussed.

The design is implemented as a hardware generator written in Chisel, which is a software framework for writing hardware circuit generators. Our generator is designed to use minimal hardware resources and is very flexible in regards to various aspects of the convolution operation, including: image size, kernel size, image bitwidth, kernel bitwidth, activation function, and more. The processing unit is configurable only at generation time, thus we don't pay the price of using more general hardware, instead we can tailor it to the problem at hand.																			2334-3133		979-8-3503-3277-3				2023							128	131		10.1109/DDECS57882.2023.10139758	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DDECS57882.2023.10139758													WOS:001012062000025

To enforce such constraints in real-world experiments, fast and accurate perception for foothold detection and estimation is needed. In this work, a deep visual perception model is designed to accurately estimate step length of the next step, which serves as input to the feedback controller to enable vision-in-the loop dynamic walking on discrete terrain. In particular, a custom convolutional neural network architecture is designed and trained to pi-edict step length to the next foothold using a sampled image preview of the upcoming terrain at foot impact. The visual input is offered only at the beginning of each step and is shown to be sufficient for the job of dynamically stepping onto discrete footholds. Through extensive numerical studies, we show that the robot is able to successfully autonomously walk for over 100 steps without failure on a discrete terrain with footholds randomly positioned within a step length range of [45 : 85] centimeters.																					978-1-5386-4678-6				2017							418	424																WOS:000427350100060

Although, nowadays, responsiveness and social responsibility of networks could also be regarded as important measures that could attract more consumers to use hydrogen. Accordingly, this paper aims to improve the reliability and social responsibility of a hydrogen supply chain along with its economic and environmental aspects. To ensure the network's responsiveness, a new objective function is extended that maximizes the reliability of products' delivery. Also, a novel reliability approach is developed to immune the network against disruptions. As a new sustainability indicator, social factors are considered in the design of the hydrogen supply chain. Finally, a mixed possibilistic flexible programming method is proposed to assure the outputs' reliability. The results illustrate that by 28.4% enhancement in cost objective, the value of environmental, social, and reliability objectives are desirably improved 39.2%, 45.6%, and 24.1%, respectively.

J	Sahu, GC; Bandyopadhyay, S				Sahu, Gopal Chandra; Bandyopadhyay, Santanu			Energy optimization in heat integrated water allocation networks	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												In this paper, linear programming formulations, complemented by concept based pinch analysis results, are developed to target the minimum energy requirements in a heat integrated fixed flow rate water allocation networks. These formulations can be applied for the cases of heat integration through isothermal and non-isothermal mixing in water allocation networks involving single as well as multiple contaminants. The earlier reported approaches are based on linear programming formulation for the case of isothermal mixing and either mixed integer non-linear programming or discontinuous non-linear programming formulations for the case of non-isothermal mixing. It has been observed that the earlier reported methodologies produce sub-optimal results for the case of non-isothermal mixing. However, the proposed methodologies produce the optimum results because of the rigorously proved linear formulation. Utility requirements for isothermal as well as for non-isothermal mixing cases are compared over a range of minimum approach temperatures, to evaluate the energy performance using illustrative examples.

In this paper, we focus on the optimal design problem of multi-period closed-loop supply chain network of hazardous products considering uncertain demands and returns, expandable facility capacities and social acceptable risk simultaneously. In each period, the built facilities have the ability to expand within a certain scope. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model, which can determine the number, location and expansion scale of the facilities and the forward and reverse logistics quantities between the facilities in each period simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the expected cost over the multi-period planning horizon, including the facilities building, operating and expansion costs and the costs related to manufacturing, collection, processing, recovery and transportation. In order to solve the proposed model, two classes of dummy variables are introduced to equivalently transform it into a mixed-integer linear programming, which can be optimally solved by LINGO. A case study is presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed model. The dynamic design with expansion strategy addressed in this paper is compared with two different strategies of static design and dynamic design without expansion. The results highlight that the dynamic design with expansion strategy has the advantages in saving expenses and raising the average expected collection rate of hazardous wastes.

Results and Conclusions: Measures accumulated over times similar to the duration of infection are more informative than are static cross sections. The patterns of sexual mixing and network structure influence patterns of infection. In particular, the establishment of infection is most sensitive to the proportion of nonmonogamous pairs, the component distribution and cohesion among those with high activity. The subsequent prevalence is most sensitive to the assortativeness of mixing in the high-activity class and a measure of cohesion, both of which reflect the decrease in prevalence brought about by less widespread connections, A person's risk for infection is determined by local rather than global network structures.

The inability to accurately identify the non-linearities online or offline motivates the design of robust controllers using adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). In this study, an ADP-based robust neural control scheme is developed for a class of unknown CT non-linear systems. To begin with, the robust non-linear control problem is converted into a non-linear optimal control problem via constructing a value function for the nominal system. Then an ADP algorithm is developed to solve the non-linear optimal control problem. The ADP algorithm employs actor-critic dual networks to approximate the control policy and the value function, respectively. Based on this architecture, only system data is necessary to update simultaneously the actor neural network (NN) weights and the critic NN weights. Meanwhile, the persistence of excitation assumption is no longer required by using the Monte Carlo integration method. The closed-loop system with unknown non-linearities is demonstrated to be asymptotically stable under the obtained optimal control. Finally, two examples are provided to validate the developed method.

The 4(th) Generation (4G) wireless mobile internet networks combine current existing 3G cellular networks (i.e., IPv6, OFDM, CDMA2000, WCDMA and TD_SCDMA) and Wi-Fi (i.e., Wireless LAN) networks with fixed internet to support wireless mobile internet as the same quality of service as fixed internet, which is an evolution not only to move beyond the limitations and problems of 3G, but also to enhance the quality of services, to increase the bandwidth and to reduce the cost of the resource. IPv6 is a basic protocol for running on both 4G and 5G, which works on single bandwidth of 4G. The 5(th) wireless mobile internet network is a completed wireless communication with almost no limitation. In this paper, we propose Mix-Bandwidth data path for 5G real wireless world.

J	König, J; Krahn, U; Binder, H				Koenig, Jochem; Krahn, Ulrike; Binder, Harald			Visualizing the flow of evidence in network meta-analysis and characterizing mixed treatment comparisons	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE												Network meta-analysis techniques allow for pooling evidence from different studies with only partially overlapping designs for getting a broader basis for decision support. The results are network-based effect estimates that take indirect evidence into account for all pairs of treatments. The results critically depend on homogeneity and consistency assumptions, which are sometimes difficult to investigate. To support such evaluation, we propose a display of the flow of evidence and introduce new measures that characterize the structure of a mixed treatment comparison. Specifically, a linear fixed effects model for network meta-analysis is considered, where the network estimates for two treatments are linear combinations of direct effect estimates comparing these or other treatments. The linear coefficients can be seen as the generalization of weights known from classical meta-analysis. We summarize properties of these coefficients and display them as a weighted directed acyclic graph, representing the flow of evidence. Furthermore, measures are introduced that quantify the direct evidence proportion, the mean path length, and the minimal parallelism of mixed treatment comparisons. The graphical display and the measures are illustrated for two published network meta-analyses. In these applications, the proposed methods are seen to render transparent the process of data pooling in mixed treatment comparisons. They can be expected to be more generally useful for guiding and facilitating the validity assessment in network meta-analysis. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The ANN system is input in the form of a Data Flow Graph (DFG) of operators. The output is a high-level interconnection description of mixed analog/digital building block circuits that is generated by searching a multidimensional design space to satisfy the throughput requirements and minimize an area-time cost function. A combination of quantitative analysis and behavioral modeling techniques tackles the problems of hardware nonidealities by screening suitable analog circuits. Digital hardware is employed when no analog circuit is found that satisfies the performance requirements of any operation. A heuristic partitioning scheme reduces the interfaces between blocks of circuits operating in analog and digital modes. The parallelism in ANN systems is handled by a new scheduling and allocating procedure that selectively sequentializes groups of operations with the goal of iteratively improving an area-time cost function. The synthesizer is also capable of embedding hardware units that are intended to operate asynchronously. The synthesis methodology is illustrated with two design examples.																			0278-0070					SEP	1994	13	9					1073	1087		10.1109/43.310897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/43.310897													WOS:A1994PC84000001

By approximating the solutions of the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, a local performance index is defined to solve the optimal synchronization problem for discrete-time nonlinear complex dynamic networks without knowing the node dynamics and the topology of the directed graph. Based on this, an off-policy iteration algorithm is designed to iteratively improve the target policy, and the convergence of the algorithm is proved theoretically. Actor-critic neural networks along with the gradient descent approach are employed to approximate optimal control policies and performance index functions using the data generated by applying prescribed behavior policies.

J	Chow, JYJ; Regan, AC				Chow, Joseph Y. J.; Regan, Amelia C.			Network-based real option models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL												Building on earlier work to incorporate real option methodologies into network modeling, two models are proposed. The first is the network option design problem, which maximizes the expanded net present value of a network investment as a function of network design variables with the option to defer the committed design investment. The problem is shown to be a generalized version of the network design problem and the multi-period network design problem. A heuristic based on radial basis functions is used to solve the problem for continuous link expansion with congestion effects. The second model is a link investment deferral option set, which decomposes the network investment deferral option into individual, interacting link or project investments. This model is a project selection problem under uncertainty, where each link or project can be deferred such that the expanded net present value is maximized. The option is defined in such a way that a lower bound can be solved using an exact method based on multi-option least squares Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical tests are conducted with the classical Sioux Falls network and compared to earlier published results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mateus, GR; Luna, HPL; Sirihal, AB				Mateus, GR; Luna, HPL; Sirihal, AB			Heuristics for distribution network design in telecommunication	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS												A distribution network problem arises in a lower level of an hierarchical modeling approach for telecommunication network planning. This paper describes a model and proposes a lagrangian heuristic for designing a distribution network. Our model is a complex extension of a capacitated single commodity network design problem. We are given a network containing a set of sources with maximum available supply, a set of sinks with required demands, and a set of transshipment points. We need to install adequate capacities on the arcs to route the required flow to each sink, that may be an intermediate or a terminal node of an arborescence. Capacity can only be installed in discrete levels, i.e., cables are available only in certain standard capacities. Economies of scale induce the use of a unique higher capacity cable instead of an equivalent set of lower capacity cables to cover the flow requirements of any link. A path from a source to a terminal node requires a lower flow in the measure that we are closer to the terminal node, since many nodes in the path may be intermediate sinks. On the other hand, the reduction of cable capacity levels across any path is inhibited by splicing costs. The objective is to minimize the total cost of the network, given by the sum of the arc capacity (cables) costs plus the splicing costs along the nodes. In addition to the limited supply and the node demand requirements, the model incorporates constraints on the number of cables installed on each edge and the maximum number of splices at each node. The model is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem because it is an extension of the Steiner problem in graphs. Moreover, the discrete levels of cable capacity and the need to consider splicing costs increase the complexity of the problem. We include some computational results of the lagrangian heuristics that works well in the practice of computer aided distribution network design.

The Markovian jumping parameters in connection weight matrices and discrete time-varying delay are assumed to be different. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov Krasovsldi functional and combining with the reciprocally convex approach and Wirtinger-based integral inequality (this inequality gives a tighter upper bound), some sufficient conditions are established. They guarantee that the estimation error converges to zero exponentially in the mean square sense. Compared with existing results, the obtained criteria are more effective due to the application of Matrix decomposition method which sufficiently utilizes the information of Lyapunov matrices.

Bosonic discrete supersymmetry for quasi-two-dimensional optical arrays	PHOTONICS RESEARCH												We apply the notion of discrete supersymmetry based on matrix factorization to quantum systems consisting of coupled bosonic oscillators to construct isospectral bosonic quantum networks. By using the algebra that arises due to the indistinguishability of bosonic particles, we write down the Schrodinger equations for these oscillators in the different boson-number sectors. By doing so, we obtain, for every partner quantum network, a system of coupled differential equations that can be emulated by classical light propagation in optical waveguide arrays. This mathematical scheme allows us to build quasi-two-dimensional optical arrays that are either isospectral or share only a subset of their spectrum after deliberately omitting some chosen eigenstates from the spectrum. As an example, we use this technique (which we call bosonic discrete supersymmetry or BD-SUSY) to design two optical, silica-based waveguide arrays consisting of six and three elements, respectively, with overlapping eigenspectrum.

Different from the existing studies, in the considered interconnected system, each remote control station is allowed to retrieve event-triggered sampled-data from interacting control stations, while the number of coupling communication connections is upper bounded in a kappa-sparse sense rather than permanently fixed. The distributed event-triggered scheduling problem subject to such a cardinality constraint is nontrivial due to its combinatorial nature. Different from the existing l(1) norm based iterative convexification approach, a direct design approach based on mixed-integer programming is proposed to handle the cardinality constraint. Furthermore, an explicit K-sparse distributed scheduling algorithm is designed for the networked interconnected system via the Lyapunov functional method and some matrix manipulations. The proposed approach is finally applied to a three-machine power system to illustrate its effectiveness. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, in real road networks, the object's speed and the road network's structure change frequently Hence, these would make the existing methods ineffective when applying to the real-world road network environment To overcome the aforementioned disadvantages, we propose a Data Modeling approach of Road Networks with traffic rules (called DMRNR) and design a novel Expanding Tree-based Continuous k Nearest Neighbors algorithm (abbreviate for ExTCKNN) that can be well adopted to the actual road network environment. The algorithm consists of three steps: 1) it obtains the query results to store using DMRNR in the initial phase; 2) it maintains the data model of road networks by monitoring the real-time change information; and 3) the results are generated according to the submitted query with the updated data model and the latest state of moving objects The merit of the proposed algorithm lies in that it queries the nearest neighbors by taking the movements of the moving object and the variety of the road networks into consideration Extensive experiments are conducted and the experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement of the proposed method when compared with conventional solutions.

When a certain class of switches is preserved under 2-stage interconnection, recursive application of 2-stage interconnection then builds indefinitely large switches in this class ftom atomic ones. The present paper studies switches that are not preserved under 2-stage interconnection but are yet constructible ftom atomic elements through recursive 2-stage interconnection. The principle is "mixed preservation " based on the following two properties: First, the 2-stage interconnection network constructs a class-A switch when switches at nodes on one stage belong to class A and switches at nodes on the other stage belong to class B; second, class-B switches are preserved under 2-stage interconnection. A class of conditionally nonblocking switches for such mixed preservation are identified, which are useful in the recursive construction of distribution networks.

Subsequently, the optimal control problem of decentralized nonlinear discrete-time system is considered with unknown internal subsystem and interconnection dynamics while assuming that the control gain matrix is known. For the near optimal controller development, the direct neural dynamic programming technique is utilized to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation forward-in-time. The decentralized optimal controller design for each subsystem utilizes the critic-actor structure by using NNs. All NN parameters are tuned online. By using Lyapunov techniques it is shown that all subsystems signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) for stabilization of such systems.

These problems usually have a large number of variables to be solved. For example, problems for VLSI design automation require several million variables. Besides, their computational complexity is often intractable due to NP-hardness. Neural networks have provided elegant solutions as approximation algorithms to these hard problems due to their natural parallelism and their affinity to hardware realization. Particularly, binary neural networks have great potential to conform to current digital VLSI design technology, because any state and parameter in binary neural networks are expressed in a discrete fashion. This paper presents our studies on binary neural networks to the N-queens problem, and the three different approaches to VLSI implementations focusing on the efficient realization of the synaptic connection networks. Reconfigurable devices such as CPLDs and FPGAs contribute the realization of a scalable architecture with the ultra highs speed of computation.

Upon obtaining the data, this study compares the predictive performance of two machine-learning models for discrete choice analysis and makes recommendations for model selection. Using concepts from blocked fractional factorial designs, a locally optimal DCE was created for the choice sets. This contrasts with alternative ways that, in practice, could be more difficult, especially when there is a large number of attributes. The call rate, data speed, customer service, premiums, and network coverage were the features considered. A total of 180 respondents were chosen from the student population using a two-stage sample approach, and data were gathered through face-to-face interviews. In this study, two deep-learning models are examined to analyze the data, which are the artificial neural network (ANN) and the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used to assess the model fitness, while accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score were used to compare the models' performance. The results showed that XGBoost performs better compared to ANN in model fitness and prediction. Thus, the use of the XGBoost deep-learning model in choice preference modeling is therefore encouraged.

Mixture designs to investigate the role of alkali and alkaline earth cations on composition-structure-property relationships in ternary borate glass networks	JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS												Sixteen borate glass compositions, modified with K2O and SrO, were established using a design of mixtures approach and were subjected to chemical and physical characterization (B-11 MAS NMR, density, and glass transition temperature (T-g)). The analysis intended to establish the influence of K2O and SrO on the composition structure-property relationships for borate glass networks. The effects of gamma-radiation on the glass networks were also examined to determine the impact that sterilization may have on the glass properties. Structural analysis showed that both K2O and SrO influenced the fraction of three-and four-fold coordinated boron groups independent of the cation. Thermal analysis of the glasses revealed that SrO significantly increases the glass transition temperature while both SrO and K2O have comparable impacts on glass stability. These data suggest that Sr2+ cations cross-link the networks. Contrastingly, K+ appears to stabilize B4 structures. All sixteen compositions retained their chemical and physical characteristics following sterilization.																			0022-3093	1873-4812				OCT 1	2021	569								120982	10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.120982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.120982		JUN 2021											WOS:000674487200008

This article, by extending the method, proposes a time-dependent concentration interval analysis (CIA) method to solve the problems associated with the synthesis of discontinuous or batch water-using systems involving both non-mass-transfer-based and mass-transfer-based operation. This method can effectively identify the possibility of water reuse and the amount of water reused under time constraints for minimizing the consumption of freshwater in single or repeated batch/discontinuous water-using systems. Moreover, on the basis of the heuristic method adapted from concentration interval analysis method for the continuous process network design, the network design for the discontinuous or batch process can be obtained through the designs for every time interval. Case study illustrates that the method presented in this article can simultaneously minimize the freshwater consumption in single or repeated batch/discontinuous water system and can determine a preferable storage tank capacity for some problems.

[image omitted]2 optimal semistable stabilisation for linear discrete-time dynamical systems with applications to network consensus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL												In this article, we develop H2 semistability theory for linear discrete-time dynamical systems. Using this theory, we design H2 optimal semistable controllers for linear dynamical systems. Unlike the standard H2 optimal control problem, a complicating feature of the H2 optimal semistable stabilisation problem is that the closed-loop Lyapunov equation guaranteeing semistability can admit multiple solutions. An interesting feature of the proposed approach, however, is that a least squares solution over all possible semistabilising solutions corresponds to the H2 optimal solution. It is shown that this least squares solution can be characterised by a linear matrix inequality minimisation problem. Finally, the proposed framework is used to develop H2 optimal semistable controllers for addressing the consensus control problem in networks of dynamic agents.																			0020-7179	1366-5820					2009	82	3					456	469	PII 904365013	10.1080/00207170802126864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207170802126864													WOS:000263650800005
J	Zhao, YF; Shen, JH; Chen, DY				Zhao, Yanfeng; Shen, Jihong; Chen, Dongyan			Design of Nonfragile State Estimator for Discrete-Time Genetic Regulatory Networks Subject to Randomly Occurring Uncertainties and Time-Varying Delays	COMPLEXITY												We deal with the design problem of nonfragile state estimator for discrete-time genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) with time-varying delays and randomly occurring uncertainties. In particular, the norm-bounded uncertainties enter into the GRNs in random ways in order to reflect the characteristic of the modelling errors, and the so-called randomly occurring uncertainties are characterized by certain mutually independent random variables obeying the Bernoulli distribution. The focus of the paper is on developing a new nonfragile state estimation method to estimate the concentrations of the mRNA and the protein for considered uncertain delayed GRNs, where the randomly occurring estimator gain perturbations are allowed. By constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a delay-dependent criterion is obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by properly using the discrete-time Wirtinger-based inequality and reciprocally convex combination approach as well as the free-weighting matrix method. It is shown that the proposed method ensures that the estimation error dynamics is globally asymptotically stable and the desired estimator parameter is designed via the solutions to certain LMIs. Finally, we provide two numerical examples to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed estimation results.					yanfeng, zhao/JOK-5440-2023	Yanfeng, Zhao/0000-0001-6537-0502													1076-2787	1099-0526					2017									4573039	10.1155/2017/4573039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/4573039													WOS:000412160200001

A mechanochemically assisted oxidative coupling polymerization strategy was used to create a new family of soluble nanoporous polymer networks. The solid-state ball-milling method affords inherent molecular weight control over polymer growth and therefore provides unexpected solubility for the resulting nanoporous frameworks.

Artificial neural network for predicting creep and shrinkage of high performance concrete	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED CONCRETE TECHNOLOGY												Concrete undergoes time-dependent deformations that must be considered in the design of reinforced/prestressed high-performance concrete (HPC) bridge girders. In this research, experiments on the creep and shrinkage properties of a HPC mix were conducted for 500 days. The test results obtained from this research were compared to different models to determine which model was the better one. The CEB-90 model was found better in predicting time-dependent strains and deformations for the above HPC mix. However, in a far zone, some deviation was observed, and to get a better model, the experimental data base was used along with the CEB-90 model database to train the neural network. The developed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model will serve as a more rational as well as computationally efficient model in predicting creep coefficient and shrinkage strain.

A practical transmission protocol is proposed to execute channel estimation and passive beamforming successively. To minimize the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation, we first formulate an optimization problem for designing the IRS reflection pattern in the training phase under the constraints of unit-modulus, discrete phase, and full rank. This problem, however, is NPhard and thus difficult to solve in general. As such, we propose a low-complexity yet efficient method to solve it sub-optimally, by constructing a near-orthogonal reflection pattern based on either discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-matrix quantization or Hadamard-matrix truncation. Based on the estimated channel, we then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable rate by designing the discrete-phase passive beamforming at the IRS with the training overhead and channel estimation error taken into account. To reduce the computational complexity of exhaustive search, we further propose a low-complexity successive refinement algorithm with a properly-designed initialization to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results are presented to show the significant rate improvement of our proposed IRS training reflection pattern and passive beamforming designs as compared to other benchmark schemes.

Researchers have proposed various intrusion detection techniques by integrating different machine learning algorithms, but these techniques commonly share a high false-positive rate problem. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach of integrating computational analysis with visual analytics to detect network intrusions. For the computational analysis, both Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied to analyze network traffic data. First, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is utilized as the MRA approach to extract features from the network traffic data. After determining statistically significant features from a statistical validation, PCA is applied to transform the extracted features for identifying principal components in eigenspace. Lastly, a visual analytics tool is designed to help the user conduct an interactive visual analysis on detected network intrusions by initiating interactive visual validation and verification. We found that our approach is useful to detect the network intrusions as well as to understand their patterns.

With the effectiveness verifications of the protein-protein network in yeast and the U.S.A. airline routing map, we find that in a suitable mixing weight, the compromised selective pinning strategy achieves almost the same pinning efficiency as that of the BC-based pinning strategy, which however does not completely depend on the global connectivity information. These findings are very important to shed lights to the design of a new effective selective pinning strategy in the situations of real-time networking control systems.					li, xiang/GWM-6319-2022; Li, Xiang/AAB-4134-2020	Li, Xiang/0000-0002-6482-2535													2161-2927		978-7-89463-104-6				2010							4656	4660																WOS:000397331304144

The NCS is modeled as a sampled-data system which involves a continuous plant, a digital controller, an event-driven holder and network channels. In this model, two types of packet dropouts in the sensor-to-controller (S/C) side and controller-to-actuator (C/A) side are both considered, and are described by two mutually independent stochastic variables satisfying the Bernoulli binary distribution. By applying an input/output delay approach, the sampled-data NCS is transformed into a continuous time-delay system with stochastic parameters. An observer-based control scheme is designed such that the closed-loop NCS is stochastically exponentially mean-square stable and the prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level is also achieved. The controller design problem is transformed into a feasibility problem for a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

In this article, we study a highly applicable form of the SND, referred to as the multi-module SND (MM-SND), in which transmission capacities on edges can be sum of integer multiples of differently sized capacity modules. We formulate MM-SND as mixed integer programs, where existing structures of the network (p-cycles) are used to protect edge failures. We derive valid inequalities for MM-SND through polyhedral analysis and show that the valid inequalities previously developed in the literature for the single-module SND are special cases of these inequalities. Furthermore, we show that these inequalities define facets for the convex hull of MM-SND in many cases. Our computational results show that these inequalities are very effective in solving MM-SND problem instances.																			0028-3045	1097-0037				MAR	2023	81	2					155	176		10.1002/net.22122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/net.22122		AUG 2022											WOS:000843630900001

Dense prediction tasks (object detection and image segmentation), as fundamental tasks in the field of computer vision, the CNN models currently designed for them rely mainly on the construction of multi-scale information. Pooling layer, as a low-cost down-sampling component for building such models, effectively saves the number of model parameters and computational effort. The existing mainstream pooling methods not only lose a lot of effective feature information during down-sampling, but also do not perform multi-scale fusion of feature information during down-sampling, which greatly affects the final performance of the network. To this end, we propose an adaptive mixed pooling method. It is designed to allow the network to achieve adaptive mixing of pooling methods by learning the relevant weight parameters, so that the network can retain as much valid feature information as possible when down-sampling. Further, we construct a multi-scale adaptive mixed pooling method that can ensure that the network performs adaptive fusion of multi-scale feature information when down-sampling. We have conducted related experiments in yolo series object detection network as well as UNet and UNeXt image segmentation networks, and the results show the superiority of our method compared to other mainstream pooling methods for performance and parametric balance in dense prediction tasks.

J	Zhao, ZY; Tang, ZX; Wu, YQ; Zhang, B				Zhao, Ziyang; Tang, Zongxi; Wu, Yunqiu; Zhang, Biao			Broadband High Efficiency Power Amplifier Design Using Continuous Class F Mode	MICROWAVE JOURNAL												A novel approach for the design of broadband high efficiency power amplifiers (BHPA) simplifies the process of synthesizing a wideband output matching network by realizing harmonic tuning and fundamental matching separately. First, the second and third harmonic load impedances are calculated based on the theory of the continuous class F mode. Then, a novel wideband harmonic suppression network is obtained by using microstrip radial stubs (MRS) that is unaffected by the adjacent fundamental matching circuit. A power amplifier (PA) designed with a 10 W Wolfspeed GaN HEMT device achieves a fractional bandwidth of 30.4 percent from 1.95 to 2.65 GHz, with 60.9 to 81.6 percent drain efficiency (DE), 60 to 79.9 percent power added efficiency (PAE) and 39.7 to 41.7 dBm output power across the operating band. As shown through the design process, simulation and measured results, this approach makes the design of the harmonic load network easier and more accurate compared to existing methods, for which it is difficult to simultaneously control the fundamental and harmonic impedances, especially at higher frequencies. This method can be widely applied to BHPA design for modern wireless communication systems.																			0192-6225					MAY	2017	60	5					132	146																WOS:000401787000018
J	Ethne,; Amatucci, FM; Coleman, S				Swartz, Ethne; Amatucci, Frances M.; Coleman, Susan			Using a multiple method and mixed mode approach to examine women entrepreneur negotiating styles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENDER AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP												Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore an optimal research design for research on women entrepreneurs involved in negotiating term sheets for private equity capital. This research explores new ways for researchers to connect with such current "invisibles" through the use of a mixed method and mixed mode research design to expand sampling options and secure respondent participation. The authors discuss existing data sets that have been used as secondary sources for data on financing of companies and consider their inadequacy for research questions about process issues in negotiation. The authors present process-related findings regarding the efficacy of the research design. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews research on research methodology, incorporating a discussion of practices outside of the entrepreneurship discipline to discover effective practices for identifying respondents and data not currently captured in entrepreneurship data sources. The respondents were found through social media sites, angel networks, University networks and via identification through a proprietary financial intelligence database. Findings - An optimal research design to identify women business owners of growth-oriented firms who have negotiated private equity should consider mixed methods designs and mixed modes, including the use of digital networks that signal to potential respondents that research is being done. Research limitations/implications - Although the authors developed the multi-method, mixed mode (MMMM) research design, the sample size is still relatively small. This raises concerns about generalizability to the larger population and limits statistical analysis more suitable with larger data sets. However, the MMMM research design has enabled the authors to reach a difficult target sample. It has proven effective, although a longer time frame would have been helpful. Research limitations/implications - All of the large scale databases in entrepreneurship have limitations in providing optimal sampling frames for process-related research. The present research study was able to use conventional networks, social media sites and angel networks to connect with women business owners who have raised private equity, but who lack visibility in current data sets. The study shows that through the use of multiple methods, women entrepreneurs can be researched and some will share their experiences about process issues. The sample size was small and the quantitative data cannot be generalized. However, the methodology works and allows researchers to explore experiences that are not captured in existing data sets. Social implications - Entrepreneurship researchers can connect with "invisibles" by becoming more "social" and using social media sites that are used by women entrepreneurs. Researchers may not have immediate access to women entrepreneurs through these means, but rather they need to develop interpersonal contacts, build a social presence and trust to recruit respondents to complete online questionnaire studies about substantive topics such as negotiating term sheets for equity investments in their companies. Originality/value - This paper summarizes the "research on research methodologies" in entrepreneurship, reviews secondary data sources and discusses their limitations for specific types of research questions. A review of the value of MMMM research designs and best practices in online survey research outside of entrepreneurship provides insights into the incorporation of digital tools in other disciplines.																			1756-6266	1756-6274					2016	8	1					48	68		10.1108/IJGE-09-2013-0060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJGE-09-2013-0060													WOS:000373959200003

However, increases in bandwidth have been accompanied by increases in power consumption, and despite sustained system design efforts to address power demand, significant technological challenges remain that threaten to slow future bandwidth growth. In this paper we describe the power and associated heat management challenges in today's routers. We advocate a broad approach to addressing this problem that includes making power-awareness a primary objective in the design and configuration of networks, and in the design and implementation of network protocols. We support our arguments by providing a case study of power demands of two standard router platforms that enables us to create a generic model for router power consumption. We apply this model in a set of target network configurations and use mixed integer optimization techniques to investigate power consumption, performance and robustness in static network design and in dynamic routing. Our results indicate the potential for significant power savings in operational networks by including power-awareness.																			0743-166X		978-1-4244-2025-4				2008							1130	+		10.1109/infocom.2008.93	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/infocom.2008.93													WOS:000259411701015

In this paper, we show that these two types of network design should be considered simultaneously to achieve a better evacuation performance. A mixed integer linear program is proposed, in which an earliest arrival flow model is employed to describe the underlying system optimum evacuation traffic flow pattern. The embedded earliest arrival flow model, built upon a node-link network representation, helps to maintain a small problem size. To address the computational difficulty, an accelerated Benders decomposition algorithm is developed to leverage the separable structure of the proposed model. Numerical experiments are used to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm. The results illustrate that the integrated consideration of shelter assignment and contraflow operations in evacuation planning facilitates the effective usage of the evacuation network capacity to further reduce the total system travel time in emergency evacuation.

J	Zhang, YN; Mu, BG; Zheng, HC				Zhang, Yunong; Mu, Bingguo; Zheng, Huicheng			Link Between and Comparison and Combination of Zhang Neural Network and Quasi-Newton BFGS Method for Time-Varying Quadratic Minimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS												Since 2001, a novel type of recurrent neural network called Zhang neural network (ZNN) has been proposed, investigated, and exploited for solving online time-varying problems in a variety of scientific and engineering fields. In this paper, three discrete-time ZNN models are first proposed to solve the problem of time-varying quadratic minimization (TVQM). Such discrete-time ZNN models exploit methodologically the time derivatives of time-varying coefficients and the inverse of the time-varying coefficient matrix. To eliminate explicit matrix-inversion operation, the quasi-Newton BFGS method is introduced, which approximates effectively the inverse of the Hessian matrix; thus, three discrete-time ZNN models combined with the quasi-Newton BFGS method (named ZNN-BFGS) are proposed and investigated for TVQM. In addition, according to the criterion of whether the time-derivative information of time-varying coefficients is explicitly known/ used or not, these proposed discrete-time models are classified into three categories: 1) models with time-derivative information known (i.e., ZNN-K and ZNN-BFGS-K models), 2) models with time-derivative information unknown (i.e., ZNN-U and ZNN-BFGS-U models), and 3) simplified models without using time-derivative information (i.e., ZNN-S and ZNN-BFGS-S models). The well-known gradient-based neural network is also developed to handle TVQM for comparison with the proposed ZNN and ZNN-BFGS models. Illustrative examples are provided and analyzed to substantiate the efficacy of these proposed models for TVQM.

Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) have been designed to encourage the establishment of water exchange networks between enterprises in order to minimize freshwater consumption and wastewater discharge by maximizing wastewater reuse. In this paper, a mathematical programming model for designing and optimizing industrial water networks in EIPs is studied by formulating and solving Single-Leader-Multi-Follower (SLMF) game problems. Enterprises (followers) aim to minimize their operating costs by reusing wastewater from other enterprises, while the designer (leader) aims to minimize the consumption of natural resources within the ecopark. Moreover, when participating in the ecopark, enterprises can control all their input fluxes and the designer guarantees a minimal relative improvement in comparison with the stand-alone operation of each enterprise. The SLMF game is transformed into a single mixed-integer optimization problem. The obtained results are compared with the results of the blind-input model (Salas et al., 2020).

Cross-docking is a practical strategy in distribution cycle which has significantly attracted the attention of experts and industrialists in different areas. In this paper, the problem of designing a multi-echelon reverse logistics network with applying cross-docking centers is presented-as the first attempt to propose the new approach of using cross-docking centers in reverse logistics network. In this regard, a mixed-integer linear programming is utilized to model the problem for the goals of increasing shipment rate, decreasing fixed, variable costs and better management of returned products. Finally, the validation and sensitivity analysis are done by using the GAMS software. Considered the above requirements, the model facilitates objective-oriented reverse logistic performance.

The communication graph has negative weights to represent antagonistic interaction among agents. Two kinds of distributed variable impulsive protocols are designed for case with leader and leaderless. Compared with existing fixed-time impulsive protocols, the action instant of variable impulsive protocol is in a time window and not fixed, which is more suitable for practical application. By employing Lyapunov function approach and comparison system theorem, the results reveal that the bipartite leaderless consensus and bipartite tracking consensus can be achieved. Meanwhile, the rate of bipartite consensus possess the characteristic of exponential, if some conditions are met. Finally, the effectiveness of the consensus analysis is verified by three simulation examples.

The optimization model defines the strategic network design, and then determines its tactical distribution plan. A multimodal transportation network is considered in which road, maritime, rail, and pipeline resources may be chosen. The network structure is represented through a graph modeling approach, so the diverse network operations, for example, the exchange of products between warehouses, may be readily incorporated into the optimization model. A case study based on the Brazilian oil industry is explored and analyzed to check and demonstrate the adequacy of the MILP model to solve a real-world problem.

J	Liu, ZH; Shi, J; Liu, ZY				Liu, Zhi-Hua; Shi, Jing; Liu, Zhi-Yong			Design of distributed wastewater treatment systems with multiple contaminants	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												In design of a distributed wastewater treatment system, wastewater degradation caused by unreasoning stream-mixing will increase the total treatment flowrate, and this will often increase treatment cost. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce unreasoning stream-mixing as much as possible in the design procedure. This paper proposes a new method to reduce unreasoning stream-mixing in the design of distributed wastewater treatment networks. The design procedure includes following steps: (1) the main function of each treatment unit is identified: (2) the minimum treatment amount of each unit for its main contaminant, without considering other contaminants, is obtained with pinch method; (3) for the systems with many treatment units, a three-unit-group is selected and the precedence order of the units in the group is determined with the heuristic rules proposed in this paper. The above procedure will continue till the number of the units left is equal to or less than three. Some literature examples are investigated, and the results obtained in this work are compared to that obtained in the literature. It is shown that the design method proposed is simple and effective.

We study relevant theoretical and practical aspects of transmission expansion planning, set as a bilinear programming problem with mixed 0-1 variables. We show that the problem is NP-hard and that, unlike the so-called Network Design Problem, a transmission network may become more efficient after cutting-off some of its circuits. For this reason, we introduce a new model that, rather than just adding capacity to the existing network, also allows for the network to be re-designed when it is expanded. We then turn into different reformulations of the problem, that replace the bilinear constraints by using a "big-M" approach. We show that computing the minimal values for the "big-M" coefficients involves finding the shortest and longest paths between two buses. We assess our theoretical results by making a thorough computational study on real electrical networks. The comparison of various models and reformulations shows that our new model, allowing for re-design, can lead to sensible cost reductions.

In this study, we formulate the BRCP as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP). Simulations are conducted, in which the MISOCP model is applied to a major bus station in Hong Kong based on the network of actual bus routes. Experiments are tested for large size instances under different scenarios. Results show that the complexity of the BRCP is highly dependent on the overlapping degree of bus networks, while other factors, including the number of bus routes, destinations, and boarding locations have a joint effect; the influence is instance-specific based on different overlapping topologies of bus route networks.

Adaptive Neural Sliding Mode Control in Discrete Time for a SCARA Robot Arm	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS												This work presents a neuro-adaptive control method in sliding mode control designed in discrete time for SCARA robot arm. The proposed control structure is based on neuro-adaptive sliding mode control to adjust dynamics variations of the SCARA robot. The sliding control is included to ensure that the discrete-time neural control can improve the stable closed loop system to be immune to the parameters variations. The proposed technique simultaneously ensures the stability of the adaptation of neural networks and can obtain adequate control when the robot's parameters are inexactly or unknown. This adaptive neural system was applied on a SCARA type robot arm where the trajectory tracking error converges to zero.

This information was used to provide the input data for generating a series of discrete fracture networks (DFN) models. The generated DFN models were subsequently used to investigate the creation of rock wedges along the drifts that may impact the stability of the excavations. The impact of the choice of employed DFN model on the analysis was investigated with reference to the stability of excavations. A series of parametric analyses demonstrated the sensitivity of the model to variations in the properties of the structural regime. The benefits of using stochastic modelling to capture the inherent variability are reviewed.						grenon, martin/0000-0003-3919-9275													0371-7844	1743-2863					2017	126	1					22	33		10.1080/14749009.2016.1199296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14749009.2016.1199296													WOS:000396546100003

The paper derives new results for the relative degrees of such systems using the implicit function theory to solve the issue of implicit dependence on system input in the process of feedback linearization. Such implicit input dependence is typically caused by time-advance operation for discrete-time systems, different from their continunous-time counterparts under time-differentiation operation leading to explicit input dependence. New relative degree formulations are employed to achieve desired system reparametrization for adaptive control. It develops an adaptive control scheme with analysis for relative degree one systems and an adaptive control design for relative degree two systems with simulation results to show desired system performance and discussion on some technical issues.					yan, wang/JRW-9981-2023; Zhang, Y J/HLG-1022-2023; chen, mou/KOC-4929-2024														0743-1546		978-1-5090-1837-6				2016							3389	3394																WOS:000400048103092

The construction method is based on a nonlinear map approach, the orbits of which represent stationary solutions of the DNLS. The single (stationary) soliton states of the DNLS lattice are associated with single-pulse homoclinic and heteroclinic connections. It is demonstrated that the external potential can be adopted to excite multiple solitons at arbitrarily chosen locations on the lattice. Furthermore, multiple soliton states having different maximal amplitudes are excited. Finally, we use the orbits of the stationary map as initial conditions to design stationary localized multipulse solutions in the dynamics of the (time-dependent) discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation and discuss their linear stability.																			1063-651X					FEB	1998	57	2	B				2371	2376		10.1103/PhysRevE.57.2371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.57.2371													WOS:000072116100058

The main objective is to determine the minimum mean capacity required to enable stabilization. The basic idea of our method is to consider stabilization from the viewpoint of a supply/demand balance. Specifically, for communication resources, each system control input is viewed as the demand side, while the channel is viewed as the supply side, and the supply resource of the channel is characterized by the mean square capacity of each channel. Stabilization of the networked control system requires the balance of supply and demand. Based on whether the channel resources are configurable, two different methods for balancing the supply and the demand are discussed. If the channel resources are configurable, the demand side can be satisfied by adjusting the supply side (channel resources); otherwise, the demand side (a certain transceiver design mechanism) can be adjusted to meet the requirements of the supplier. For both cases, sufficient and necessary conditions for stabilizing discrete-time networked control systems are given.

Our goal is to select the optimum numbers, locations and capacities of plants and warehouses to open so that all customer demand is satisfied at minimum total costs of the distribution network (including transportation and production costs). Unlike most of past research, our study allows for multiple levels of capacities available to the warehouses and plants. We developed a mixed integer programming model for the problem and solved it by a heuristic procedure which contains 2 sub-procedures. We used harmony-search meta-heuristic as the main procedure and linear programming to solve a transshipment problem as a subroutine at any iteration of the main procedure.

However, many of these networks usually perform such operations in a predefined way and, thus, lack in their flexibility. To overcome this problem, ring networks are used, since they allow to execute multiple operations in a row. But while several concepts and also prototypical implementations exist that realize such ring networks, the design process for them is still mainly conducted manually thus far. This is a severe drawback since various aspects, such as the dimensions of the channels, the effects of droplets, the used fluids, the volumetric flow rates inside the channels, etc., have to be considered for this purpose. In this article, we propose design automation methods which address this problem. The proposed solution will automatically generate a proper design as well as correspondingly needed droplet sequences. A case study demonstrates the applicability of the resulting methods and simulations confirms the validity of the proposed approach.

Numerical analysis is carried out by solving three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations using the shear stress transport turbulence model. A validation of numerical results is conducted by comparison with experimental data for the head, power, and efficiency. An optimization process based on a radial basis neural network model is performed with four design variables that define the straight vane length ratio, the diffusion area ratio, the angle at the diffuser vane tip, and the distance ratio between the impeller blade trailing edge and the diffuser vane leading edge. Efficiency as a hydrodynamic performance parameter is selected as the objective function for optimization. The objective function is numerically assessed at design points selected by Latin hypercube sampling in the design space. The optimization yielded a maximum increase in efficiency of 9.75% at the design flow coefficient compared to a reference design. The performance curve for efficiency was also enhanced in the high flow rate region. Detailed internal flow fields between the reference and optimum designs are analyzed and discussed.

This paper thus presents a nonlinear integer model for determining a facilities design strategy that embodies the economic tradeoffs encompassed in a competitive strategy: minimizing cost and maximizing market share. The integrated location and service mix model determines the number, location and service offerings of facilities that maximize profitability in a two-level hierarchical referral delivery network where an organization's market share is represented by a multiplicative competitive interaction model. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed integrated model, a series of problems is solved by an interchange heuristic and compared to the solutions derived by a simpler approach that ignores market competition.																			0038-0121					DEC	1993	27	4					289	302		10.1016/0038-0121(93)90021-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0121(93)90021-A													WOS:A1993MP71500004

Although many methods are available in the literature, they may be inadequate for reliable network calibration. This paper proposes a new method for the optimal collocation of monitoring points using a shortest path based approach. The monitoring points are identified by minimizing the sum of node distances from the closest sensor-node. Node distances were taken to be a weighted sum of the dimensionless arc length and the absolute head loss along arc. To ensure robustness with respect to the presence of outliers among pipe lengths and/or pressure drops, adequate reference measures were chosen for normalization. The optimization problem was solved using Mixed Integer Programming and a variant of the K-Means algorithm. Alternative formulations considering different path blending and distance norms were also analyzed. Numerical experiments carried out on both theoretical and real water distribution networks showed the reliability of the proposed approach and a greater effectiveness compared to similar methods available in the literature.

A novel disjunctive model is first developed to determine an optimal water allocation network (WAN) where water and energy are integrated in one step. Based on the optimal WAN, a detailed heat exchanger network (HEN) to satisfy the utility target is then synthesized. Although the final network structure is obtained through two steps, the targets of freshwater and utility are optimized simultaneously. The proposed method has specific advantages. First of all, it can capture a tradeoff among freshwater usage, utility consumption, and direct heat transfer by nonisothermal mixing. Second, it can greatly reduce the complexity of subsequent HEN design. Finally, it is effective for simultaneous water and energy integration in large-scale WAHEN systems. The advantages and applicability of this new method are illustrated by three examples from literature.

These expressions yield the important figures-of-merit gain, drain efficiency, and power-added efficiency (PAE)I. Using standard device parameters, design optimization for maximum PAE follows directly from the analysis and applies to both integrated and discrete transistor implementations, For integrated designs, the optimal FET aspect ratio can be determined, given the design variables of the Class-E output network (output power, frequency, supply voltage, and loaded-Q of the output resonator). In a discrete transistor application, the Class-E network can be optimized for one of the design variables, The detrimental effects of the device parasitics on the amplifier's performance at UHF and microwave frequencies are accounted for in the model and explained in this paper.

For a given fiber network and a given set of client demands, the minimum cost network design is the task of assigning routing paths and wavelengths for a minimum cost set of lightpaths able to groom all client demands. The variant of the optical network design problem addressed in this paper considers a transparent optical network, single hop grooming, client demands of a single interface type, and lightpaths of two line rates. We discuss two slightly different mixed integer linear programming models that define the network design problem combining grooming, routing, and wavelength assignment. Then, we propose a parameters increase rule and three types of additional constraints that, when applied to the previous models, make their linear relaxation solutions closer to the integer solutions. Finally, we use the resulting models to derive a hybrid heuristic method, which combines a relax-and-fix approach with an integer linear programming-based local search approach. We present the computational results showing that the proposed heuristic method is able to find solutions with cost values very close to the optimal ones for a real nationwide network and considering a realistic fiber link capacity of 80 wavelengths. Moreover, when compared with other approaches used in the problem variants close to the one addressed here, our heuristic is shown to compute solutions, on average, with better cost values and/or in shorter runtimes.					de Sousa, Amaro/J-3571-2016; Doostmohammadi/AAR-6932-2020; Agra, Agostinho/H-7019-2012	Doostmohammadi/0000-0002-6865-8058; Agra, Agostinho/0000-0002-4672-6099													1063-6692	1558-2566				DEC	2016	24	6					3702	3713		10.1109/TNET.2016.2544760	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2016.2544760													WOS:000391727900035

Network Models for Multiobjective Discrete Optimization	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING												This paper provides a novel framework for solving multiobjective discrete optimization problems with an arbitrary number of objectives. Our framework represents these problems as network models, in that enumerating the Pareto frontier amounts to solving a multicriteria shortest-path problem in an auxiliary network. We design techniques for exploiting network models in order to accelerate the identification of the Pareto frontier, most notably a number of operations to simplify the network by removing nodes and arcs while preserving the set of nondominated solutions. We show that the proposed framework yields orders-of-magnitude performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art algorithms on five problem classes containing both linear and nonlinear objective functions. Summary of Contribution: Multiobjective optimization has a long history of research with applications in several domains. Our paper provides an alternative modeling and solution approach for multiobjective discrete optimization problems by leveraging graphical structures. Specifically, we encode the decision space of a problem as a layered network and propose graph reduction operators to preserve only solutions whose image are part of the Pareto frontier. The nondominated solutions can then be extracted through shortest-path algorithms on such a network. Numerical results comparing our method with state-of-the-art approaches on several problem classes, including the knapsack, set covering, and the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), suggest orders-of-magnitude runtime speed-ups for exactly enumerating the Pareto frontier, especially when the number of functions						Cardonha, Carlos/0000-0002-1439-5205; Bodur, Merve/0000-0002-9276-3755													1091-9856	1526-5528				MAR-APR	2022	34	2					990	1005		10.1287/ijoc.2021.1066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2021.1066		NOV 2021											WOS:000731984900001

The results provide better design stage decisions relating to location, sizing and operation of installations and links as well as tactical decisions for various stage time-dependent transportation volumes and inventory levels. Real world examples based on the PSC network in Portugal are used to test the model's response to different situations.

In this paper, we propose a novel mixed-mode implementation of the weight update in particle PHD filter, which outperforms its counterpart digital-form implementation in terms of power dissipation and hardware resource consumption. In specific, the mixed-mode implementation uses multiple-input translinear element (MITE) networks to realize the likelihood function of weight update in the analog domain. T he MITE networks, which are operated in subthreshold region, contribute to the low-power implementation of the particle PHD filters, and can lead to parallel implementation of the weight update with lower hardware cost. Extensive simulations are conducted with circuit models and parameters from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 0.18 mu m CMOS technology library for mixed-mode implementation of weight update, and the results show that the analog errors in this mixed mode implementation are negligible when used to support real-world multi-target tracking.

These delays often occur when the number of patients in the emergency department (ED) exceed the designed capacity such that ED cannot accept an incoming patient immediately, thereby forcing the ambulance and crew to wait with the patient until a bed becomes available. In this paper, we analyze and optimize the emergency medical services network, including ambulance stations and EDs. The objective is to reduce ambulance offload delays and lessen the congestion of EDs. To this end, we first build a continuous-time Markov chain to characterize this network analytically. Next, from the perspectives of both ambulance stations and EDs, we develop resource configuration and optimization models for this network. We investigate the reasons for ED overcapacity and ambulance offload delays. Finally, we design an effective approach to reconfigure the resources in the emergency medical services network, leading to a new and better equilibrium.					liu, yuxin/GRY-3592-2022; LIU, YU/HTR-1607-2023	Liu, Weiliang/0000-0003-0564-3315													1545-5955	1558-3783				OCT	2022	19	4					3520	3535		10.1109/TASE.2021.3125327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2021.3125327		NOV 2021											WOS:000732273500001

Due to the existence of nonidentical uncertainties, the multiagent system studied in this paper is essentially heterogeneous, and the event-triggered consensus problem of which is much more challenging than that of homogeneous linear networks in the existing works. We propose a static nonsmooth event-triggered protocol that includes a nonlinear term to ensure that consensus is achieved and the Zeno behavior is excluded. To avoid the undesirable chattering effect caused by the nonsmooth protocol, we design a static continuous event-based protocol, which can guarantee that the consensus error is ultimately bounded and the upper bound of the consensus error can be made satisfactorily small by choosing properly the design parameters. We also design a continuous adaptive event-triggered protocol that includes time-varying weights into both the control law and the triggering function. Contrary to the event-triggered protocols in the previous related works, the adaptive event-based protocol is fully distributed and scalable, whose design does not require any global information of the network graph. Besides, all the event-triggered protocols in this paper do not need continuous communications among neighboring agents in either control laws' updating or triggering conditions' monitoring.

In contrast to traditional RL-based control methods, we proposed an ET output feedback controller based on the backstepping technique, where the transmission cost can be efficiently conserved. Then, in light of the radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN), various critic NNs are constructed to approximate the critic functions in each step. Furthermore, with the backing of the proposed ET mechanism, a sampled output feedback controller is addressed to guarantee that the tracking errors and all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB).

Unlike classification problems, regression provides a value of output in complex and sophisticated continuous datasets. Though nonlinear models can perform regression better than linear model as Linear Regression(LR), the difficulty to make robust model still remain. In this paper, our purpose is to design training architecture for robust regression. We approach Neural Network known as nonlinear regression to solve limitation of Linear Regression. Additionally, Our architecture uses a new artificial Neural Network(NN) based on adversarial architecture by using the Generator(G) and Discriminator(D). The Discriminator shows the better performance while competing with the Generator and learning regression problem as same time. In evaluation experiments, we compare our proposed model with baseline models including Linear Regression and Neural Network using continuous real world data. We split four datasets into train and test sets as 90:10 and evaluate them by using Mean Squared Error(MSE) function. In summary, our model trained with Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) shows better performance than the baseline models.																			2162-1233		978-1-7281-6758-9				2020							1209	1211																WOS:000692529100295

However, standard Ethernet components require specific modifications and hardware support to provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications. This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new protocol characteristics. Researchers can use the open-source design to verify our results and build upon the framework, which aims to accelerate the development, validation, and adoption of Ethernet-based solutions in real-time applications.

Mode choice behavior is also a core feature in transportation planning models, which are used for analyzing future policies and sustainable plans such as greenhouse gas emissions reduction plans. Specifically, an agent-based model requires an individual level choice behavior, mode choice being one such example. However, traditional utility-based discrete choice models, such as logit models, are limited to aggregated behavior analysis. This paper develops a model employing a deep neural network structure that is applicable to the travel mode choice problem. This paper uses deep learning algorithms to highlight an individual-level mode choice behavior model, which leads us to take into account the inherent characteristics of choice models that all individuals have different choice options, an aspect not considered in the neural network models of the past that have led to poorer performance. Comparative analysis with existing behavior models indicates that the proposed model outperforms traditional discrete choice models in terms of prediction accuracy for both individual and aggregated behavior.

Specifically, we combine the methods of object-orientation with discrete event simulation. This approach has several advantages for constructing and evaluating dynamic social theories. In object-oriented program design, objects combine and integrate the traditional concepts of data structures and algorithms, the building blocks of structured programming. Algorithms associated with objects are called methods or member functions. Constructing social actors as objects involves defining both their data attributes and the methods associated with these attributes. We also treat a social network as a computational object. It has data types of nodes and ties. As an object, the network must also have methods that add and delete nodes and ties. Once a network exists, we can create other data types and method that describe and analyze the network. For example, networks have in-degree and out-degree vectors, and measures of hierarchy. In principle, we can create attributes of networks for all of the structural measures we use to describe networks. We use actor and network objects in a discrete event simulation of a process of formation of dominance structures, exploring several dynamic variations of the underlying theoretical model.																			0378-8733					JAN	1995	17	1					1	26		10.1016/0378-8733(94)00245-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-8733(94)00245-6													WOS:A1995QM57300001

Forgery images generated by various variants of GANs are widely spread on the Internet, which may be damage personal credibility and cause huge property losses. Thus, numerous methods are proposed to detect forgery images, but most of them are designed to detect forgery faces. Therefore, a method to detect forgery images of various scenes is proposed. In this work, central difference convolution and vanilla convolution (CDC-Mix) are mixed after considering the depth and width features of neural networks and analyzing the influence of attention on network performance. Based on CDC-Mix, a separable convolution (SeparableCDC-Mix) is proposed. The proposed method consists of three parts: (1) CDC-Mix and SeparableCDC-Mix are used to extract the gradient information and texture features; (2) CDCM is used to extract the multi-scale information of the image; (3) multi-scale fusion module (MS-Fusion) is used to fuse the multi-scale information from different locations of the network. A large number of experiments have been carried out on several datasets generated by GAN, and the experimental results show that the proposed method has a great improvement compared with the existing advanced methods. We propose SeparableCDC-Mix to learn the image features. In addition, CDCM is introduced to extract the multi-scale information of the image.

The proposed control guarantees the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals and the output tracking error can be made to converge to zero if the system is free of external disturbance. The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated in the simulation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This research work focuses on the design and experimental validation of fault detection techniques in grid-connected solar photovoltaic system operating under Maximum Power Point Tracking mode and subjected to various operating conditions. Purpose. Six fault scenarios are considered in this study including partial shading, open circuit in the photovoltaic array, complete failure of one of the six IGBTs of the inverter and some parametric faults that may appear in controller of the boost converter. Methods. The fault detection technique developed in this work is based on artificial neural networks and uses discrete wavelet transform to extract the features for the identification of the underlying faults. By applying discrete wavelet transform, the time domain inverter output current is decomposed into different frequency bands, and then the root mean square values at each frequency band are used to train the neural network. Results. The proposed fault diagnosis method has been extensively tested on the above faults scenarios and proved to be very effective and extremely accurate under large variations in the irradiance and temperature. Practical significance. The results obtained in the binary numerical system allow it to be used as a machine code and the simulation results has been validated by MATLAB / Simulink software.

At the heart of this system lies a mixed-signal chip, with analog implementations of neurons and synapses and digital transmission of action potentials. Major advantages of this emulation device, which has been explicitly designed as a universal neural network emulator, are its inherent parallelism and high acceleration factor compared to conventional computers. Its configurability allows the realization of almost arbitrary network topologies and the use of widely varied neuronal and synaptic parameters. Fixed-pattern noise inherent to analog circuitry is reduced by calibration routines. An integrated development environment allows neuroscientists to operate the device without any prior knowledge of neuromorphic circuit design. As a showcase for the capabilities of the system, we describe the successful emulation of six different neural networks which cover a broad spectrum of both structure and functionality.

By introducing a data-driven method, a linear-like state equation is designed by utilizing only the input and output (I/O) data without a controlled object model. In the identification step, data-driven adaptive optimization recursive identification (DD-AORI) is exploited to identify the recurrence of time-varying parameters. It is proved that for discrete-time switching networks, estimation errors of all nodes are ultimately bounded when data-driven distributed information-weighted consensus filtering (DD-DICF) is executed. The algorithm combines with the received neighbors and direct or indirect observations for the target node to produce modified gains, resulting in a novel state estimator containing an information interaction mechanism. Subsequently, convergence analysis is performed on the basis of the Lyapunov equation to guarantee the boundedness of DD-DICF estimate error. Simulations verify the performance of the DD-DICF against the theoretical results as well as in comparison with some existing filtering algorithms.

This article examines the campus living wage movement among college students in the United States to identify a networked activist community, its key components and the consequences for its members. A refinement of Howard's network ethnography approach serves as a mixed methods design strategy. A network analysis of hyperlinks revealed the structure of the network, while member interviews were used to discuss the importance of such connections. The findings revealed the importance of ICTs in maintaining a movement through the creation of an unintentional networked community in times of both mobilization and latency. Notably, the resultant network has allowed the campus living wage movement to overcome previous limitations inherit in student protest, and sustained the campus struggle through several student generations.

Focusing on reactors, an accurate determination must account for fundamental differences between operating modes, the size and cost of the respective reactor units, and the potential of utilizing reactor networks to optimize performance. We present a reactor network synthesis framework that simultaneously considers batch and continuous-flow options while accounting for all the aforementioned factors. We introduce a non-dimensional model structure that encompasses all operating mode options, and its discretized representation, the orthogonal collocation on finite elements for reactors (OCFERE). This allows us to formulate a unified economic model and a framework for optimal reactor network synthesis. An illustrative case study is also provided.

J	Wei, HR				Wei, Hairui			Optimal Design of an Integrated Cross-Border Logistics Network for China's Inland Regions	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												As the Belt and Road Initiative is initiated, a strong demand for the development of an inland cross-border logistics occurs. The inland port begins to play an important role in the establishment of the inland cross-border logistics network that functions to link sea and land transportation. From the perspective of the hub connection function of inland ports to the cross-border logistics network, this paper studies the optimal design of the integrated inland cross-border logistics network by a multi-objective mixed-integer program, which is built based on factors, e.g., logistics costs, freight time value, environmental costs, and governmental fiscal subsidy policy for cross-border travels. In addition, the influence of different target preferences, different cost structures, and different financial subsidy policies on the network especially on the proportion of different transportation modes are discussed to provide insights for the decision made to establish an efficient and environmental cross-border logistics network inland in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				MAY	2021	37	3					644	655		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-20-00051	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-20-00051													WOS:000647331500017

In this work, we focus on the global Mittag-Leffler boundedness (GMLB) for discrete-time fractional-order fuzzy delayed complex-valued genetic regulatory networks (DTFFDCVGRNs). To guarantee GMLB of the addressed molecular models, various sufficient criteria, including algebraic conditions and the condition in terms of LMI, are derived based on Caputo fractional difference operator using the Lyapunov function approach and the discrete Laplace transform. In addition, estimates of various global Mittag-Leffler attraction sets (GMLASs) known as convergence balls are provided.

Additional unavoidable effects, such as un-modelled disturbances, discretisation and quantisation, as well as measurement and input noise, make the control of uncertain processes a challenging problem. This paper proposes a discrete-time controller for a class of highly uncertain dynamical systems, whose design is given in two stages: (i) a data-driven model is obtained by means of a fuzzy neural network and a nominal controller for the disturbance-free case is considered; and (ii) a disturbance-observer is formulated to compensate unknown effects. The boundedness of the tracking error signals is analysed and the performance of the proposed scheme is validated throughout experimental results.

The literature suggests that dedicated infrastructure for AVs and enhanced infrastructure for mixed traffic (i.e., AVs on the same lanes with conventional vehicles) are the main alternatives so far. We utilize both alternatives and propose a unified mathematical framework for optimizing road networks for AVs by simultaneous deployment of AV-ready subnetworks for mixed traffic, dedicated AV links, and dedicated AV lanes. We model the problem as a bilevel network design problem where the upper level represents road infrastructure adjustment decisions to deploy these concepts and the lower level includes a network equilibrium model representing the flows as a result of the travelers' response to new network topologies. An efficient heuristic solution method is introduced to solve the formulated problem and find coherent network topologies. Applicability of the model on real road networks is demonstrated using a large-scale case study of the Amsterdam metropolitan region. Our results indicate that for low AV market penetration rates (MPRs), AV-ready subnetworks, which accommodate AVs in mixed traffic, are the most efficient configuration. However, after 30% MPR, dedicated AV lanes prove to be more beneficial. Additionally, road types can dictate the viable deployment plan for certain parts of road networks. These insights can be used to guide planners in developing their strategies regarding road network infrastructure during the transition period to full automation.

J	Musterd, S				Musterd, Sako			Residents' views on social mix: Social mix, social networks and stigmatisation in post-war housing estates in Europe	URBAN STUDIES												Social mix is one of the supposedly promising keywords in today's urban policies. Many players in the field believe that social mix enhances opportunities and the quality of life of urban dwellers. However, there are alternative views of social mix. This paper addresses questions about the relation between-perceived-levels of social mix and the strength of social networks and the reputation of the neighbourhood. In addition, residents' opinions about social mix are investigated taking individual, household and housing situations into account. The main source of information are interview data from the RESTATE project and the paper has a focus on large post-war housing estates in various European cities. It is concluded that there is a wide variety of social mix perceptions in estates built to similar designs in a similar period in different European cities and that these perceptions relate positively, albeit weakly, to the strength of social networks as well as to a good reputation of the estates. However, the context people find themselves in appears to be highly important for the opinions on social mix. People with strong social networks were more in favour of social mix if they perceived themselves living in socially mixed situations, but not if they perceived themselves living in homogeneous environments; people with negative opinions about their neighbours were more negative about social mix in general, but even more so if they had the perception of living in mixed situations themselves, and even more so if they were owner-occupiers. The paper concludes with some implications of these results for urban restructuring policies.

However, for complex AMS circuits with wide specification ranges, creating an ANN model requires a large training dataset. To reduce the required training dataset's volume, we have proposed a circuit-connectivity-inspired ANN (CCI-NN), including multiple sub-ANNs linked according to the actual circuit connections. For validation, we have employed CCI-NN to model a three-stage amplifier and a current-steering digital-to-analog converter. For a certain modeling accuracy, the training dataset requirement is reduced by 3.5x-7.6x.

J	Yeh, IC				Yeh, I-Cheng			Optimization of concrete mix proportioning using a flattened simplex-centroid mixture design and neural networks	ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS												The primary objective of this research was to combine three technologies, namely design of experiments (DOE), artificial neural network (ANN), and mathematical programming (MP), into an integrated methodology for mixing concrete containing SP, fly ash, and slag, consistent with desirable structural grade concrete properties. The function of DOE and ANN is to reduce the number of test mixes and specimens without sacrificing the accuracy of evaluating the effects and the interactions of variations of the components on workability and compressive strength. The function of the MP is to optimize the mixture to lower the cost while keeping the concrete to satisfy required properties. The scope of the research was limited to concrete with compressive strengths 25, 32.5, 40, 47.5, and 55 MPa, and workability 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 cm in slump; therefore, there were 5 x 5 = 25 concrete mixtures. The methodology proved to be applicable for concrete mixes with the above-mentioned wide range of strength and workability. It was also found that (1) the early strength requirement played the dominant role in low and medium strength concrete, while the late strength requirement played the dominant role in high strength concrete, and (2) the workability constraint played a critical role in all concrete except for concrete with low workability.

They also exhibit limited configurability to support diverse quantization schemes on the same circuitry. In this paper, we propose NeuADC-an automated design approach to synthesizing an analog-to-digital (A/D) interface that can approximate the desirable quantization function using a neural network (NN) with a single hidden layer. We leverage the mixed-signal resistive random-access memory (RRAM) crossbar architecture to design a novel dual-path configuration for the implementation of the basic NN operations at the circuit level. We exploit alternative bits encoding scheme to the conventional binary encoding to improve the training accuracy. Our method incorporates nonidealities at the device and circuit level into the training process to ensure NeuADC's robustness against variations of process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT). Results obtained from SPICE simulation based on RRAM and standard 130-nm CMOS technology suggest that not only can NeuADC deliver promising performance compared to the state-of-the-art ADCs and other emerging converter designs across comprehensive design metrics, but it can also intrinsically support multiple configurable quantization schemes using the same hardware substrate, paving ways for future adaptable application-driven signal conversion. Our systematic evaluations on the proposed NeuADC framework also quantify the impacts on the ADC quantization quality from hidden neuron sizes, RRAM resistance imprecision, and PVT variations, and reveal the design tradeoff between speed, power, and area in a NeuADC circuit.

Emergy analysis is a methodology that considers the total, cumulative energy which has been consumed within a system; thus, by minimizing emergy, an environmentally optimal EIP can be designed. This article presents a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for minimizing emergy of an interplant water network in an EIP.

The machines in this system can be in one of four states: operational, in repair, starved, and blocked. Failure and repair times of the machines are exponentially distributed. Previous research on multi-machine failure-prone manufacturing systems (FPMS) has focused on systems consisting of machines in series or in parallel. This paper considers a network of machines with relationship constraints. Additionally, the system under study models work in process for multiple products, intermediate and final buffers and one type of final product. The demand rate for the final commodity is constant and unmet demand is either backlogged or lost. The objective of this control problem is to find the production rates and policies of the different machines so as to minimize the long run average inventory and backlog cost. The applied control policy is the hedging point policy that is determined by factors representing the level of buffer inventory for each machine. Obtaining analytical solutions is generally impossible for such complex systems. To simultaneously control the production rates of the machines we have therefore developed a method based on a combination of stochastic optimal control theory, discrete event simulation, experimental design and automated response surface methodology (RSM). The application of an automated RSM for Network FPMS is another contribution of this paper. The model can be extended easily to systems with age-dependent failure rates, a preventive repair maintenance policy and non-exponentially distributed up and down times.

At this stage human intuition, evolutionary ideas and past successful experience play an important role. At the conceptual stage of the design process the most important decisions, which: will influence the future of projects, are made. Because of the non-algorithmic nature of the process involved at this stage, it is extremely difficult to computerise the activities related to this stage. Artificial neural networks mimic the activities of the human brain. Like human experts, artificial neural networks learn from examples and experience. In this paper the possibility of using artificial neural networks for modelling some of the activities at the conceptual stage of the design process is investigated. An example of the initial design of continuous reinforced concrete flanged beams is reported.																					0-7844-0381-3				1998							631	643																WOS:000083193200075

To circumvent this problem, a multigradient recursive (MGR) reinforcement learning scheme is proposed, which utilizes both the current gradient and the past gradients. As a consequence, the MGR scheme not only eliminates the local optimal problem but also guarantees faster convergence rate than the gradient descent scheme. Moreover, the constraint of actuator input saturation is considered. The closed-loop system stability is developed by using the Lyapunov stability theory, and it is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is further validated via some simulation results.

In this scheme, the fuzzy logic systems are used to proximate unknown functions, and the unknown parameters are adjusted by time-varying dead-zone, which its size is adjusted adaptively with the estimated bounds on the approximation errors. The proposed design scheme guarantees that all the signals in the resulting closed-loop system are bounded, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of this scheme.																			1948-9439		978-1-4244-5182-1				2010							3601	3605		10.1109/CCDC.2010.5498532	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2010.5498532													WOS:000290460302002
J	Lu, JQ; Li, HT; Liu, Y; Li, FF				Lu, Jianquan; Li, Haitao; Liu, Yang; Li, Fangfei			Survey on semi-tensor product method with its applications in logical networks and other finite-valued systems	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												This study presents a detailed survey on recent development of logical networks and its applications, including the background of logical networks, the theory of a new matrix product called semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices, some fundamental works on logical networks, and some current research works. Particularly, some fundamental works on logical networks are presented for the past years, including controllability, stability and stabilisation, synchronisation, disturbance decoupling and so on. Due to the great potential of STP in dealing with logical networks, a surge of attraction from overseas is paid on the study of STP and its applications. Currently, some new research areas are widely studied including pinning control, function perturbations, system decomposition, trajectory control, output tracking issues, symbolic dynamics and so on. The main concern of this study is to present a comprehensive introduction to logical networks and some other applications under the framework of STP of matrices.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				SEP 1	2017	11	13			SI		2040	2047		10.1049/iet-cta.2016.1659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2016.1659													WOS:000407798500002
J	Zhang, WA; Yu, L				Zhang, W. -A.; Yu, L.			New approach to stabilisation of networked control systems with time-varying delays	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												The stabilisation problem is studied for networked control systems (NCSs) with time-varying delays that may be longer than one sampling period. State feedback controllers are considered and the resulting closed-loop NCS is modelled as a discrete-time switched system. Criteria for exponential stability for the closed-loop NCS and design procedures for stabilising controllers are presented by using the approach that combines the average dwell time and asynchronous dynamic system methods. In the cases where the network-induced delays are small most of the time and large delays do not occur frequently, the proposed design method for the NCS may provide less conservative results than some other existing ones. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.					li, fangyu/KCY-0521-2024	li, fangyu/0009-0009-8303-9157													1751-8644	1751-8652				DEC	2008	2	12					1094	1104		10.1049/iet-cta:20070291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta:20070291													WOS:000262162700007

In this paper, we propose and implement a novel Heterogeneous network Integration Support Node design (HISN) and a distributed HISN network architecture for the integration of heterogeneous networks, under which the Session Mobility, Personal Mobility, and Terminal Mobility for mobile users can be maintained through the Session Management mechanism. Thus, the HISN node can serve as an agent for the user to access Internet services independent of underlying communication infrastructure. Our design is transparent to the bearer networks and the deployment of the HISN network does not need to involve the operators of the heterogeneous wireless networks.

While the depressurization may be predicted fairly well using lumped-parameter codes, the prediction of mixing and collection of aerosols requires a local description of transport phenomena. In the present work, modelling of sprays on local instantenous scale is presented and the Design of Experiment (DOE) method is used to assess the influence of boundary conditions on the simulation results. The TOSQAN 101 spray test, which was used for a benchmarking exercise within the EU Severe accident research network of excellence (SARNET), was simulated, and simulation results were compared to experimental data. The modelling approach is based on a Lagrangian description of the dispersed liquid phase (droplets), an Eulerian approach for the description of the continuous gas phase, and a two-way interaction between the phases. The simulations are performed using a combination of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code CFX4.4, which solves the gas transport equations, and of a newly proposed dedicated Lagrangian droplet-tracking code. The intent of the presented work is to assess the modeling of sprays and liquid on the wall in the presented approach with the emphasis on the heat and mass transfer between liquid and gas phase. The simulation-experiment comparison of available global and local variables demonstrates that the proposed approach is suitable for prediction of global variables evolution and of the non-homogenous structure of the atmosphere. The boundary condition steady-state sensitivity study is performed and shows that the global variables are mostly affected by the wall temperature boundary condition.																					978-0-7918-4815-9				2008							255	263																WOS:000260915300031

Previous implementation issues were discussed in [3][4] but this,paper will present recent developments in the circuit design of individual blocks in a reduced KII set as well as a system architecture for the KII network. The coupling coefficients are built into the chip and the shape of the nonlinear block is controlled externally. To improve the efficiency of the nonlinear block and to reduce the problem of massive interconnections in the KII network, a mixed-signal design to multiplex nonlinear blocks is proposed. Simulation results and chip measurement are presented for the reduced KII set.					principe, jose/N-8099-2014; Harris, Jack/AAA-3829-2020																0-7803-7761-3				2003							837	840																WOS:000184904800210
