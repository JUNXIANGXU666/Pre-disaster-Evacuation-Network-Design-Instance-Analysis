J	Baskan, O				Baskan, Ozgur			Harmony search algorithm for continuous network design problem with link capacity expansions	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												The Continuous Network Design Problem (CNDP) deals with determining the set of link capacity expansions and the corresponding equilibrium link flows which minimizes the system performance index defined as the sum of total travel times and investment costs of link capacity expansions. In general, the CNDP is characterized by a bilevel programming model, in which the upper level problem is generally to minimize the total system cost under limited expenditure, while at the lower level problem, the User Equilibrium (UE) link flows are determined by Wardrop's first principle. It is well known that bilevel model is nonconvex and algorithms for finding global or near global optimum solutions are preferable to be used in solving it. Furthermore, the computation time is tremendous for solving the CNDP because the algorithms implemented on real sized networks require solving traffic assignment model many times. Therefore, an efficient algorithm, which is capable of finding the global or near global optimum solution of the CNDP with less number of traffic assignments, is still needed. In this study, the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is used to solve the upper level objective function and numerical calculations are performed on eighteen link and Sioux Falls networks. The lower level problem is formulated as user equilibrium traffic assignment model and Frank-Wolfe method is used to solve it. It has been observed that the HS algorithm is more effective than many other compared algorithms on both example networks to solve the CNDP in terms of the objective function value and UE traffic assignment number.

Recently, some of researches noticed that by changing the network topology, which corresponding to adding a decision whether new roadway construction between node-pairs in the given transportation network, is often more cost-effective than only sitting new facilities in given networks. Motivated by aforementioned topology changing result, this paper not only consider about new roadway construction, but also merge the roadway capacity expansion decision into transportation network design problem. The models generated from an integrated model for transportation network design and uncapacitated facility location problem. Then we merge the roadway capacity expansion part and facility capacity decision part into the original model. Mixed integrated programming and network transform mechanism for such models are proposed. Lastly, we measure the effect of roadway capacity expansion on facility sitting. The numerical testing with random generated data shows the feasible and effective of models. In conclusion part, the application in real case of proposed models and algorithms are identified.

The wide design space provided by the ECB/J modes has been used as the goal for the design. A unique bandwidth extended matching network that can achieve a broadband impedance matching in the appropriate impedance region by simultaneously manipulating six frequency points is proposed to compensate for the impedance dispersion effect caused by the change of the optimal impedance with the operating frequency in the design of the matching network. To verify the proposed methodology, a wideband PA is designed and fabricated by using a commercial 10-W gallium nitride (GaN) device. The implemented PA achieves a bandwidth of 163% from 0.4 to 3.9 GHz while exhibiting excellent performance of 38-42.3 dBm output power, 57-68% drain efficiency, and 10-13 dB gain. The measured adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is lower than-26 dBc at 0.8, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 GHz when the output power is lower than 36 dBm.					lin, lin/KFB-9548-2024; yang, le/KFB-5420-2024; lin, lin/KCZ-0185-2024; feng, yue/KHV-4687-2024; xuan, xuefei/JFJ-7458-2023	xuan, xuefei/0000-0002-3153-0413; Zhang, Zhiwei/0000-0001-8001-9606													1549-7747	1558-3791				AUG	2023	70	8					2809	2813		10.1109/TCSII.2023.3253551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2023.3253551													WOS:001043666500019

DIAT-RadHARNet: A Lightweight DCNN for Radar Based Classification of Human Suspicious Activities	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT												Recognizing suspicious human activities is one of the critical requirements for national security considerations. Nowadays, designing the deep convolution neural network (DCNN) models suitable for micro-Doppler (m-D) signature-based human activity classification is rapidly growing. However, high computation cost and a huge number of parameters limit their direct/effective usability in field applications. This article introduces an m-D signatures' dataset "DIAT-mu RadHAR" covering army crawling, boxing, jumping while holding a gun, army jogging, army marching, and stone-pelting/grenade-throwing, generated using an X-band continuous wave (CW) radar. This article also introduces a lightweight DCNN model, "DIAT-RadHARNet," designed for those human suspicious activity classification. To reduce the computation cost and to improve the generalization ability, DIAT-RadHARNet is designed with four design principles: depthwise separable convolutions, channel weighting (CHW) based on the importance, different size filters in the depthwise part, and operating different size kernels on the same input tensor. The network has 213793 parameters with a total of 55 layers. Our extensive experimental analysis demonstrates that the DIAT-RadHARNet model efficiently classifies the activities with 99.22% accuracy, giving minimal false positive and false negative outcomes. The time complexity of the proposed DCNN model observed during the testing phase is 0.35 s. The same accuracy and time complexity are obtained even at adverse weather conditions, low-lighting environments, and long-range operations.

In order to provide the confidentiality of transmission information on the level of design team in collaborative design system, a new broadcast encryption scheme based on designer's identity is presented. The new scheme is based on broadcast encryption theory. By introducing master key of design teams and distributing the public and secret parameters reasonably, every designer can encrypt design documents and transmit them expediently. The encrypted document can be decrypted only by the members of the designated design team. In the new scheme the private key escrow problem of M.-based public key system is solved. Analysis shows that the new scheme is secure under the discrete logarithm assumption and users out of the designated design team can't decrypt the documents. The new scheme can be used in the collaborative design system to protect the security of design information.																					978-0-7695-3610-1				2009							699	702		10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.346													WOS:000269060000175

Energy harvesting cognitive radio networks have been recently proposed to attempt to solve both the issues simultaneously. In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio network in which the secondary transmitter equipped with an energy harvesting device is allowed to opportunistically access the primary channel. Here, we assume that energy arrival process and primary channel state are random process and twostate time-homogeneous discrete Markov process, respectively. By using the average throughput for the secondary network as a design criterion and jointly optimizing energy harvesting and spectrum sensing, we achieve both the energy efficiency and the spectrum efficiency. In addition, the corresponding optimal detection threshold and the maximum achievable throughput are obtained, which are substantiated by our comprehensive computer simulations.

J	Li, R; Yang, M; Chu, TG				Li, Rui; Yang, Meng; Chu, Tianguang			State feedback stabilization for probabilistic Boolean networks	AUTOMATICA												A probabilistic Boolean network (PBN) is a discrete-time system composed of a family of Boolean networks (BNs) between which the PBN switches in a stochastic fashion. Studying control-related problems in PBNs may provide new insights into the intrinsic control in biological systems and enable us to develop strategies for manipulating complex biological systems using exogenous inputs. This paper investigates the problem of state feedback stabilization for PBNs. Based on the algebraic representation of logic functions, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the existence of a globally stabilizing state feedback controller, and a control design method is proposed when the presented condition holds. It is shown that the controller designed via the proposed procedure can simultaneously stabilize a collection of PBNs that are composed of the same constituent BNs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	GUHA, A				GUHA, A			CONTINUOUS PROCESS-CONTROL USING NEURAL NETWORKS	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING												We present some adaptive control strategies based on neural networks that can be used for designing controllers for continuous process control problems. Specifically, a learning algorithm has been formulated based on reinforcement learning, a weakly supervised learning technique, to solve set-point control and control scheduling for continuous processes where the process cannot be modeled easily. It is shown how reinforcement learning can be used to learn the control strategy adaptively based on exploration of the control space without making assumptions about the process model. A new learning scheme, 'handicapped learning', was developed to learn a control schedule that specifies a schedule of set points. Applications studied include the control of a nonisothermal continuously stirred tank reactor at its unstable state and the learning of the daily time-temperature schedule for an environment controller. Experimental results demonstrate good learning performance, indicating that the learning algorithm can be used for solving transient startup and boundary value control problems.																			0956-5515	1572-8145				AUG	1992	3	4					217	228		10.1007/BF01473899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01473899													WOS:A1992JG77300004

The monitor devices can be remotely controlled by the central management server and transmit the measured data to the central management server through internet with the TCP/IP protocol in the system. This system is used to continuous measure and monitor the content of radioactive aerosol (uranium, plutonium and beta.), which is harmful to human health after being inhaled by human body, in the atmosphere. If the content of radioactive aerosol in the surrounding environment exceeds the standard, the system will give an alarm in time to remind people to take action as early as possible. Because of the networked monitor system, people can remote control the monitor devices and remote measure the content of the radioactive aerosol, which can keep the surveyors away from the potentially dangerous measurement sites and can achieve 24 hours unattended continuous monitoring.																					978-1-5386-5373-9				2018							606	610																WOS:000491408500118

This issue is frequently occurred in networked control system where the packet dropouts bring obstacle for controller design. Especially, the controller terms are not allowed to be transformed directly into actuator side under the SCP. Thus, the traditional approaches are not effective to solve this design issue. In this paper, a novel sliding mode control (SMC) mechanism is given to handle the influences caused by packet dropouts, time-varying delay and SCP. A protocol -based controller is designed to guarantee that the closed-loop system is mean-square asymptotically stable with satisfactory H infinity performance. Moreover, an optimization algorithm is further provided to compute the protocol -based gain matrix. Finally, a simulation example is proposed to verify the effectiveness of the presented protocol -based SMC design procedure.

Also, the migration of CO2 through heterogeneous subsurface is very difficult to predict because small differences in material properties may result in vastly different migration patterns. Therefore, like other environmental contaminants, it is necessary to design optimized groundwater monitoring network to effectively characterize the migration of the CO2. Main objectives of this study is to construct optimized groundwater monitoring network considering hydrogeological characteristics in field-scale transport of CO2 originated from artificially-injected CO2 at the environmental impact monitoring test site in Eumseong, Korea (K-COSEM). 24 monitoring wells were installed at the site aligned with the regional groundwater flow direction. Various hydraulic tests were performed to estimate the hydraulic characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, and groundwater velocity. Groundwater monitoring network for CO2 injection and leak test constructed with regard of the heterogeneity understood through the various field tests. Three multidepth monitoring well nests each of them was composed of four monitoring well units drilled with different depths (each 18, 22, 26, 30 m deep) have been installed along the groundwater flow direction and dedicated to depth-discrete water quality monitoring in saturated zone. Additional, four multi-depth monitoring well nests each of them was composed of four unsaturated-zone monitoring well units drilled with different depths (each 5, 8, 11, 14 m deep) were also installed with a distance of 1.25 m away between saturated zone monitoring wells and were dedicated to depth-discrete gas monitoring in unsaturated zone. By these efforts, effective groundwater monitoring network for temporal and spatial CO2 leakage detection and groundwater safety management have been designed and constructed at the test site.

An enhanced possibilistic programming approach for reliable closed-loop supply chain network design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH												Most of current logistics network design models in the literature typically assume that facilities are always available and absolutely reliable while in practice, they are always subject to several operational and disruption risks. This paper proposes a reliable closed-loop supply chain network design model, which accounts for both partial and complete facility disruptions as well as the uncertainty in the critical input data. The proposed model is of mixed integer possibilistic linear programming type that aims to minimise simultaneously the total cost of opening new facilities and the expected cost of disruption scenarios. An enhanced possibilistic programming approach is proposed to deal with the epistemic uncertainty in input data. Furthermore, the p-robustness criterion is used to limit the cost of disruption scenarios and protect the designed network against random facility disruptions. Several numerical experiments along with sensitivity analyses on uncertain parameters are conducted to illustrate the significance and applicability of the developed model as well as the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach. Our results demonstrate that operational and disruption risks considerably affect the whole structure of the designed network and they must be taken into account when designing a reliable closed-loop logistics network.

However, studies on CB network design have mostly overlooked three options that may further improve system performance: passenger-route assignment, passenger transfer, and modular vehicles. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes to design a transfer-based CB network with a modular fleet while simultaneously optimizing the passenger-route assignment. To solve the optimal network structure with this new design paradigm, we formulate the network design problem into a nonlinear mixed integer optimization model. A linearization approach and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are proposed to solve the exact and near-optimal solution(s) to the model, respectively. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Sioux Falls network and a large-scale network in Chengdu, China. Results show that the customized PSO algorithm efficiently provides high quality near-optimal solutions compared with CPLEX, the genetic algorithm, and the simulated annealing algorithm. Results also show that incorporating passenger-route assignment optimization and the transfer operation produces a more costeffective CB operational network with less operational costs and higher service quality. The benefit increases as the passenger demand grows.

The power consumption can be reduced by improving the accuracy of branch prediction if additional increase in power consumption due to prediction logic cannot offset the gain from accurate branch prediction. For applications like Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), we design a new method called PC-Mix to optimize branch direction prediction and BTB size fur reduction of power consumption of RISC-V processors. In simulation, 2.5CHz RISC-V processor design is shown that PC-Mix reduces the power consumption of the original processor on CNN by 35% while keeping performance unchanged or better. Compared with the well-known Gshare mechanism, PC-Mix reduces the total power consumption of CNN by 4% in a worst case scenario. At the same the branch prediction accuracy of our scheme exceeds 95%. Meantime hardware overhead are reduced in the design without affecting performance.

In concurrent design based on a constraint network, designers determine the parameters within their advantageous intervals by their experience and preference, which results in frequent conflicts. A conflict relaxation model is designed to meet the conflict resolution requirements, which extends the conflict degree to a continuous state from the on-off condition of satisfy and conflict, then builds an objective describing the present conflict degree. As opposed to the traditional fuzzy programming methods, the method determines the conflict bottleneck and solves it at the least cost of design interval changes with the extendability of the design intervals. With constraint network, the quantitative effect of the downstream constraints can be considered before determining the design parameters. Furthermore, potential conflicts can be solved to avoid significant redesign. A bogie design example illustrates the usefulness of the method.																			1062-922X		0-7803-7087-2				2002							1789	1794																WOS:000177404200310

Two approaches on designing robust and parameter-dependent H-infinity controllers are proposed and the existence conditions of the desired controllers are derived and formulated in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. By solving the corresponding convex optimization problem, the desired controllers are obtained, respectively, and different optimal H-infinity noise-attenuation level bounds of corresponding closed-loop systems are given as well. The designed controllers have their own advantages and disadvantages regarding the conservatism and realization complexity. An illustrative example emerging in networked control systems (NCS) and numerical simulations are presented to show the applicability and effectiveness of the obtained theoretic results.

The utility of this platform was demonstrated by quantitative analysis of two breast cancer-related (BRCA1) DNA oligomer mixtures. To generate on-demand concentration gradients, the microfluidic circuit was designed using an electric-hydraulic analogy. Then a multi-gradient microfluidic channel was fabricated based on the theoretical design of the concentration control module. These micro-network structures automatically produce a series of different concentration gradients by continuously mixing Cy3-labeled DNA oligomers (BRAC1-Mutation) with TAMRA-labeled DNA oligomer (BRAC1-Wild). The SERS signals for different ratios of duplex DNA oligomer mixtures, adsorbed on the surface of silver nanoparticles, were measured under flowing conditions. Total analysis time from serial mixing to SERS detection takes less than 10 min because all experimental conditions are automatically controlled inside the exquisitely designed microfluidic channel. This novel SERS-based DNA sensing technology in a micro-network gradient channel is expected to be a powerful analytical tool to simultaneously detect multiple DNA oligomer mixtures.

Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to develop a new mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) mathematical model with a single-objective, single-product, multi-stage closed-loop supply chain network design (CLSC ND), considering the fixed transportation charge in the distribution network that has been neglected in the recently published papers in the field of CLSC ND. Since such network design challenges belong to the class of NP-hard problems, an algorithm based on ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed to design a multi-stage RL network with fixed transportation cost and variable cost for the routes. Four network characteristics of different sizes were designed, and 30 instances were randomly generated for each network characteristic to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The computational analysis of the results shows the high-quality effectiveness of the proposed ACO algorithm compared with the exact results.

J	Antony, SJ; Zhou, CH; Wang, X				Antony, SJ; Zhou, CH; Wang, X			An integrated mechanistic-neural network modelling for granular systems	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING												A hybrid neural network model is designed to predict the micro-macroscopic characteristics of particulate systems subjected to shearing. The network is initially trained to understand the micro-mechanical characteristics of particulate assemblies, by feeding the results based on three-dimensional discrete element simulations. Given the physical properties of the individual particles and the packing condition of the particulate assemblies under specified loading conditions, the network thus understands the way contact forces are distributed, the orientation of contact (fabric) networks and the evolution of stress tensor during the mechanical loading. These relationships are regarded as soft sensors. Using the signals received from soft sensors, a mechanistic neural network model is constructed to establish the relationship between the micro-macroscopic characteristics of granular assemblies subjected to shearing. The macroscopic results obtained form this hybrid mechanistic neural network modelling for data that were not part of the training signals, is compared with simulations based on discrete element modelling alone and in general, the agreement is good. The hybrid network responds to their inputs at a high speed and can be regarded as a real-time system for understanding the complex behaviour of particulate systems under mechanical process conditions.

Real-time torque control using discrete-time recurrent high-order neural networks	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS												This paper presents a discrete-time direct current (DC) motor torque tracking controller, based on a recurrent high-order neural network to identify the plant model. In order to train the neural identifier, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) based training algorithm is used. The neural identifier is in series-parallel configuration that constitutes a well approximation method of the real plant by the neural identifier. Using the neural identifier structure that is in the nonlinear controllable form, the block control (BC) combined with sliding modes (SM) control techniques in discrete-time are applied. The BC technique is used to design a nonlinear sliding manifold such that the resulting sliding mode dynamics are described by a desired linear system. For the SM control technique, the equivalent control law is used in order to the plant output tracks a reference signal. For reducing the effect of unknown terms, it is proposed a specific desired dynamics for the sliding variables. The control problem is solved by the indirect approach, where an appropriate neural network (NN) identification model is selected; the NN parameters (synaptic weights) are adjusted according to a specific adaptive law (EKF), such that the response of the NN identifier approximates the response of the real plant for the same input. Then, based on the designed NN identifier a stabilizing or reference tracking controller is proposed (BC combined with SM). The proposed neural identifier and control applicability are illustrated by torque trajectory tracking for a DC motor with separate winding excitation via real-time implementation.

Real-time monitoring provides the necessary input to the decision-making process of network management. We have developed, implemented, and evaluated a design for real-time continuous monitoring of global metrics with performance objectives, such as monitoring overhead and estimation accuracy. Global metrics describe the state of the system as a whole, in contrast to local metrics, such as device counters or local protocol states, which capture the state of a local entity. Global metrics are computed from local metrics using aggregation functions, such as SUM, AVERAGE and MAX. A key part in the design is a model for the distributed monitoring process that relates performance metrics to parameters that tune the behavior of a monitoring protocol. The model has been instrumental in designing a monitoring protocol that is controllable and achieves given performance objectives. Our design has proved to be effective in meeting performance objectives, efficient, adaptive to changes in the networking conditions, controllable along different performance dimensions, and scalable. We have implemented a prototype on a testbed of commercial routers, which proves the feasibility of the design, and, more generally, the feasibility of effective and efficient real-time monitoring in large network environments.																					978-1-4244-3486-2				2009							790	795																WOS:000274304300105

The Generalized Minimum Edge-Biconnected Network Problem: Efficient Neighborhood Structures for Variable Neighborhood Search	NETWORKS					International Network Optimization Conference	APR 22-25, 2007	Spa, BELGIUM					We consider the generalized minimum edge-biconnected network problem where the nodes of a graph are partitioned into clusters and exactly one node from each cluster is required to be connected in an edge-biconnected way. Instances of this problem appear, for example, in the design of survivable backbone networks. We present different variants of a variable neighborhood search approach that utilize different types of neighborhood structures, each of them addressing particular properties as spanned nodes and/or the edges between them. For the more complex neighborhood structures, we apply efficient techniques such as a graph reduction to essentially speed up the search process. For comparison purposes, we use a mixed integer linear programming formulation based on multi-commodity flows to solve smaller instances of this problem to proven optimality. Experiments on such instances indicate that the variable neighborhood search is also able to identify optimal solutions in the majority of test runs, but within substantially less time. Tests on larger Euclidean and random instances with up to 1,280 nodes, which could not be solved to optimality by mixed integer programming, further document the efficiency of the variable neighborhood search. In particular, all proposed neighborhood structures are shown to contribute significantly to the search process. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Extra network resources are needed to increase network survivability level. In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to augment the network topology with adding new links and allocate spare capacity to maximize the service restorability against node failures in SDH/SONET mesh networks. A scheme called maximal node-disjoint backup paths provisioning with topology augmentation is proposed to tackle the problem, and another scheme called globally optimized path provisioning with topology augmentation, which allows adjusting the existing working paths of network flows, is investigated to optimize the augmented network globally. Both schemes are formulated as mixed integer linear programming models. Furthermore, heuristic algorithms are investigated to be implemented in software. Three algorithms, i.e., added links searching method, successive maximal survivable routing method, and random sequence routing convergence method, are designed and compared.

We model nonlinear systems in Takagi-Sugetno (T-S) form and then develop fuzzy decentralized state feedback controllers with missing measurements. A sufficient condition on stochastic stability in the mean-square sense for the NCS is obtained by using Lyapunov function method. The constructive design of the controllers is expressed as the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the result of this paper.

Although production costs decline, logistics costs are negatively affected. Individual companies with limited shipment volumes do not have access to cost efficient and highly productive transport networks. Multimodal, cross-company logistics models are one approach to open up the potentials of transport networks for companies. This paper deals with the conceptual design and evaluation of cross-company logistics models.

J	Xu, Y; Gurfinkel, AJ; Rikvold, PA				Xu, Yan; Gurfinkel, Aleks Jacob; Rikvold, Per Arne			Architecture of the Florida power grid as a complex network	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												We study the Florida high-voltage power grid as a technological network embedded in space. Measurements of geographical lengths of transmission lines, the mixing of generators and loads, the weighted clustering coefficient, as well as the organization of edge conductance weights show a complex architecture quite different from random-graph models usually considered. In particular, we introduce a parametrized mixing matrix to characterize the mixing pattern of generators and loads in the Florida Grid, which is intermediate between the random mixing case and the semi-bipartite case where generator generator transmission lines are forbidden. Our observations motivate an investigation of optimization (design) principles leading to the structural organization of power grids. We thus propose two network optimization models for the Florida Grid as a case study. Our results show that the Florida Grid is optimized not only by reducing the construction cost (measured by the total length of power lines), but also through reducing the total pairwise edge resistance in the grid, which increases the robustness of power transmission between generators and loads against random line failures. We then embed our models in spatial areas of different aspect ratios and study how this geometric factor affects the network structure, as well as the box-counting fractal dimension of the grids generated by our models.

First, the principles of connectionism are briefly recalled. Some neural networks are then constructed in which the different mix-design parameters of a variety of cement conglomerates, i.e. the compressive strength, are associated. The experimental data obtained during construction of the 'Alto Sulcis Thermal Power Station' at Portovesme, Italy, were used in the tests. The availability of a substantial amount of data enabled the method to be suitably calibrated and satisfactory results were obtained for evaluating the mechanical properties of different concrete mixes.

The conflicting objectives considered in this study are maximizing the total net profit related to the supply chain network design and minimizing the probability of tardiness associated with transportation leadtime between manufacturing plant and distribution centers, and distribution centers and customers. It is assumed that possible risk associated with transportation leadtime follows a normal distribution with the established mean and standard deviation. The model was tested by varying risk levels in order to achieve the maximum satisfaction level in the network. By considering the acceptable satisfaction levels, analyzing the results of the proposed model will be providing different scenarios, which helps decision makers to have better insight to design the desired supply chain network. Results indicate that by decreasing the risk level, probability of earliness to deliver products to customers increases while profit decreases. (C) 2019 The Authors.

This increases the need of LANs for IEDs to exchange data for improved and coordinated operations through peer-to-peer networking. Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3), commonly used for power system communications, is lack of effective internet-working LANs and individual YEDs. To improve the internetworking capability, this paper proposes a network address mechanism (NAM) that provides dynamic routing operations and a variable address field. The NAM is designed to provide WAN internetworking capabilities that can be implemented for IEDs with minimal effects on the network specifications, such as continuous use of established network addresses. The NAM is also designed to provide the capability for unlimited WAN expansion regardless of network structures and to enhance the network cyber-security.																					978-1-4244-0556-5				2006							71	75																WOS:000246036900011

W.; Sun, Huijun; Feng, Zengzhe; Wu, Jianjun			Braess Paradox of traffic networks with mixed equilibrium behaviors	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW												Under the user equilibrium (UE) behavior assumption, the Braess Paradox (BP) and its variations have been well investigated. However, users do not always follow the UE behavior. In reality, there are likely quiet a few non-collaborative Cournot-Nash (CN) players coexisting with UE players in the common traffic network. Users in a CN player are completely collaborative to minimize their total travel cost and users subordinating to different players are perfectly competitive. Considering both UE and CN players in the congested network, it remains unclear that under what conditions the BP will occur. In this paper, the BP occurrence conditions under the UE-CN mixed equilibrium are firstly investigated using the classical Braess network with linear link cost function. Then, the BP conditions are studied to the ordinary grid network with nonlinear link cost function. It is shown that the BP occurrence in the conventional Braess network depends upon the link travel time function parameters and the demand level of users controlled by UE/CN players, and the BP occurs in the grid network only for certain demand combinations of users under one UE player and two CN players.

First, at each equilibrium point, one neural network is trained offline to identify the linear term of the nonlinear system while the other neural network is trained online to identify the nonlinear term. Then the multiple models is composed of all models which is got from each equilibrium point. According to the switching index, the best model is selected as the system model. So, for the selected model, the nonlinear term is viewed as the measurable disturbance and eliminated using feedforward strategy. By the choice of the polynomial matrices, the poles of the linear term can be placed arbitrarily and the dynamical decoupling controller is designed accordingly. The simulation example shows effectiveness of the proposed system.					chen, bin/KBQ-8114-2024; Liu, Fuyi/KDO-6120-2024	chen, bin/0000-0002-3398-1314; 															1-4244-0331-6				2006							2763	+																WOS:000241773203037

Vector quantization is one of the popular methods in Image Compression approaches. Code book design from training vectors is an important step in Vector Quantization. In the literature it is found that the various compression techniques employing DWT are not resulting the expected Signal to Noise ratio in the decompressed images. Recently Neural Network approaches are used for image compression due to its generalizing capability. Currently Fuzzy Neural Networks are employed to design codebook. In this paper to improve the Signal to Noise ratio in the decompressed image and to achieve high compression ratio, a Rough Fuzzy Hopfield Neural Network associated with DCT image decomposition technique is employed. The proposed RFHN approach using DCT, results in the increased compression ratio and the reduced execution time compared to the previous approach using DWT.																					3-936150-38-9				2004							233	238																WOS:000222802100032

To identify the optimal mix of transport network technologies (optical/wireless) and processing modules that are required to support 5G services in a cost-and energy-efficient manner, a two-stage optimization framework is proposed.

This is performed through the identification of the optimal mix of wireless and optical transport network technologies. The second stage focuses on the compute network segment and aims at identifying suitable processing modules to which operational 5G services need to be allocated.

J	Todinov, MT				Todinov, Michael T.			Analysis and Optimization of Repairable Flow Networks With Complex Topology	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY												We propose a frame work for analysis and optimization of repairable flow networks by (i) stating and proving the maximum flow minimum flow path resistance theorem for networks with merging flows (ii) a discrete-event solver for determining the variation of the output flow from repairable flow networks with complex topology (iii) a procedure for determining the threshold flow rate reliability for repairable networks with complex topology (iv) a method for topology optimization of repairable flow networks and (v) an efficient algorithm for maximizing the flow in non-reconfigurable flow networks with merging flows. Maximizing the flow in a static flow network does not necessarily guarantee that the flow in the corresponding non-reconfigurable repairable network will be maximized. In this respect, we introduce a new concept related to repairable flow networks: 'a specific resistance of a flow path' which is essentially the average percentage of losses from component failures for a flow path from the source to the sink. A very efficient algorithm based on adjacency arrays has also been proposed for determining all minimal flow paths in a network with complex topology and cycles. We formulate and prove a fundamental theorem about non-reconfigurable repairable flow networks with merging flows. The flow in a repairable flow network with merging flows can be maximized by preferentially saturating directed flow paths from the sources to the sink, characterized by the largest average availability. The procedure starts with the flow path with the largest average availability (the smallest specific resistance), and continues by saturating the unsaturated directed flow path with the largest average availability until no more flow paths can be saturated. A discrete-event solver for reconfigurable repairable flow networks with complex topology has also been constructed. The proposed discrete-event solver maximizes the flow rate in the network upon each component failure and return from repair. By maximizing the flow rate upon each component failure and return from repair, the discrete-event solver ensures a larger total output flow during a specified time interval. The designed simulation procedure for determining the threshold flow rate reliability is particularly useful for comparing flow network topologies, and selecting the topology characterized by the largest threshold flow rate reliability. It is also very useful in deciding whether the resources allocated for purchasing extra redundancy are justified. Finally, we propose a new optimization method for determining the network topology combining a maximum output flow rate attained within a specified budget for building the network. The optimization method is based on a branch and bound algorithm combined with pruning the full-complexity network as a way of exploring the possible repairable networks embedded in the full-complexity network.																			0018-9529					MAR	2011	60	1					111	124		10.1109/TR.2011.2104453	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TR.2011.2104453													WOS:000287861400015

The nominal plant is described by a discrete-time time-varying linear system subject to random jumping according with a non-homogeneous Markov chain with a finite number of states. The class of admissible uncertainties consists of multiplicative white noise type perturbations with unknown intensity. It is assumed that the intensity of white noise type perturbations is modelled by unknown nonlinear functions subject to linear growth conditions. The class of admissible controls consists of stabilising state feedback control laws. We show that the best robustness performance is achieved by the stability provided by a state feedback design based on the stabilising solution of a suitable discrete-time Riccati-type equation.																			0020-7721	1464-5319					2014	45	7			SI		1508	1517		10.1080/00207721.2013.860643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2013.860643													WOS:000337363200017

In discrete approach for designing reconfigurable circuits the switch is an undeniable part. But the number of switches can make many problems such as amount of noise factor. Here, a LNA has been introduced which has only one switch and is designed with discrete tuning technique that can show good performance at mentioned frequencies. Besides, the input matching network uses a circuit that presents relatively fixed real part in input impedance, and therefore, input matching is satisfied. Using current reuse technique causes the overall gain is set in high amount.

However, it remains challenging for HSEs to achieve stable performance in desalination, partly due to the tradeoff between desired evaporation dynamics and salt tolerance. Here, composite hydrogels with tunable self-assembled nanofiber networks are exploited for the engineering of solar evaporators with both high evaporation performance and resistance to salt accumulation. The nanofibrous hydrogel solar evaporators (NHSEs) present an intrinsic open network with high porosity, above 90%, enabling continuous water channels for efficient mass transfer. Theoretical modeling captures the complex nexus between microstructures and evaporation performance by coupling water transfer, thermal conduction, and vaporization enthalpy during evaporation. The mechanistic understanding and engineering tuning of the composites lead to an optimum configuration of NHSEs, which demonstrate a stable evaporation rate of 2.85 kg m-2 h-1 during continuous desalination in 20% brine. The outstanding performance of NHSEs and the underlying design principles may facilitate further development of practical desalination systems. A nanofibrous hydrogel with tunable microstructures and compositions is developed for solar desalination. The highly continuous microchannels in the hydrogels enable efficient mass transfer for stable solar desalination with an ultrahigh evaporation rate of 2.85 kg m-2 h-1 in 20% brine. General principles for the design of hydrogel evaporators are provided by understanding the nexus between microstructures vaporization performance.image					sun, mingze/KTH-8969-2024	Wexin, Zhang/0000-0002-1524-1857; Li, Hao/0000-0003-0702-7380													1616-301X	1616-3028				NOV	2023	33	47								10.1002/adfm.202308492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202308492		SEP 2023											WOS:001056067100001

Two problems are solved in this paper: a total transmits power minimization problem and a total network consumption minimization problem. The first problem is to minimize the total transmit power of RAUs by designing beamforming. While the other is to minimize the total network consumption by beamforming and switching off unnecessary RAUs, which is a joint design of sparse beamforming and RAU selection. It is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and hard to deal with. Approximations are made to convert the problems into convex ones by using the difference of convex programming and a mixed l(1)/l(2)-norm. Then, the iterative algorithms are proposed to solve the problems. The simulation results show that by using proposed algorithms, the transmit power consumption and the network power consumption can be significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the number of active RAUs can be effectively decreased.

While networks are no longer limited by transmission bandwidth, the key issue in WDM network design has evolved towards the processing capabilities of electronic switches, routers and multiplexers. Therefore, we focus here on traffic grooming with minimum interconnecting equipment cost. We first formulate the problem as a generic integer linear programming (ILP) or a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem that encompasses several design specifications: UPSR vs BLSR, non bifurcated vs bifurcated flows, wavelength continuity constrained or free signal regeneration. Within the context of second generation SONET/WDM rings, we define the cost by a function of the number of transport blades, taking into account that the number of transport blades makes up a significant portion of the overall network cost. Using the CPLEX mixed ILP package, we next compare the optimal solutions of the ILP or MILP programs for different design assumptions, including the classical assumptions with a single hub where the lightpaths directly connect the hub to all other nodes.																			1550-3607		0-7803-8938-7				2005							1708	1712																WOS:000231726402055

Low-Complexity Antenna Selection and Discrete Phase-Shifts Design in IRS-Assisted Multiuser Massive MIMO Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY												We propose two novel antenna selection (AS) and discrete phase-shifts design (PSD) schemes for use in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks. The first AS and PSD method aims at maximizing the gain of the channels; while the second method is an iterative sum-rate maximization (ISM) scheme that aims at maximizing the total achievable rate. For the AS part, we demonstrate that the ISM method achieves near optimal performance with much lower complexity compared to benchmark AS schemes, and can be utilized with any precoder at the mMIMO base station. For the PSD, our proposed successive-refinement optimization methods are not only efficient, but their complexities scale linearly with the number of elements at the IRS, making them highly attractive when dealing with large surfaces. A thorough complexity analysis for the proposed methods is carried out in terms of the number of floating point operations required for their implementations. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided and some key points are highlighted on the performance of the proposed schemes with both conjugate beamforming and zero-forcing precoders.

A design method is proposed by applying the decomposition of the global discrete-time algebraic Riccati equations. A computationally tractable solution can be obtained by solving four local algebraic Riccati equations which have the same dimensions as a single agent. The stability condition is given in terms of the spectrum of two matrices representing the desired sparsity pattern of the distributed controller and distributed observer.

However, in modern cities, road maintenance work needs to occupy some traffic resources; therefore, unreasonable road maintenance schemes often lead traffic networks to unexpected large-scale congestion. In this paper, a dynamic programming model is proposed in order to minimize the delay caused by road maintenance scheme. This model can obtain a globally optimal maintenance scheme which contains the decisions and sequence for every stage of maintenance. Each stage of this model can be boiled down to a discrete network design problem. This model helps make suggestions for the traffic managers with the request of minimizing the delay caused by the maintenance scheme. This paper uses two examples to illustrate this method, one is a small-scale Nguyen-Dupuis network, and the other one is a larger scale Sioux-Falls network.

In furtherance of this ideal, this paper addresses the challenge of achieving interconnectivity between multiple wireless community networks from a novel perspective based on coordination theory. This paper presents a design framework that proposes the features of the communication protocols, routing algorithms and resource sharing schemes that will be necessary in enabling communication between wireless community networks.

J	Wakui, T; Hashiguchi, M; Yokoyama, R				Wakui, Tetsuya; Hashiguchi, Moe; Yokoyama, Ryohei			Structural design of distributed energy networks by a hierarchical combination of variable- and constraint-based decomposition methods	ENERGY												A near-optimal solution method of a large-scale design problem of a distributed energy network, consisting of multiple energy-supply systems under power and heat interchanges, is developed by hierarchically combining variable-and constraint-based decompositions. The design problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming, and its scale increases with the number of connected energy supply systems and daily patterns of energy demand. By focusing on the hierarchical relationship between design and operation variables, the original problem is decomposed into an upper-level design problem and lower-level coordinated operation problems based on the Benders decomposition. By focusing on power-and heat-interchange constraints, the coordinated operation problem is further decomposed into a master problem concerning power and heat interchanges and subproblems for energy supply in each energy-supply system based on the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. A near-optimal solution is calculated through a two-level iterative calculation, consisting of delayed constraint generation between the design problem and the coordinated operation problems and delayed column generation between the master problem and the subproblems in each coordinated operation problem. The near-optimal solution method is applied to the structural design problem of distributed energy networks incorporating 5e100 cogeneration systems, in which suboptimal solutions cannot be found in the conventional solution method. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

One important step is the separation of stickies that are normally attached to the paper. If not properly separated, remaining stickies reduce the quality of the recovered paper or even disrupt the production process. For the mechanical separation process of fibers from stickies a separator screen is used. This machine has one input feed and two output streams, called the accept and the reject. In the accept the fibers are concentrated, whereas the reject has a higher concentration of stickies. The machine can be controlled by setting its reject rate. But even when the reject rate is set properly, after just a single screening step, the accept still has too many stickies, or the reject too many fibers. To get a better separation, several separators have to be assembled into a network. From a mathematical point of view this problem can be seen as a multi-commodity network flow design problem with a nonlinear, controllable distribution function at each node. We present a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model for the simultaneous selection of the network's topology and the optimal setting of each separator. Numerical results are obtained via different types of linearization of the nonlinearities and the use of mixed-integer linear solvers, and compared with state-of-the-art global optimization software.

Though neural network-based CF models have been shown to perform well in some cases, they still suffer from the sparsity and cold-start issues. To address these issues, we propose a novel neural network-based CF model, termed the cross-domain explicit-implicit-mixed CF neural network (CEICFNet). The proposed model utilizes deep neural networks to learn latent factors not only from the explicit ratings and the implicit interactions but also in a cross-domain manner. In particular, domain-shared multilayer perception (MLP) networks are designed to learn the user rating latent factors and the user interaction latent factors from the explicit ratings and the implicit interactions, respectively, which act as bridges for transferring knowledge across domains. On the other hand, domain-specific MLP networks are designed to learn the item rating latent factors and the item interaction latent factors from the explicit ratings and the implicit interactions, respectively. Then, in each domain, based on the user rating latent factors and the item rating latent factors, the rating predictive representation for each user-item pair can be learned by an MLP. Similarly, the interaction predictive representation for each user-item pair can be learned. For integrating the explicit ratings and the implicit interactions, in each domain, a fully connected layer is used to automatically assign different weights to the rating predictive representations and the interaction predictive representations, based on which the final interaction probability can be generated. Extensive experiments are conducted on five datasets and the results have confirmed the effectiveness of our model.

J	Gao, ZY; Sun, HJ; Zhang, HZ				Gao, Ziyou; Sun, Huijun; Zhang, Haozhi			A globally convergent algorithm for transportation continuous network design problem	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING					3rd International Conference on Optimization and Control with Applications	JUL 25-31, 2004	Chongqing City, PEOPLES R CHINA					The continuous network design problem (CNDP) is characterized by a bilevel programming model, in which the upper level problem is generally to minimize the total system cost under limited expenditure, while at the lower level the network users make choices with regard to route conditions following the user equilibrium principle. In this paper, the bilevel programming model for CNDP is transformed into a single level convex programming problem by virtue of an optimal-value function tool and the relationship between System Optimum ( SO) and User Equilibrium (UE). By exploring the inherent nature of the CNDP, the optimal-value function for the lower level user equilibrium problem is proved to be continuously differentiable and its derivative in link capacity enhancement can be obtained efficiently by implementing user equilibrium assignment subroutine. However, the reaction (or response) function between the upper and lower level problem is implicit and its gradient is difficult to obtain. Although, here we approximately express the gradient with the difference concept at each iteration, based on the method of successive averages (MSA), we propose a globally convergent algorithm to solve the single level convex programming problem. Comparing with widely used heuristic algorithms, such as sensitivity analysis based (SAB) method, the proposed algorithm needs not strong hypothesis conditions and complex computation for the inverse matrix. Finally, a numerical example is presented to compare the proposed method with some existing algorithms.																			1389-4420					SEP	2007	8	3					241	257		10.1007/s11081-007-9015-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11081-007-9015-1													WOS:000248766600002
J	Chandwani, G; Sen, R; Datta, D				Chandwani, Gitanjali; Sen, Rajat; Datta, Debasish			Comprehensive design methodology for control and data planes in wavelength-routed optical networks	PHOTONIC NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS												We propose a comprehensive design methodology for control and data planes of wavelength-routed optical networks (WRONs) employing mixed-line-rate (MLR) transmission for cost-effective resource provisioning. The proposed approach attempts to minimize the maximum lightpath capacity demand in Gbps (representing the measure of lightpath congestion) in network for a given traffic matrix by using a mix of a heuristic scheme and linear programming (LP). In the first step of the proposed three-step design, some lightpaths are set up on a set of judiciously selected fiber links (with point-to-point lightpaths between neighboring nodes), on a specific wavelength throughout the network, and an appropriate fraction of the same set of lightpaths is utilized for carrying control information, forming therefore the control plane (CP) of the WRON. The remaining bandwidth of these lightpaths is utilized to carry the data traffic along with all other designed lightpaths of the WRON using appropriate algorithm, forming the overall data plane (DP) of the WRON. In the second step, traffic routing is carried out through LP to minimize lightpath congestion in the network. In the third step, we utilize the results of LP to assign rates to lightpaths, such that the cost (considering only the transceiver cost) of the network is minimized. This design leads to congestion-aware MLR network with due consideration to cost-effectiveness without compromising the network restoration response against link failures. We carry out simulation studies employing possible CPs using both symmetric (CP topology being same as the physical topology) as well as asymmetric (using fewer fiber links than the symmetric case) topology. The results of our simulations indicate that the proposed design of CP with symmetric/asymmetric topology and in-band transmission with sub-lightpath capacity can bring down network congestion and cost with respect to symmetric out-of-band transmission (using fully reserved lightpaths for CP), without any perceptible sacrifice in respect of the network restoration time. Failure can occur either in CP or DP, or in both the planes. We investigate the effect of design of CP with symmetric/asymmetric topology on network restoration time for single- and double-link failures. We further present DP design methodology with hybrid restoration scheme, i.e., combination of dedicated (1:1) path protection and path restoration. We analyze the effect of symmetric CP topology and degree of protection on the congestion of the network. Some lightpaths, that support more traffic, are protected against failures, while the others are left for path restoration in the event of failures. As more lightpaths are protected, the congestion and power consumption of network increase. We provide an analysis of the factors that come into play while altering the degree of protection and observe how the choice for the degree of protection in DP can be arrived at using an appropriate design methodology.

A parameter free Continuous Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for the optimal design of storm sewer networks: Constrained and unconstrained approach	ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE												This paper describes the application of the newly introduced Continuous Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (CACOA) to optimal design of sewer networks. Two alternative approaches to implement the algorithm is presented and applied to a storm sewer network in which the nodal elevations of the network are considered as the decision variables of the optimization problem. In the first and unconstrained approach, a Gaussian probability density function is used to represent the pheromone concentration over the allowable range of each decision variable. The pheromone concentration function is used by each ant to randomly sample the nodal elevations of the trial networks. This method, however, will lead to solutions which may be infeasible regarding some or all of the constraints of the problem and in particular the minimum slope constraint. In the second and constrained approach, known value of the elevation at downstream node of a pipe is used to define new bounds on the elevation of the upstream node satisfying the explicit constraints on the pipe slopes. Two alternative formulations of the constrained algorithm are used to solve a test example and the results are presented and compared with those of unconstrained approach. The methods are shown to be very effective in locating the optimal solution and efficient in terms of the convergence characteristics of the resulting algorithms. The proposed algorithms are also found to be relatively insensitive to the initial colony and size of the colony used compared to the original algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A new methodology to design multi-sensor networks for distributed large-volume metrology systems based on triangulation	PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												Distributed Large-Volume Metrology (LVM) systems are mainly used for industrial applications concerning assembly and dimensional verification of large-sized objects. These systems generally consist of a set of network devices, distributed around the measurement volume, and some targets to be localized, in contact with the measured object's surface or mounted on a hand-held probe for measuring the points of interest. Target localization is carried out through several approaches, which use angular and/or distance measurements by network devices. This paper presents a new methodology to support the design of networks of devices, for distributed LVM systems based on triangulation (i.e., systems in which network devices perform angular measurements only). It is assumed that these systems use multi-sensor networks including two typologies of devices: some are accurate but expensive and other ones are less accurate but cheaper. The goal of the methodology is establishing a link between the following parameters: (i) density of network devices, (ii) mix between the two typologies of network devices, (iii) measurement uncertainty, and (iv) cost. The methodology allows to estimate the most appropriate density and mix between the two typologies of network devices, so that the distributed LVM system is conforming with the required measurement uncertainty and cost. The methodology relies on a large number of simulated experiments, defined and implemented using a dedicated routine; feasibility and practicality is tested by preliminary experiments on a multi-sensor photogrammetric system, developed at Politecnico di Torino-DIGEP.

For growth-coupled production, a minimal reaction-network-based design is known to be effective. However, the obtained reaction networks often fail to be realized by gene deletions due to conflicts with gene-protein-reaction (GPR) relations. Here, we developed gDel_minRN that determines gene deletion strategies using mixed-integer linear programming to achieve growth-coupled production by repressing the maximum number of reactions via GPR relations. The results of computational experiments showed that gDel_minRN could determine the core parts, which include only 30% to 55% of whole genes, for stoichiometrically feasible growth-coupled production for many target metabolites, which include useful vitamins such as biotin (vitamin B7), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and pantothenate (vitamin B5). Since gDel_minRN calculates a constraint-based model of the minimum number of gene-associated reactions without conflict with GPR relations, it helps biological analysis of the core parts essential for growth-coupled production for each target metabolite. The source codes, implemented in MATLAB using CPLEX and COBRA Toolbox, are available on https://github.com/MetNetComp/gDel-minRN.

Supporting Energy-Efficient Uploading Strategies for Continuous Sensing Applications on Mobile Phones	PERVASIVE COMPUTING, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science				7th International Conference on Pervasive Computing	MAY 17-20, 2010	Helsinki, FINLAND	Univ Helsinki, Dept Comp Sci, Helsinki Inst Informat Technol				Continuous sensing applications (e.g., mobile social networking applications) are appearing on new sensor-enabled mobile phones such as the Apple iPhone, Nokia and Android phones. These applications present significant challenges to the phone's operations given the phone's limited computational and energy resources and the need for applications to share real-time continuous sensed data with back-end servers. System designers have to deal with a trade-off between data accuracy (i.e., application fidelity) and energy constraints in the design of uploading strategies between phones and back-end servers. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of several techniques to optimize the information uploading process for continuous sensing on mobile phones. We analyze the cases of continuous and intermittent connectivity imposed by low-duty cycle design considerations or poor wireless network coverage in order to drive down energy consumption and extend the lifetime of the phone. We also show how location prediction can be integrated into this forecasting framework. We present the implementation and the experimental evaluation of these uploading techniques based on measurements from the deployment of a continuous sensing application on 20 Nokia N95 phones used by 20 people for a period of 2 weeks. Our results show that we can make significant energy savings while limiting the impact on the application fidelity, making continuous sensing a viable application for mobile phones. For example, we show that it is possible to achieve an accuracy of 80% with respect to ground-truth data while saving 60% of the traffic sent over-the-air.

By using an active sampling method, random time delays are reshaped into short time delays which are less than one sampling period such that the structure of the augmented discrete-time model becomes straightforward. Based on Lyapunov approach, sufficient conditions for the stochastic stability of the networked control system are derived and mode-dependent controller is designed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to overcome the adverse influences of stochastic time delays and packet dropouts encountered in network-based distributed real-time control. Gridding approach is introduced to guarantee the solvability of the LMIs with finite jump modes.

J	Chu, XA; Li, MG				Chu, Xiaoan; Li, Muguo			Integrated event-triggered fault estimation and fault-tolerant control for discrete-time fuzzy systems with input quantization and incomplete measurements	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												This paper addresses the problem of robust integrated fault estimation (FE) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) for a class of discrete-time networked Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with two-channel event-triggered schemes, input quantization and incomplete measurements. The incomplete information under consideration includes randomly occurring sensor saturation and randomly occurring quantization. In order to save the limited networked resources, this paper firstly proposed a novel dynamic event-triggered scheme on the sensor side and a static one on the controller side. Secondly, an event-triggered FE observer for the T-S fuzzy model is designed to estimate actuator faults and system states, simultaneously. Then, a specified discrete sliding surface in the state-estimation space is constructed. By using time-delay analysis technique and considering the effects of event-triggered scheme, quantization, networked conditions, actuator fault and external disturbance, the sliding mode dynamics and error dynamics are unified into a new networked time-delay model. Based on this model, sufficient conditions are established such that the resulting augmented fuzzy system is stochastically stable with a prescribed H-infinity performance level with a single-step linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation. Furthermore, an observer-based sliding mode controller for reaching motion is synthesized to guarantee the reachability of the sliding surface. Finally, a single-link flexible manipulator example is present to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hu, ZY; Parwani, V; Hu, GP				Hu, Zhengyang; Parwani, Viren; Hu, Guiping			Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Design under Uncertainties Using Fuzzy Decision Making	LOGISTICS-BASEL												The importance of considering forward and backward flows simultaneously in supply chain networks spurs an interest to develop closed-loop supply chain networks (CLSCN). Due to the expanded scope in the supply chain, designing CLSCN often faces significant uncertainties. This paper proposes a fuzzy multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to deal with uncertain parameters in CLSCN. The two objective functions are minimization of overall system costs and minimization of negative environmental impact. Negative environmental impacts are measured and quantified through CO2 equivalent emission. Uncertainties include demand, return, scrap rate, manufacturing cost and negative environmental factors. The original formulation with uncertain parameters is firstly converted into a crisp model and then an aggregation function is applied to combine the objective functions. Numerical experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model formulation and solution approach. Sensitivity analyses on degree of feasibility, the weighing of objective functions and coefficient of compensation have been conducted. This model can be applied to a variety of real-world situations, such as in the manufacturing production processes.

To show this impact, two FDCL designs are analysed. The first designed before considering protection and the second created specifically to solve the protection issues realised in the first. One of the main aspects of the FDCL is to be placed into an existing network, reuse existing equipment, and not require any changes outside of the substations of installation. In this way, the converters must be sized in such a way to retain selectivity of the lower network as well as be able to secure a continuous supply of power through the link even in the case of a DC-side fault. How this is performed and the converter overrating requirements are determined for a 10 kV MV link.																			2051-3305					OCT	2018		15					1291	1296		10.1049/joe.2018.0226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/joe.2018.0226													WOS:000447973200098

J	Park, T; Lee, K				Park, Taejune; Lee, Kilho			Supporting ultra-low latency mixed-criticality communication using hardware-based data plane architecture	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS												Recent advances in embedded computing and networking technologies have led to a growing presence of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). An important trend is that recent CPS are typically composed of Mixed-Criticality (MC) systems that integrate multiple components with different criticality levels into shared networked systems and schedule them with different policies according to the system mode. In order to enable such MC scheduling, it is essential that CPS networking systems support mode detection and transition mechanisms. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has focused on supporting such key mechanisms considering the crucial emerging CPS requirements: high bandwidth and ultra-low latency (ULL). To address this, we propose MC-HDP, an Ethernet-based CPS networking system that can provide such mode management mechanisms capable of meeting the ULL requirement (i.e., mu s-level). The proposed system extends Ethernet switches by employing hardware-based internal components, carefully designed to reduce and bound delay/overhead for mode detection and transition. Based on the system design, we derive an analytic delay bound for mode changes. For evaluation, we implemented a prototype of MC-HDP on top of NetFPGA-SUME and built a precise measurement environment using an in-house ULL packet generating tool. The evaluation result shows that MC-HDP achieves mu s-level mode change delay (i.e., up to 4.66 mu s in our setup), while the state-of-the-art mixed-criticality SDN and the standard SDN systems result in up to 2.63 and 117.2 ms of the mode change delays, respectively. The result proves that MC-HDP is highly effective in supporting the MC scheduling with ULL requirements, based on this improved mode change delay faster than the standard SDN by four orders of magnitude.																			1084-8045	1095-8592				AUG	2022	204								103401	10.1016/j.jnca.2022.103401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2022.103401		MAY 2022											WOS:000830513700002

However, the large variety of user flavors motivates the possibility of continuous transition among different output effects. Unlike existing methods that require a specific design to achieve one particular transition (e.g., style transfer), we propose a simple yet universal approach to attain a smooth control of diverse imagery effects in many low-level vision tasks, including image restoration, image-to-image translation, and style transfer. Specifically, our method, namely Deep Network Interpolation (DNI), applies linear interpolation in the parameter space of two or more correlated networks. A smooth control of imagery effects can be achieved by tweaking the interpolation coefficients. In addition to DNI and its broad applications, we also investigate the mechanism of network interpolation from the perspective of learned filters.

The EPANET model considers that the mixing on cross junctions of pipes is complete, including the cases of two contiguous inlets and two contiguous outlets. The output concentration of this model is the same value on the two outlets. This research proposes a code to generate an INP file for EPANET but with an incomplete mixing scenario in the crossings. The cross junctions are identified, and their hydraulic and concentration conditions are analyzed for each quality time step. Bypass pipes are included in the model to remove concentrations generated by the complete mixing model, preserve continuity in water quality and ensure the correct allocation of concentration. The concentration at the outlets is obtained by a system of polynomial equations representing the incomplete mixing model as a function of the hydraulic and concentration at the junction inlets. The outlets' concentrations are incorporated by setpoint boosters. Validations are described to demonstrate the achievement of the new code. An average relative concentration difference of up to 14% is obtained in networks with different scenarios for the two mixing models.					; Ramos, Helena M./M-6098-2013	Mora Rodriguez, Jose de Jesus/0000-0002-4192-8249; Pineda-Sandoval, Joseph Daniel/0000-0001-7524-1579; DELGADO-GALVAN, XITLALI/0000-0001-7283-0239; Ramos, Helena M./0000-0002-9028-9711														2073-4441				DEC	2023	15	24							4253	10.3390/w15244253	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15244253													WOS:001135981400001

Hence, it is beneficial to account simultaneously for decisions on truck facility location design and network expansion to mitigate the additional congestion caused by trucks and facilitate their routing. This study developed an integrated mathematical model for facility location design under network routing and congestion constraints. The model determines the optimal number and location of replenishment facilities, minimizes truck routing costs on the basis of proposed network design, assigns traffic in the network (for both general roadway users and service trucks), and selects candidate links for possible roadway capacity expansion. The model aims to minimize the total costs for new facility construction, truck routing, transportation infrastructure expansion, and transportation delay. A genetic algorithm framework was developed that incorporates a continuous approximation model for truck routing cost estimation and a traffic assignment algorithm. The numerical results show that the integrated solution technique can solve the problem effectively.

This is quite challenging in a multi-echelon supply chain involving multiple suppliers, multiple products, multiple time periods and multimodal transportation. This research deals with the design of a decarbonised supply chain network, under a dynamic environment, considering carbon emissions at various stages of the supply chain. A Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) has been developed for a four-echelon supply chain. The problem is solved by using two approaches. The integrated approach, which considers the entire supply chain network as a single entity, yields better results in terms of profitability and more so, when the selling price is lower. Scenario analysis reveals that as the carbon cap reduces, the gross profit shows concomitant reduction and when the former goes below a threshold value, carbon procurement becomes necessary lowering the gross profit further. As the carbon price per unit increases, the gross profit initially decreases and then stabilises. This study contributes by developing an integrated dynamic supply chain network model incorporating carbon emissions at different stages.

In this paper, we studied a blood supply chain network design consisting of four conventional levels each of which corresponding to one entity in the real world: donors, blood collection facilities, blood centers, and hospitals. The blood supply chain network considered two important properties: ABO-Rh factors and shelf lives of blood products. Moreover, an integrated inventory system for sharing hospitals' inventory levels is considered to investigate the two performance indicators of the network in terms of cross-matching and outdated units. This type of inventory system is known as "Lateral Resupply" permitting a hospital to satisfy its demand by the other hospitals' inventories in the absence of the required product at the blood center and its excess in any hospital. The proposed mixed-integer mathematical programming model entails three objectives referring to the three underlying concepts of sustainability, additionally, to cope with uncertainties and multi objectiveness, a scenario-based optimization approach and revised multi-choice goal programming technique were employed, respectively. Finally, the results confirmed that the lateral resupply virtue improved the performance indicators.

Design of optimization model for a hydrogen supply chain under emission constraints - A case study of Germany	ENERGY												The increasing global demand for petroleum-based fuels, mainly driven by the economic growth in emerging markets imposes significant challenges in terms of energy supply and environmental mitigation strategies. This work introduces an approach for the design and decision making of primary energy source, production, storage, and distribution networks for hydrogen supply in regions (or countries) under emission constraints. The problem was mathematically represented using a source-sink system approach to determine the most suitable hydrogen supply chain (HSC) network. The optimization problem was formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model using GAMS (R) modeling system. The optimization objective consists of the minimization of the total network cost, both in terms of capital and operating expenditures, subject to: supply, demand, mass conservation, technical performance, economic, and environmental constraints. The model was used to plan the future hydrogen supply chain network for Germany in the year 2030 under emission constraints. The optimization results show that the model is a valuable tool for planning the optimal hydrogen supply chain network of a particular region or country. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, the performance of finger vein recognition systems is limited by insufficient finger vein training samples, which leads to insufficient feature learning and weak model generalization. To solve the above problems, first, we propose a simple and effective finger vein data augmentation strategy named FV-Mix, which uses fine finger vein image region of interest (ROI) for grayscale normalization and linear mixing. It can accomplish exponential-level data augmentation on the training sample, and the augmented data will represent a more complete dataset. Second, a residual Gabor convolutional network (RGCN) is designed for finger vein recognition, which includes a residual Gabor convolutional layer (RGCL) and a dense semantic analysis module (DSAM). The RGCL is designed to replace the shallow convolutional layer in the network by using the characteristics of the Gabor filter to enhance the scale and direction of information in the shallow pattern features. And then, the enhanced deep features are further extracted and analyzed by DSAM, which is used to assist the final model in classifying and recognizing finger vein images. To verify the effectiveness of our work, five publicly available finger vein image datasets are used, and a large number of comparison experiments are designed. The proposed FV-Mix strategy, RGCL module, and DSAM module were fully validated. The experimental results show that on these five datasets, the average recognition accuracy and equal error rate (EER) of the proposed RGCN are 99.22% and 0.188%, respectively, achieves competitive performance compared with current state-of-the-art work.

The single-and double-integral terms in the time derivative of the Lyapunov functional are handled by the reciprocally convex combination and a new integral inequality, respectively. A delay-dependent design criterion is established such that the error system is globally exponentially stable with a decay rate and a prescribed H-infinity performance is guaranteed. The gain matrix and the optimal performance index are obtained via solving a convex optimization problem subject to linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is exploited to demonstrate that much better performance can be achieved by this approach.

The agents in the whole system are interacted with each other through a communication graph structure. Therefore, each agent can only receive the information from itself and its neighbors. Our goal is to design the GrHDP method to achieve consensus control which makes all the agents track the desired dynamics and simultaneously makes the performance indices reach Nash equilibrium. The new local internal reinforcement signals and local performance indices are provided for each agent and the corresponding distributed control laws are designed. Then, GrHDP algorithm is developed to solve the multiagent consensus control problem with the proof of convergence. It is shown that the designed local internal reinforcement signals are bounded signals and the local performance indices can monotonically converge to their optimal values. Moreover, the desired distributed control laws can also achieve optimal. Two simulation studies, including one with four agents and another with ten agents, are applied to validate the theoretical analysis and also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Most existing methods label vehicle behaviours with discrete labels and then use the vehicle trajectories or motion characteristics to train classifiers which identify vehicle behaviours. However, a simple discrete label cannot contain detailed information about the vehicle behaviour. So, inspired by structured learning, the authors design a structured label which is used to characterise the instantaneous behavioural state based on the vehicle image, including behaviour trend and degree simultaneously. A structured convolutional neural networks model is constructed to learn and predict structured representation of transient vehicle behaviour and preliminary experimental results justify the feasibility of vehicle behaviour structural analysis model, but it achieves only 53.3% prediction accuracy. To reduce the risk of overfitting to small-scale training data, the authors further propose an overfitting-preventing deep neural network, which exploits transfer learning and multi-task learning to achieve a much higher prediction accuracy of 91.1%.

The main features include accurately modeled tariff structures and the integration of spatial and temporal consolidation effects via a cyclic pattern expansion. Using several graph-based gadgets, we are able to formulate our problem as a capacitated network design problem. To solve the model, we propose a local search procedure that reroutes flow of multiple commodities at once. Initial solutions are generated by various heuristics, relying on shortest path augmentations and LP techniques. As an important subproblem we identify the optimization of tariff selection on individual links, which we prove to be NP-hard and for which we derive exact as well as fast greedy approaches. We complement our heuristics by lower bounds from an aggregated mixed-integer programming formulation with strengthened inequalities. In a case study from the automotive, chemical, and retail industries, we prove that most of our solutions are within a single-digit percentage of the optimum.

The neural networks have a finite number of modes, and the modes May jump from one to another according to a Markov chain. The main Purpose is to estimate the neuron states, through available Output measurements, Such that for all admissible time-delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is globally asymptotically stable in the mean square. An effective linear matrix inequality approach is developed to solve the neuron state estimation problem. Both the existence conditions and the explicit characterization of the desired estimator are derived. Furthermore, it is shown that the traditional stability analysis issue for delayed neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters can be included as a special case of our main results. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed design method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To make optimal use of the PM material, a highly dynamic control of the stator currents is decisive. Therefore different discrete-time current control algorithms for PMSM drives have been developed, including current state-space and current vector controllers. Nevertheless, classical discrete-time PI controllers with decoupling networks are still frequently applied for control of industrial and electric vehicle drives due to their simple design and high robustness against parameter deviations. In this paper, three different methods for discrete-time current control of a PMSM are compared and tested practically (PI controller, current vector controller and current state-space controller). All controllers performed satisfactorily and robustly against parameter deviations, though their dynamic performance did not meet theoretical expectations. Hence, in the paper a modified discrete-time model for PMSM with pulsewidth modulated stator voltages and symmetrical current sensing is introduced. This model leads to the derivation of a new current vector controller with "true" deadbeat behaviour, which almost meets the theoretically expected control performance.																			2325-0313		978-9-0758-1541-2				2023																								WOS:001098971400053

Additional water curtain boreholes have to be drilled and tested to eliminate any low-efficiency zone. The drilling and testing is, however, a time-consuming and costing job. In this paper, statistical characteristics of fractures (joints, bedding planes, or even faults) obtained at different phases of the project (e.g., site investigation phase and underground excavation phase) are input to a discrete fracture network model to generate realizations representing the fracture network of the considered domain (500mx250mx200m). A grid system is created for the domain with the cell size of 50mx50mx50m. Based on the Cubic Law, a 3D equivalent hydraulic conductivity field is obtained. With the parameter of the Low-Efficiency Index (LEInd), criteria are created to help identify the low-efficiency areas based on the hydraulic conductivity field. The predictions of the low-efficiency zones are then cross checked with the actual water curtain efficiency test results. Four out of five predicted low-efficiency cells were proved to be fully or partly matched with the results identified from the water curtain efficiency test. This work can help to determine the reasonable water curtain borehole layout spacing during the design phase, thus effectively reduce the water curtain boreholes drilling workload after the test, shorten the construction period, and reduce the engineering cost.

The layers in a deep learning model of MixNN are fully decentralized. It hides communication address, layer parameters and operations, and forward as well as backward message flows among non-adjacent layers using the ideas from mix networks. MixNN has the following advantages: (i) an adversary cannot fully control all layers of a model, including the structure and parameters; (ii) even some layers may collude but they cannot tamper with other honest layers; (iii) model privacy is preserved in the training phase. We provide detailed descriptions for deployment. In one classification experiment, we compared a neural network deployed in a virtual machine with the same one using the MixNN design on the AWS EC2. The result shows that our MixNN retains less than 0.001 difference in terms of classification accuracy, while the whole running time of MixNN is about 7.5 times slower than the one running on a single virtual machine.					jin, rui/KHW-6854-2024															1424-8220				NOV	2022	22	21							8254	10.3390/s22218254	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22218254								36365952					WOS:000882208500001

Relaxation of Vitrimers with Kinetically Distinct Mixed Dynamic Bonds	MACROMOLECULES												Designing materials with tunable modulus and viscosity is key for applications such as three-dimensional (3D) printing, sound damping, and wearable devices. Vitrimers provide an ideal platform for viscoelastic design because their dynamic, conserved bond exchange allows for control of both cross-link density and exchange kinetics. Here, multiple boronic acid cross-linkers with different functionalities and kinetics were reacted with silicone diols to form poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) vitrimers. Networks cross-linked with boric acid or two phenyl-substituted boric acids exhibited relaxation times and viscosities within one order of magnitude of each other. Conversely, a cross-linker with nitrogen neighboring groups led to a four order of magnitude acceleration in network relaxation time while still exhibiting a similar modulus to the slower systems. All of these samples demonstrate an increase in moduli with temperature due to entropic elasticity. To understand the effect of more than one dynamic bond on the viscoelastic response, multiple cross-linkers were then combined into a single network and the relaxation spectrum was characterized. The mixed vitrimers exhibit a single relaxation peak, which more closely follows the dynamics of their faster component. These rheological observations are essential for designing complex viscoelastic materials.					; Ewoldt, Randy/N-9067-2013	Evans, Christopher/0000-0003-0668-2500; Porath, Laura E./0000-0001-7113-4530; Ewoldt, Randy/0000-0003-2720-9712													0024-9297	1520-5835				2022 MAY 31	2022										10.1021/acs.macromol.1c02613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c02613		MAY 2022											WOS:000821051200001

We have articulated a set of circuit design alternatives in terms of switch configurations referred to as symmetric and asymmetric designs, and two-layer and three-layer designs and discuss the implications of these alternatives in terms of transmitter and receiver design and synchronization requirements. In order to evaluate performance and cost of this range of design alternatives, we developed a set of software tools and methodologies for designing and dimensioning our vision of an AAPN. The topological design problem consists of determining the optimal number, size and placement of edge nodes, selector/ multiplexers and core switches as well as the placement of the DWDM links so as to minimize network costs while satisfying performance requirements of the supported traffic. A new mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented for core node placement and link connectivity. A methodology has been developed for two-layer and three-layer network topology design and implemented in software. These tools were exercised under a wide variety of equipment cost assumptions for both a metropolitan network and a long-haul network assuming a gravity model for traffic distribution and a flat community of interest factor. Key findings include the determination of near cost optimal designs for both metropolitan (two-layer design) and a Canadian wide area network (WAN, three-layer design). We also show the cost and topology sensitivity to the selector switch size and the preferred size in terms of port count and number of switches. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The coexisting property of a discrete map can be featured by initial-offset-control dynamics. To this end, this article proposes a two-dimensional discrete neuron model with sine activation function. The mechanisms of initial-offset-control coexisting dynamics are theoretically investigated and the homogenous coexisting behaviors are numerically revealed. The results show that the homogenous coexisting attractors are controlled along one direction by one initial-offset and along two directions by two initial-offsets. The former makes it model own finite invariant points, while the latter makes it own infinite invariant points. The homogenous coexisting hyperchaotic attractors are experimentally acquired on field programmable gate array digital platform.

The relatively new neural network structure-Echo state network (ESN) - is used as critic network within ACD scheme. It is trained minimizing temporal difference error using Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. The actor in ACD scheme is trained by associative learning. The proposed approach is tested on optimization of a complex nonlinear process for biopolymer production. The obtained previously results using gradient descent algorithm for actor training are compared with those obtained using heuristic search algorithm and the advantages and shortcomings of both methods are discussed.

The decoder design is based on the concept of self-adjusting decoding graph in which the decoding network is expanded and released frame-synchronously. The fast network expansion and release are made possible by utilizing a novel dynamic network scaffolding layer. The self-adjusting decoding graph is obtained by slicing the traditional decoding network horizontally for separation of different knowledge sources and vertically according to each time instant in search. A two layer hashing structure and an admissible are predication scheme are described. These methods significantly reduce the are mortality rate, a problem which plagues the efficiency of the dynamic decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that an order of magnitude reduction of decoding resources can be achieved based on the proposed approach.																					0-7803-3555-4				1996							2135	2138																WOS:A1996BJ20B00538
J	Garcia, FD; Ritchie, RO; Meyers, MA; Monteiro, SN				Garcia Filho, Fabio Da Costa; Ritchie, Robert O.; Meyers, Marc Andre; Monteiro, Sergio Neves			Cantor-derived medium-entropy alloys: bridging the gap between traditional metallic and high- entropy alloys	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T												The year 2004 marked the beginning of a new era in the design of metallic materials, as the concept of multiple principal component alloys, commonly known as High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs), was proposed by Cantor and Yeh. The unexpected single-phase microstructure, instead of the expected brittle intermetallic compounds, was attributed to the large en-tropy of mixing and immediately caught the attention of the scientific community. Today, HEAs are considered important advanced materials and a broad range of alloys using nominally the same design principle have been investigated. Despite that, the CrMnFeCoNi (Cantor) alloy stands out as the most successful HEA due to its outstanding mechanical properties and microstructure. In this scenario, variants of the Cantor alloy, named medium-entropy alloys (MEAs), are gaining significant interest as they display a better industrial potential than both HEAs and traditional alloys. These variants of the Cantor alloy with only three or four main elements result in 15 possible combinations. The microstructure of these alloys is discussed in terms of advanced characterization as well as thermodynamic parameters and computational simulation. Their phase stability is addressed over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates. The mechanical properties, especially the fracture toughness, of the CrFeCoNi and CrCoNi alloys have been reported to be even superior to those of the Cantor alloy and most modern engineering alloys. This is associated with the formation of a continuous sequence of strengthening mechanisms, including hierarchical twin networks, which serve to prolong the strain hardening. The present article reviews and critically assesses, for the first time, recent advances in these Cantor-derived MEAs.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the authors analyse the stability of S-Aloha in a network environment, such as underwater, where propagation delay and its variance are not negligible. A finite number of unbuffered transmitters are considered. Through mathematical analysis, supported by discrete event simulations, they compare the utilisation and stability with S-Aloha in radio frequency environments where propagation delay, as well as delay variance, are negligible. The comparison results indicate that the stability region is appreciably shifted and also there is a significant decrease of utilisation in the presence of retransmission and distance-dependent propagation delay variability.

Investigation of Input-Output Waveform Engineered Continuous Inverse Class F Power Amplifiers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES												An in-depth analysis of the continuous inverse Class F power amplifier (PA) accounting for nonlinear input and output active device properties is presented. The analyses show possible ways of exploiting input nonlinearity to improve and maintain PA performance in a broadband operation and propose a flexible source second-harmonic design space which reduces the input matching network (MN) design complexities. Such exploitation of input nonlinearity can also alleviate performance degradation due to dynamic knee behavior of a practical field-effect transistor (FET) in continuous inverse Class F PA operation. The analyses are validated with vector load-pull (VLP) measurements and utilized to implement a broadband PA design.

However, limited fronthaul capacity and computation resource have become the bottlenecks inevitably. Thus, this paper investigates the power-efficient transmission in user-centric networks by considering both fronthaul capacity and computation resource constraints, where multiple access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) are distributed. Specifically, a joint optimization of the beamforming vectors, AP-UE association strategy and transmission time is proposed to minimize the total power consumption (TPC). The formulated mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP) is NP-hard. To address this problem, the MINLP is first transformed into a convex one via the successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation methods. Then, an iterative but effective algorithm is designed by using the property of the solution and applying the Lagrangian dual method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly and outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of TPC.

Continuous covering and cooperative covering problems with a general decay function on networks	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY												A cooperative covering location problem anywhere on the networks is analysed. Each facility emits a signal that decays by the distance along the arcs of the network and each node observes the total signal emitted by all facilities. A node is covered if its cumulative signal exceeds a given threshold. The cooperative approach differs from traditional covering models where the signal from the closest facility determines whether or not a point is covered. The objective is to maximize coverage by the best location of facilities anywhere on the network. The problems are formulated and analysed. Optimal algorithms for one or two facilities are proposed.

Then, a novel structure including second and third harmonic control networks as well as intermodulation tuning network intended for higher concurrent-mode efficiency is proposed accompanied by a detailed design methodology. The study has revealed that the performance of concurrent Class-CF dual-band power amplifiers (DB-PAs) under overdrive condition strongly depends on the design space factor. The impact of the device nonlinear output capacitance on the concurrent mode efficiency is also evaluated. To authenticate the validity of the proposed methodology, a Class-CF concurrent dual-band PA operating at 1.842 and 2.655 GHz bands is implemented. Experimental results exhibit output powers of 41.7 and 40.5 dBm and efficiencies of 75% and 72% at the lower and upper bands, respectively, while 62% concurrent-mode efficiency is obtained.

Different from the construction method of full-order state estimator used widely in the complex network, we only need to estimate the unmeasured part of states in the case of the rest are measurable in the real network. By employing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and H-infinity control approach, delay-dependent criteria are established that ensure the existence of the desired estimator gains, and the explicit expression of such estimator gains is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities(LMIs). A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator design scheme.																			1948-9439		978-1-4799-7016-2				2015							657	662																WOS:000375232901135

Stationary states of a dissipative two-qubit quantum channel and their applications for quantum machine learning	QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE												Entangled-state preparation and preservation are the cornerstones of any quantum information platform. However, the strongest adversaries in quantum information science are unwanted environmental effects such as decoherence and dissipation. Here, we address how to control and harness these unwanted effects that arise from the coupling of a system with its environment, to provide stationary entangled states for quantum machine learning (QML). To do so, we design a dissipative quantum channel, i.e., a two-qubit system interacting with a squeezed vacuum field reservoir, and study the output state of the channel by solving the corresponding master equation, especially, in the small squeezing regime. We show that the time-dependent output state of the channel is the so-called two-qubit X-states that generalize many families of entangled two-qubit states. Also, by considering a general Bell diagonal state as the initial state of the system, we reveal that this dissipative channel generates two well-known classes of entangled mixed state and Werner-like states in the steady-state regime. Moreover, this channel provides an efficient way to determine whether a given initial state results in a stationary entangled state or not. Finally, we examine the potential application of the designed two-qubit channel for QML. In this line, we propose a general theoretical scheme for quantum neural networks (QNNs) implemented with the variational quantum circuits, which encode data in continuous variables (CVs) of the two-qubit states. The linear (also referred to as affine) and nonlinear (activation function) transformations are enacted in the QNN using the stationary states of the two-qubit channel and measurement process, respectively. Finally, we proceed to test our proposed model by solving some supervised binary classification tasks. Integrating the non-unitary transformation and parallel-processed neural computing on such a two-qubit channel establishes the requirements for a meaningful QNN. Such a CV-QNN model with sufficient layers may execute any algorithm implementable on a universal CV quantum computer.																			2524-4906	2524-4914				JUN	2023	5	1							13	10.1007/s42484-023-00096-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42484-023-00096-2													WOS:000939594100001

Although cooperative awareness messages provide the required situational awareness for new safety and efficiency applications, they also introduce a new attack vector to compromise privacy. The use of ephemeral credentials called pseudonyms for privacy protection was proposed while ensuring the required security properties. In order to prevent an attacker from linking old to new pseudonyms, mix zones provide a region in which vehicles can covertly change their signing material. In this poster, we extend the idea of mix-zones to mitigate pseudonym linking attacks with a mechanism inspired by chaff-based privacy defense techniques for mix-networks. By providing chaff trajectories, our system restores the efficacy of mix zones to compensate for a lack of vehicles available to participate in the mixing procedure. Our simulation results of a realistic traffic scenario show that a significant improvement is possible.

The objective of the model is to minimize total cost of the network. The model employs risk averseness of retailers to obtain more realistic model regarding uncertain demand. Using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to deal with this uncertainty makes the model to be robust. In this way, data- driven approach is used to avoid any distributional assumptions because realizations of uncertain parameters are the only information obtainable.

J	Gallo, M				Gallo, Mariano			Models, algorithms, and equilibrium conditions for the simulation of autonomous vehicles in exclusive and mixed traffic	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY												This paper proposes models and algorithms for the estimation of traffic flows generated by the centralised management of autonomous vehicles under exclusive and mixed traffic conditions. It is assumed that the autonomous vehicle manager wants to obtain the system optimum that minimises the total travel time on the network, of autonomous vehicles in the case of exclusive traffic, and of all flows in the case of mixed traffic. In the case of mixed traffic, the drivers of the human-guided vehicles choose their routes from a user-optimal perspective; in this case, a fixedpoint problem has to be solved, which represents a state of equilibrium between the flows of human-guided vehicles, the flows of autonomous vehicles, which follow paths aimed at the system optimum, and the link costs. The proposed models and algorithms are tested on a small network with a single origin-destination pair, and on the Sioux Falls network, with different levels of congestion and different percentages of autonomous vehicles. The results show the validity of the proposed methods and the impact of autonomous vehicles on network performance. The proposed static/equilibrium approach is necessary to evaluate transport planning, design or policy interventions that include the presence of autonomous vehicles in traffic flows.																			1569-190X	1878-1462				DEC	2023	129								102838	10.1016/j.simpat.2023.102838	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2023.102838		OCT 2023											WOS:001091688200001

However, when unpredictable disasters such as earthquakes and large-scale power outages attack the optical inter-DC network, it is impossible to predict the network damage under a discrete time domain through the early warning system (EWS). Designing a reliable emergency backup scheme is becoming a key challenge in the optical inter-DC network in unpredictable disasters. Previous work only optimized emergency backup in the optical inter-DC networks in predictable disasters, which would lead to the unreliability of emergency backup of the optical inter-DC networks in unpredictable disasters. Therefore, this work proposes a reliable emergency backup method for the optical inter-DC networks in unpredictable disasters. Firstly, the disaster probability propagation model of the optical inter-DC network in unpredictable disasters is established based on the Markov process to quantify the network damage under a discrete time domain and install the emergency backup reliability problem. Next, constructing a time-sensitive variable time extension network (TS-VTEN) transforms the dynamic emergency backup reliability problem into a static flow problem. Finally, the problem is expressed as integer linear programming (ILP).

Optimized Deep Learning Methods for Crop Yield Prediction	COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Crop yield has been predicted using environmental, land, water, and crop characteristics in a prospective research design. When it comes to predicting crop production, there are a number of factors to consider, including weather conditions, soil qualities, water levels and the location of the farm. A broad variety of algorithms based on deep learning are used to extract useful crops for forecasting. The combination of data mining and deep learning creates a whole crop yield prediction system that is able to connect raw data to predicted crop yields. The suggested study uses a Discrete Deep belief network with Visual Geometry Group (VGG) Net classification method over the tweak chick swarm optimization approach to estimate agricultural production. The Network's successively stacked layers were fed the data parameters. Based on the input parameters, a crop production prediction environment is constructed using the network architecture. Using the tweak chick swarm optimization technique, the best characteristics of input data are preprocessed, and the optimal output is used as input for the classification process. Discrete Deep belief network with the Visual Geometry Group Net classifier is used to classify the data and forecast agricultural production. The suggested model correctly predicts crop output with 97 percent accuracy, exceeding existing models by maintaining the baseline data distribution.

A hybrid binary unified coding description facilitates the optimization process for layout and size variables. The study influences one-dimensional convolutional neural networks to establish an aeroelastic surrogate model, primarily chosen for their exceptional performance in handling multi-parameter aeroelastic regression problems. Additionally, the squirrel optimization algorithm is chosen over the genetic algorithm for the mixed optimization problem, leading to notable savings in computational costs. The research demonstrates that the proposed hybrid optimization method, integrating the one-dimensional convolutional neural network and the squirrel optimization algorithm, offers superior performance in optimizing high aspect ratio wings. Specifically, it results in a reduction of 4.1% in the weight of the wing structure. Moreover, the study highlights the necessity of this hybrid approach due to the observed coupling between the layout variables of the wing ribs and the size variables of the wing beams.																			1895-1767					JAN	2024	25	1			SI					10.12694/scpe.v25i1.2267	http://dx.doi.org/10.12694/scpe.v25i1.2267													WOS:001143994100039

Frank			Performance analysis of serial supply chain networks considering system disruptions	PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL												The supply chain networks could be very fragile in global environment due to unexpected events such as emergencies, normal disruptions and industrial accidents. The supply chain members may lose their production capacities temporarily, which might have significant impacts on the performance of the whole supply chain network. This article proposes a discrete time model to characterise the unreliable production capacity in serial supply chain networks. Based on the proposed model, the exact probability distributions are available for the performance analysis of a single-stage system in the lost sales scenario. The iterative methods are developed to derive the approximate performance measures for single-stage systems in the backorder scenario and multi-stage systems in both the lost sales and backorder scenarios. The proposed methods are verified through a series of numerical experiments. The analysis results suggest that the performance of the supply chain network suffers more from the downstream-stage unreliability than the upstream-stage unreliability. Furthermore, some application examples are illustrated to show the possible solutions for practical problems.

J	Seo, Y; Kook, J				Seo, Youngmin; Kook, Joongjin			DRRU-Net: DCT-Coefficient-Learning RRU-Net for Detecting an Image-Splicing Forgery	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning network (DRRU-Net) for image-splicing forgery detection. DRRU-Net is an architecture that combines RRU-Net for learning the visual content of images and image acquisition artifacts, and a JPEG artifact learning module for learning compression artifacts in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. The backbone model of a network based on pre-training, such as CAT-Net, a representative network for image forgery detection, has a relatively large number of parameters, resulting in overfitting in a small dataset, which hinders generalization performance. Therefore, in this paper, the learning module is designed to learn the characteristics according to the DCT domain in real time without pre-training. In the experiments, the proposed network architecture and training method of DRRU-Net show that the network parameters are smaller than CAT-Net, the forgery detection performance is better than that of RRU-Net, and the generalization performance for various datasets can be improved.																				2076-3417				MAR	2023	13	5							2922	10.3390/app13052922	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app13052922													WOS:000947046500001

Therefore, in this study, we suggest a new technique based on Adaptive Discrete Wavelet Entropy Energy and Neural Network Classifier (ADWEENN) for Recognition of Urine Cells from Microscopic Images Independent of Rotation and Scaling. Some digital image processing methods such as noise reduction, contrast enhancement, segmentation, and morphological process are used for feature extraction stage of this ADWEENN in this study. Nowadays, the image processing and pattern recognition topics have come into prominence. The image processing concludes operation and design of systems that recognize patterns in data sets. In the past years, very difficulty in classification of microscopic images was the deficiency of enough methods to characterize. Lately, it is seen that, multi-resolution image analysis methods such as Gabor filters, discrete wavelet decompositions are superior to other classic methods for analysis of these microscopic images. In this study, the structure of the ADWEENN method composes of four stages. These are preprocessing stage, feature extraction stage, classification stage and testing stage. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and adaptive wavelet entropy and energy is used for adaptive feature extraction in feature extraction stage to strengthen the premium features of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier in this study. Efficiency of the developed ADWEENN method was tested showing that an avarage of 97.58 % recognition succes was obtained.

The proposed model integrates the strategic and tactical decisions to avoid the sub-optimalities led from separated design in both chain networks. The strategic-level decisions relate to the amounts of goods flowing on the forward and reverse chains whereas the tactical-level decisions concern balancing disassembly lines, collection and refurbishing activities in the reverse chain. First, a fuzzy multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model that considers the imprecise nature of critical parameters such as cost coefficients, capacity levels, market demands and reverse rates is proposed. Then, proposed fuzzy model is converted into an auxiliary crisp multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MOMINP) model by applying two different approaches. Finally, different fuzzy interactive programming approaches are applied to solve this MOMINP model to find a satisfactory solution for the network that is considered. The proposed model with the solution approaches is validated through a realistic numerical example. Computational results indicate that our proposed model and solution approaches can effectively be used in CLSC network problems.

It is assumed that the switching information can be collected by a tracker with a certain probability and transmitted from the tracker to controller precisely. Then the controller selects suitable control gains based on the received switching information to synchronize the network. This new control scheme makes full use of received information and overcomes the shortcomings of mode-dependent and mode-independent control schemes. Moreover, the proposed control method includes both the mode-dependent and mode-independent control techniques as special cases. By using linear matrix inequality (LMI) method and designing new Lyapunov functionals, delay-dependent conditions are derived to guarantee that the DTNNs with Markov jump topologies to be asymptotically synchronized. Compared with existing results on Markov systems which are obtained by separately using mode-dependent and mode-independent methods, our result has great flexibility in practical applications. Numerical simulations are finally given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They compete with each other for limited network resources, and the effective scheduling of such mix-flows is extremely challenging. We propose a deep reinforcement learning with private link approach (DRL-PLink), which combines the software-defined network and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to schedule mix-flows. DRL-PLink divides the link bandwidth and establishes some corresponding private-links for different types of flows to isolate them such that the competition among different types of flows can decrease accordingly. DRL is used to adaptively and intelligently allocate bandwidth resources for these private-links. Furthermore, to improve the scheduling policy, DRL-PLink introduces the novel clipped double Q-learning, exploration with noise, and prioritized experience replay technology for DDPG to address function approximation error, to induce lager and more randomness for exploration, as well as more effective and efficient experience replay in DRL respectively. The experiment results under actual datacenter network workloads (including Web search and data mining workload) indicate that DRL-PLink can effectively schedule mix-flows at a small system overhead. Compared with ECMP, pFabric, and Karuna, the average flow completion time of DRL-PLink decreased by 77.79%, 65.61%, and 23.34% respectively, when the deadline meet rate is increased by 16.27%, 0.02%, and 0.836% respectively. Additionally, DRL-PLink can also well achieve load balance between paths.						lu, jin jie/0000-0003-2503-6416													1932-4537					JUN	2022	19	2					1049	1064		10.1109/TNSM.2021.3128267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2021.3128267													WOS:000809410600021

To flexibly serve diverse traffic, various functional split options (FSOs) are specified by 5G protocols enabling different network functions. In order to improve signal qualities for edge users, we consider flexible FSO (FFS) based coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission as a prominent technique capable of supporting high traffic demands. However, due to conventional confined hardware processing capability, a processor sharing (PS) model is introduced to deal with high latency for multi-service FSO-based networks. Therefore, it becomes essential to assign CoMP-enhanced functional split modes under PS model. A more tractable FSO-based network in terms of ergodic rate and reliability is derived by stochastic geometry approach. Moreover, we have proposed CoMP-enhanced functional split mode allocation (CFSMA) scheme to adaptively assign FSOs to provide enhanced mixed throughput and latency-aware services. The simulation results have validated analytical derivation and demonstrated that the proposed CFSMA scheme optimizes system spectrum efficiency while guaranteeing stringent latency requirement. The proposed CFSMA scheme with the designed PS FFS-CoMP system outperforms the benchmarks of conventional FCFS scheduling, non-FSO network, fixed FSOs, and limited available FSO selections in open literature.

J	Meng, H; Yuan, F; Tian, Y; Wei, HW				Meng, Hao; Yuan, Fei; Tian, Yang; Wei, Hongwei			A Ship Detection Method in Complex Background Via Mixed Attention Model	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												With the development of deep learning, recent object detection methods have made considerable progress. Unlike other simple visual object detection problems, it is more difficult to detect ships in a complex background. Nearshore vessels are always confused with background objects. When the ship target is small, the feature information in the background will greatly interfere with the information extraction and learning of the target area of the ship by the convolution neural network, resulting in the problem of ship sample imbalance. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a mixed attention model to decrease the difficulty of ship detection, which is composed of pixel attention model (PAM) and feature attention model (FAM). The PAM structure is a generative adversarial network designed to prove the sensitivity of the target area without extra manual works. FAM is a convolution network designed to increase the utilization rate of useful features. While MAM is not a fixed structure, it could be implanted into almost any object detection and classification networks. Meanwhile, PAM is for the original image preprocessing part and FAM is always added to the position of low-level features to high-level features. Following experimental results show that using MAM method into Yolov3, the mean average precision increased by 2.2% when achieved 0.975, which effectively improve the accuracy of ship detection in complex background.																			2193-567X	2191-4281				AUG	2022	47	8					9505	9525		10.1007/s13369-021-06275-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-021-06275-2		OCT 2021											WOS:000712946700001

In software engineering there are "continuous" stages that are used depending on the number of artifact repositories such as databases, meta data, virtual machines, networks and servers, various logs, and reports. Augmented Reality (AR) technology is currently growing rapidly. We can find this technology in various fields of life, but unfortunately sustainable software engineering for Augmented Reality is not found. The method shown in previous research is a general method in software engineering so that a theory is needed for sustainable software engineering for AR considering that AR is not just an ordinary application but there are 3D elements and specific components that must be met so that it can be called AR. The main idea behind this research is to find a continuous pattern from the stages of the existing method so far. For example, in general the stages of system development are planning, analysis, design, implementation and maintenance. Then after the application has been built, does it finish there? As we know software always grows and develops according to human needs. Therefore, there are continuous stages that must be patterned so that the life cycle process can be maintained. In this paper we present our initial findings about the continuous stages of continuous software engineering namely continuous planning, continuous analysis, continuous design, continuous programming, continuous integration, and continuous maintenance.																			2158-107X	2156-5570				JUL	2023	14	7					174	181																WOS:001047169500001

The network measurement outputs obtained by two groups of sensors are transmitted to two remote subestimators via two independent communication channels, respectively. To lighten the communication loads of the networks and reduce the occurrence rate of data collisions, two RR protocols are utilized to orchestrate the transmission orders of sensor nodes in two groups, respectively. The error dynamics of the state estimation is governed by a switched system with periodic switching parameters. By constructing a transmission-order-dependent Lyapunov-like functional and utilizing the up-to-date discrete Wirtinger-based inequality together with the reciprocally convex approach, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the exponentially ultimate boundedness of the estimation error dynamics in mean square with a prescribed upper bound on the decay rate. An asymptotic upper bound of the outputs of the estimation errors in mean square is derived and the estimator parameters are then obtained by minimizing such an upper bound subject to linear matrix inequality constraints. The repressilator model is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed estimator.					liu, xiao/HKE-9880-2023; liu, xiao/HMD-7454-2023; Wang, Zidong/H-1523-2011; Liu, Xiaohui/B-5046-2013	Wang, Zidong/0000-0002-9576-7401; Wu, Min/0000-0002-0668-8315													1536-1241	1558-2639				APR	2018	17	2					145	154		10.1109/TNB.2018.2797124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2018.2797124								29870338					WOS:000434288000007

[3] we consider selective network design on bottleneck routing games. Assuming P not equal NP we achieve the following results. For the unsplittable bottleneck games the trivial algorithm is a best possible approximation algorithm. For the k-splittable unweighted bottleneck games it is NP-hard to compute a best pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Moreover no polynomial time algorithms can have a constant approximation ratio if the edge latency functions are continuous and non-decreasing.

J	Wang, QL; Sun, CY				Wang, Qingling; Sun, Changyin			A continuous distributed control algorithm for time-varying networks of nonlinear agents with input saturation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												In this article, we explore the possibility of designing a continuous control algorithm for time-varying networks of high-order nonlinear agents with input saturation. A class of neural network-based (NN) distributed control algorithms are proposed for the consensus of nonlinear agents with input saturation and nonidentical unknown control directions (UCDs) under uniformly quasi-strongly delta-connected graphs. An NN is used to cancel the unknown part of agent dynamics due to the well known NN function approximation property. Also, an adaptive smooth term is employed to compensate for the bounded disturbance, the approximation error. Moreover, an auxiliary system is designed to counteract the effect of input saturation. Furthermore, the control law is augmented with the Nussbaum-type function to obtain an estimation of the UCDs. It is proven rigorously that the consensus of nonlinear agents with input saturation and nonidentical UCDs can be guaranteed, and the boundedness of all signals of closed-loop systems is ensured. Finally, simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Exploring potential bio-inspired improvements, we note a number of neuronal network models have demonstrated some success in classifying static datasets by abstracting the insect olfactory system. However, these designs remain largely unproven in practical settings, where sensor data is real-time, continuous, potentially noisy, lacks a precise onset signal and accurate classification requires the inclusion of temporal aspects into the feature set. This investigation therefore seeks to inform and develop the potential and suitability of biomimetic classifiers for use with typical real-world sensor data. Taking a generic classifier design inspired by the inhibition and competition in the insect antennal lobe, we apply it to identifying 20 individual chemical odours from the timeseries of responses of metal oxide sensors. We show that four out of twelve available sensors and the first 30 s (10%) of the sensors' continuous response are sufficient to deliver 92% accurate classification without access to an odour onset signal. In contrast to previous approaches, once training is complete, sensor signals can be fed continuously into the classifier without requiring discretization. We conclude that for continuous data there may be a conceptual advantage in using spiking networks, in particular where time is an essential component of computation. Classification was achieved in real time using a GPU-accelerated spiking neural network simulator developed in our group.

Due to its importance, many predictive models are designed by utilizing machine learning algorithms. The models are well designed to show high performances in detecting abnormal internet traffic behaviors. However, they may not guarantee reliable detection performances for new incoming abnormal internet traffic because they are designed using raw features from imbalanced internet traffic data. Since internet traffic is non-stationary time-series data, it is difficult to identify abnormal internet traffic with the raw features. In this study, we propose a new approach to detecting abnormal internet traffic. Our approach begins with extracting hidden, but important, features by utilizing discrete wavelet transformation. Then, statistical analysis is performed to filter out irrelevant and less important features. Only statistically significant features are used to design a reliable predictive model with logistic regression. A comparative analysis is conducted to determine the importance of our approach by measuring accuracy, sensitivity, and the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve. From the analysis, we found that our model detects abnormal internet traffic successfully with high accuracy.

First, the required impedance condition of the carrier amplifier which operates in continuous class-J mode at the back-off region is analyzed in detail. Based on the proposed theory, the fundamental impedance is realized by taking advantage of the noninfinity output impedance of the peaking stage, then the second harmonic impedance is realized with a harmonic tuning postmatching network. A 1.8-/2.6-GHz dual-band DPA employing commercial GaN devices is designed and implemented to validate the proposed method. The fabricated DPA can achieve 68.5% and 75% drain efficiencies (DEs) for saturated power level at 1.8 and 2.6 GHz, respectively. For the 6-dB back-off region, the measured DEs are 64% and 63% at the two designed frequencies.

Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of continuous processing, traditional experiment-based approaches are often time-consuming and inefficient. In this review, model-assisted approaches were focused and their applications in continuous chromatography process development, validation and control were discussed. Chromatographic models are useful in describing particular process performances of continuous capture and polishing with multi-column chromatography. Model-assisted tools showed powerful ability in evaluating multiple operating parameters and identifying optimal points over the entire design space. The residence time distribution models, model-assisted process analytical technologies and model-predictive control strategies were also developed to reveal the propagation of disturbances, enhance real time monitor and achieve adaptive control to match the transient disturbances and deviations of continuous processes. Moreover, artificial neural networks and machine learning concepts were integrated into modeling approaches to improve data treatment. In general, further development in research and applications of model-assisted approaches for continuous chromatography are needed urgently to support the continuous manufacturing.

Distributed impulsive observers, which possess the advantage of reducing the communication load among NNs nodes, are designed to observe the NNs state. The impulsive controller is proposed to improve the efficiency of the controller. An impulsive augmented error system (IAES) is obtained based on the matrix Kronecker product. A sufficient condition is established to ensure synchronization of the group of NNs by proving the stability of the IAES. An iterative algorithm is given to obtain a suboptimal allowed interval of the impulsive signal, and the corresponding gains of the observer and the controller are derived. The developed result is illustrated by a numerical example.																			2162-237X	2162-2388				OCT	2020	31	10					3777	3787		10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2946151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2946151								31751287					WOS:000576436600001

Such an RNN is designed based on a matrix-valued error function instead of a scalar-valued error function. In addition, it was depicted in an implicit dynamics instead of an explicit dynamics. In this paper, we develop and investigate a discrete-time model of Zhang neural network (termed as such and abbreviated as ZNN for presentation convenience), which is depicted by a system of difference equations. Comparing with Newton iteration for matrix inversion, we find that the discrete-time ZNN model incorporates Newton iteration as its special case. Noticing this relation, we perform numerical comparisons on different situations of using ZNN and Newton iteration for matrix inversion. Different kinds of activation functions and different step-size values are examined for superior convergence and better stability of ZNN. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of both ZNN and Newton iteration for online matrix inversion.

It has been demonstrated that neural network training provides an efficient approach to estimate the complex system reliability function. When executing the neural network algorithm, there are many parameters that need to be determined for improving the training performance. Therefore, robust experimental design method can be used to determine the neural network parameters. The traditional robust design methods are intended for a single response variable. However, the application of neural network method includes more than one measurement, such as estimation accuracy and time efficiency. In this paper, utility function is first estimated by neural network training, in which the algorithm parameters are determined by weighted principal component (WPCA)-based multi-response optimization which simultaneously optimizes more than one training performance measurements. Moreover, it is always desirable to simultaneously optimize several objectives in designing a system, such as reliability, cost, etc. Therefore, continuous WPCA-based multi-response design is then applied to obtain the best design of redundancies in RAP, which simultaneously optimize multiple objectives by taking into account the correlations between them.																			0218-5393	1793-6446				OCT	2017	24	5								10.1142/S0218539317500243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218539317500243													WOS:000411823100004

The considered objective function is the total annualized cost, including the investment and operating costs. The binary variables used to represent the flow direction of pipelines lead to a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, solved by using the standard branch and bound solver in GAMS. The optimization strategy provides the main design parameters of the pipelines (diameters, pressures, and flow rates) and the characteristics of compressor stations (location, suction pressure, pressure ratio, station throughput, fuel consumption, and station power consumption) to satisfy customer requirements.

First, a new event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to determine whether or not the current sampled sensor data should be broad-casted and transmitted to the quantizer, which can save the limited communication resource. Second, a novel communication framework is employed by the logarithmic quantizer that quantifies and reduces the data transmission rate in the network, which apparently improves the communication efficiency of networks. Third, a stabilization criterion is derived based on the sufficient condition which guarantees a prescribed H-infinity performance level in the estimation error system in terms of the linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the correctness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interfirm collaboration for knowledge resources interaction among small innovative firms	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH												For innovative SMEs, acquiring knowledge resources may serve as an important source to enhance their knowledge base of management practices. In line with the resource interaction approach, an essential way to do this is to participate in informal interfirm networks. Yet, researchers have only given cursory attention to resource exchange in cooperative networks. This study examines the structural, relational, and motivational drivers that lead firms to establish informal networks of relationships to find, exchange, and combine knowledge resources. Following a mixed methods research design using interview data and social network data, the study demonstrates that informal networks play a pivotal role for SMEs to capture valuable resources increasing their knowledge stock, forge organizational standing, and gain social connectivity through reciprocity. This research implies that knowledge as a resource transcends the individual organization, which offers implications for resource interaction in inter-organizational knowledge networks and management practice.

J	Vila, JP; Wagner, V				Vila, JP; Wagner, V			Predictive neuro-control of uncertain systems: design and use of a neuro-optimizer	AUTOMATICA												We consider the problem of predictive control of uncertain stochastic discrete I/O systems. Given a model identification procedure able to give accurate output system estimates, e.g. a neural network approximation, we use another feedforward neural network to generate at each time step a constrained optimal control. Dynamic backpropagation is used to improve when necessary the controller network parameters. Both system and controller neural structures are first selected off-line by a statistical Bayesian procedure in order to make the predictive control minimizing process more efficient. The issue of stochastic stability of the closed-loop is considered. We developed this approach for the tracking control of such uncertain systems as biotechnological processes.

J	Angulo, E; García-Ródenas, R; Espinosa-Aranda, JL				Angulo, Eusebio; Garcia-Rodenas, Ricardo; Luis Espinosa-Aranda, Jose			A Lagrangian relaxation approach for expansion of a highway network	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH												This paper deals with the problem of improving an existing road network in the context of strategic planning through the creation of new highway corridors. To address this problem we analyse three mixed integer programming models. The so-called [P1] is the classical capacitated multicommodity network design model. The model named [P2] imposes on [P1] the location of a single (main path) highway corridor in the road network and [P3] adds to [P2] a set of sub-tour breaking constraints. The stated goal is to minimize the total travel time for a known origin-destination demand matrix with a given budget. In this paper we propose an efficient method for [P3], based on a Lagrangian relaxation, to obtain easily-solved sub-problems. A cutting-plane method for solving the Lagrangian sub-problems is proposed. This method generates valid cuts until an optimal solution is found. The Lagrangian dual problem is solved using the sub-gradient optimization method. A case study has been carried out for the region of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). Computational comparisons between the proposed method and a state-of-the-art mixed-integer code are presented. The Lagrangian relaxation approach is found to be capable of generating good feasible solutions to the case study within a reasonable computational time.

Existing studies have proposed the metric age of information (AoI) to quantify freshness and have system designs that achieve low AoI. However, despite active research in this area, existing results are not applicable to general wired networks for two reasons. First, they focus on wireless settings, where AoI is mostly affected by interference and collision, while queueing issues are more prevalent in wired settings. Second, traditional high-throughput/low-latency legacy drop-adverse (LDA) flows are not taken into account in most system designs; hence, the problem of scheduling mixed flows with distinct performance objectives is not addressed. In this article, we propose a hierarchical system design to treat wired networks shared by mixed flow traffic, specifically LDA and AoI flows, and study the characteristics of achieving a good tradeoff between throughput and AoI. Our approach to the problem consists of two layers: freshness-aware traffic engineering (FATE) and in-network freshness control (IFC). The centralized FATE solution studies the characteristics of the source flow to derive the sending rate/update frequency for flows via the optimization problem LDA-AoI Coscheduling. The parameters specified by FATE are then distributed to IFC, which is implemented at each outport of the network's nodes and used for efficient scheduling between LDA and AoI flows. We present a Linux implementation of IFC and demonstrate the effectiveness of FATE/IFC through extensive emulations. Our results show that it is possible to trade a little throughput (5% lower) for much shorter AoI (49% to 71% shorter) compared to state-of-the-art traffic engineering.

Swarm optimisation algorithms applied to large balanced communication networks	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS												In the last years, several combinatorial optimisation problems have arisen in the computer communications networking field. In many cases, for solving these problems it is necessary the use of meta-heuristics. An important problem in communication networks is the Terminal Assignment Problem (TAP). Our goal is to minimise the link cost of large balanced communication networks. TAP is a NP-Hard problem. The intractability of this problem is the motivation for the pursuits of Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms that produce approximate, rather than exact, solutions. This paper makes a comparison among the effectiveness of three SI algorithms: Ant Colony Optimisation, Discrete Particle Swarm Optimisation and Artificial Bee Colony. We also compare the SI algorithms with several algorithms from literature. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results show that SI algorithms provide good solutions in a better running time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Global <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> Consensus of Linear Multi-agent Systems with Input Saturation	2016 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)	Proceedings of the American Control Conference				American Control Conference (ACC)	JUL 06-08, 2016	Boston, MA	Amer Automat Control Council				This paper deals with the problem of global consensus of a network of agents corresponding to identical linear continuous-time systems within a fully connected network and in the presence of saturation. In particular, each agent exchanges a linear input through the network and is subject to input magnitude saturation and a disturbance signal. The mismatch among the external disturbances is supposed to be bounded in energy and then a saturated H-infinity control design problem is addressed and solved. A decentralized dynamic output feedback control law is designed through linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions that induces the global consensus, a certified local convergence rate and a certified global nonlinear H-infinity performance. The results are illustrated in a simulation example.																			0743-1619		978-1-4673-8682-1				2016							6272	6277																WOS:000388376106054

Dynamics of analog logic-gate networks for machine learning	CHAOS												We describe the continuous-time dynamics of networks implemented on Field Programable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The networks can perform Boolean operations when the FPGA is in the clocked (digital) mode; however, we run the programed FPGA in the unclocked (analog) mode. Our motivation is to use these FPGA networks as ultrafast machine-learning processors, using the technique of reservoir computing. We study both the undriven dynamics and the input response of these networks as we vary network design parameters, and we relate the dynamics to accuracy on two machine-learning tasks.

J	Huang, YZ				Huang, Yuzhu			Neuro-observer based online finite-horizon optimal control for uncertain non-linear continuous-time systems	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												In this study, within framework of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), a neuro-observer based online optimal control solution is developed for the finite-horizon optimal control problem of uncertain non-linear continuous-time systems. First, a neuro-observer is designed to estimate system states from the uncertain system without knowledge of system drift dynamics. Then based on the observed states, an online finite-horizon optimal control scheme is proposed by a single critic network to approximate the solution of the time-varying Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and obtain the optimal control. In the design, a novel observer-critic architecture is presented for implementing the control scheme by using two neural networks (NNs): an observer NN is used to learn the uncertain system dynamics and a critic NN is employed not only to approximate the solution of time-varying HJB equation, but also to ensure the terminal constraint is satisfied. Besides, an additional adjusting term is introduced by Lyapunov theory in critic NN weight tuning algorithm, which relaxes the requirement for an initial stabilising control. Moreover, uniform ultimate bounded stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed via Lyapunov's direct method. Finally, simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				FEB 3	2017	11	3					401	410		10.1049/iet-cta.2016.0966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2016.0966													WOS:000394430100011

SIGNIFICATIVE EXPERIENCES TO DEVELOP TEACHERS' DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION	13TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2019)	INTED Proceedings				13th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 11-13, 2019	Valencia, SPAIN					For more than 25 years, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have been integrated in Higher Education in order to implement new methodologies and assessment models, develop virtual programs, and support research, knowledge transfer and education management. Therefore, the academic staff have experienced the need to develop their teachers' digital competence. Several studies of the Ibero-American context identified a general basic to medium level of teacher's digital competence; the training needs were mainly focused on the pedagogical, communication and professional development areas. Moreover, the trend of this research field is mainly characterized by a quantitative approach for diagnostic and evaluation purposes. Thus, the challenge of a complementary understanding of the dynamic and qualitative nature of this competence is recognized, based on a critical perspective about education and ICT and the framework of teacher professional development. The ongoing research aims to characterize the development in practice of the teacher's digital competence in Higher Education. From a qualitative perspective, the biographical method has oriented the approach to the professional life stories of university teachers in Mexico and Spain. In the preliminary phase of analysis, relevant experiences that have helped teachers to foster this competence have been identified. These were: the development of digital content and tools for student's learning, the participation and design of blended and virtual courses, digital identity and the production of content about academic projects in open platforms, the coordination of inter-institutional and mixed networks, the guidance or tutorship of students in social projects, and the design and assessment of educational projects with ICT. Also, some emergent categories arose: meanings of the use of technology, continuous learning strategies and difficulties in the process, as well as some issues about the interpretation of the data. Finally, the need to consider the complex nature of this competence is pointed out. The development of this competence not only implies the teachers' practice, but also requires institutional support and a general commitment about the opportunities and challenges for the transformation of the university and the dialogue with digital cultures.

In mixed-criticality systems, a shared memory can be realized on top of time-triggered message passing to effectively support heterogeneous applications with different interaction paradigms. This paper presents a simulation environment of such an MPSoC combining message-based and shared-memory interactions. We present SystemC simulation building blocks for the application cores, network interfaces and the time-triggered network-on-a-chip. The behavior of the application cores is described by Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM). We generate traces from the application software or from benchmarks, which serve as input for the access to the network interfaces. The simulation framework is evaluated using a realistic case study based on SPLASH-2 and PARSEC application benchmarks. The simulation framework is essential for early validation and design space exploration of mixed-criticality systems. The high abstraction level provided by TLM and traces ensures high simulation speeds.																					978-1-4673-7888-8				2015																								WOS:000380448300022

The considered QVNNs model are treated as a whole, rather than as complex-valued neural networks (NNs) or four real-valued NNs. Using the vector Lyapunov function method, some criteria are provided for securing the mean-square exponential stability of the mixed-delay QVNNs under impulsive and stochastic disturbances. Furthermore, a type of chaotic QVNNs under stochastic and impulsive disturbances is considered using a previously established stability analysis method. After the completion of designing the linear feedback control law, some sufficient conditions are obtained using the vector Lyapunov function method for determining the mean-square exponential synchronization of drive-response systems. Finally, two examples are provided to demonstrate the correctness and feasibility of the main findings and one example is provided to validate the use of QVNNs for image associative memory.

However, different kinds of (personal and organisational) interests will affect collaboration in integrated dementia care (IDC) networks. Hence, it is crucial to understand how interests influence relations in IDC-networks in order to shape future policies.Methods: A sequential mixed methods single case study design was used, in three phases: a Social Network Analysis (SNA) based on data from questionnaires (n = 24-26), explorative interviews with network partners (n = 14) and a focus group with network coordinators (n = 7) to explore the conceptual generalisability of the single case of the IDC-network.Results: The SNA revealed that highly connected organisations were often established care organisations that deliver case management, while smaller care organisations or welfare organisations tend to be less connected. Care-related, strategic, and financial interests influence participation of organisations in the IDC-network, while personal intrinsic motivations determine a representative's contribution to the network. Especially conflicting interests strongly influence the network structure.Discussion and conclusion: We conclude that conflicting interests in IDC-networks stand in the way of reaching the collective goal of an IDC-network, i.e., optimising the wellbeing of people with dementia and their informal caregivers in the region. Thus, IDC-networks should act to manage, resolve and prevent disputes arising from conflicting interests.

Nevertheless, many advanced works focus on first-order attention design, e.g. channels and spatial attention, but ignore higher-order attention mechanisms. In this work, we propose the Mixed High-Order Attention (MHA) module to model the complex and high-order information in the attention mechanism, which captures the subtle texture and outputs the discriminative attention map. Besides, the region of the convolution is local, which can't capture global context and long-range dependencies. Therefore, we propose a non-local block to obtain global attention features.

J	Elias, J				Elias, Jocelyne			Optimal design of energy-efficient and cost-effective wireless body area networks	AD HOC NETWORKS												Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) represent one of the most promising approaches for improving the quality of life, allowing remote patient monitoring and other healthcare applications. The deployment of a WBAN is a critical issue that impacts both the network lifetime and the total energy consumed by the network. This work investigates the optimal design of wireless body area networks by studying the joint data routing and relay positioning problem, in order to increase the network lifetime. To this end, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model, the Energy-Aware WBAN Design model, which optimizes the number and location of relays to be deployed and the data routing towards the sink, minimizing both the network installation cost and the energy consumed by wireless sensors and relays. We solve the proposed model in both realistic WBAN scenarios and general topologies, and compare the model performance to the most notable approaches proposed in the literature. Numerical results demonstrate that our model (1) provides a good tradeoff between the energy consumption and the number of installed relays, and (2) designs energy-efficient and cost-effective WBANs in a short computation time, thus representing an interesting framework for the dynamic WBAN design problem.

A novel formulation for exact sensitivities is achieved by defining an adjoint of a dynamic neural network (DNN). We further present an in-depth description of how our ADNN is computationally linked with the original DNN in the transient-simulation environment in order to improve the efficiency of solving the ADNN. Using ADNN-enabled sensitivities, we develop a new training algorithm that facilitates DNN learning of nonlinear transients directly from continuous time-domain waveform data. The proposed algorithm is also expanded to enable physics-based nonlinear circuit CAD through faster sensitivity computations. Applications of our ADNN approach in transient modeling and circuit design are demonstrated by the examples of modeling physics-based high-speed interconnect drivers and gradient-based signal integrity optimization.

Optimization of sewer networks using the mixed-integer linear programming	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												This paper introduces a method for optimizing sewer networks using the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for a given layout. The objective function is defined as the sum of the costs for pipe purchase, pipe-laying, and manhole construction expressed in linear terms and subject to minimum and maximum allowable slopes, velocities, and relative depths for both minimum and maximum sewage discharge rates in each pipe. Additionally, provisions are made as constraints or conditions to ensure that a minimum pipe cover is required, that pipe diameters do not decrease in the flow direction, and that pipes maintain a steady elevation at each manhole. All the non-linear constraints are transformed into the linear format. Pipe slope, binary variables accounting for commercial pipe diameters and average implemented depths have also been considered as decision variables.

Stereo orthogonal design is made up by stereo orthogonal algorithm and nerve network algorithm. Through essentially reforming planar orthogonal table, this paper presents for the first time a kind of Stereo orthogonal table that is generated by planar orthogonal table. Because each factor in stereo orthogonal table is not continuous, and the relation between factors and the indexes does not know, the relation between experimental factors and indexes is a problem of "black box". This kind of problem can establish the system model through the nerve network. Nerve network model sample database can be established by measured experiment data through a real object or the similarity model experiment or by measured engineering data in actual production. The nerve network that has been trained can be applied to carry on mathematics' experiment. After having variance analysis in experimental results, optimum combination of elements can be determined. The proof test is done on 2ZS1848 type dewatering screen about this experimental method. The experiment result indicates the designed parameter agree with actual the work condition. That proves this method has the higher practicability.																					7-5062-7445-0				2005							1661	1664																WOS:000232030701172

The phase behavior of binary mixtures of alkylated DBAs at the solid liquid interface can be predicted by the 2D isomorphism coefficient. In addition, we also investigated the influence of coadsorption of template molecules on the phase behavior of DBA mixtures. Coadsorption of these molecules significantly promotes mixing of DBAs, possibly by affecting the recognition between alkyl chains. Monte Carlo simulations prove that the 2D isomorphism coefficient can predict the phase behavior at the interface. These results are helpful for the understanding of phase behavior of complex assembling systems and also for the design of programmable porous networks and hierarchical architectures at the solid-liquid interface.

Mechanical models can be set up based on discontinuity network models; and then fine numerical simulating work can be carried out, which is an attractive direction in rock mechanics.

The signal is subjected to continuous wavelet transform after the first-order difference, which can effectively improve the resolution of the time-frequency feature images. The parallel fusion residual block (PFRB) is constructed, and the number of PFRBs can be selected adaptively based on the data features, thus enhancing the learning capability of the features. An attentional feature fusion layer is designed. This layer locates the fault features extracted by the previous layer through the attention mechanism. Through the feature fusion mechanism, the effective fault information is fused to achieve feature augmentation inside the network. The experimental results show that the proposed method has superior diagnostic performance compared with other methods in bearing and gearbox gear faults.

Railway infrastructure is represented by a network consisting of nodes and arcs. The nodes represent stations; the arcs lines connecting the stations. An input instance of the network design problem for railway infrastructure consists of two parts. The stations, which have to be connected in a certain way, and a traffic demand, which relates each pair of nodes (A, B) to a number of trains of different types, has to be routed from A to B in a given time horizon. A newly designed network answers two questions: what is the topology of the network, i.e. which stations are connected to each other and how does the line look like in each connection (e.g. single track, double track, single track with one overtaking station etc.)? The observed kind of routing problem can be stated and solved as a multi-commodity flow problem. In order to get the design of the network using a routing routine, a complete network is constructed. Finding a routing in such a complete network is then equal to designing the network, since the routing chooses the arcs needed and so designs the desired network. To solve the problem efficiently it is stated as a mixed integer program (MIP), which is solvable by standard MIP-solvers.																			1746-4498		978-1-84564-468-0				2010	114						395	405		10.2495/CR100371	http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/CR100371													WOS:000303780200037

Each node is equipped with a fixed-tuned transmitter, a tunable transmitter, a fixed-tuned receiver, and a tunable receiver. The proposed protocol alleviates the drawbacks of a previous protocol [1], e.g., invalid data transmissions that follows receiver collisions and possible acknowledgment packet collisions with header/data packets, while retaining many advantages. As a result, the network performance in terms of throughput and packet delay is improved. Analytical models based on the timing diagram analysis, the continuous-time Markov chain, and the randomization technique are developed to assess the proposed protocol, and are validated through event-driven simulation. The performance is evaluated in terms of channel utilization, mean packet delay, and packet delay distribution with variations in the number of nodes, the offered traffic, the size of data packets, and the network propagation delay. Through numerical results and simulation studies, we show that the proposed protocol achieves better channel utilization and incurs lower packet delays.																			1387-974X	1572-8188				NOV	2003	6	3					289	308		10.1023/A:1025683523691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025683523691													WOS:000185138900008

In this paper, we will particularly focus on the mixed deployment of macro and pico cells. Co-channel deployment is typically assumed for heterogenous network to make the best use of spectrum resource; therefore, a critical issue for heterogenous network is co-channel interference between macro and pico cells, which, if not properly addressed, may significantly degrade the performance of heterogenous network. Furthermore, other deployment options, e. g., the number and the positions of pico nodes will also affect system performance greatly. In this paper, we will carry out extensive simulation campaigns to evaluate the downlink and uplink performance of co-channel macro-pico heterogeneous network. Results show that huge performance benefit can be obtained if heterogenous network is well designed and parameterized.

J	AHLUWALIA, AK; SINGHAL, M				AHLUWALIA, AK; SINGHAL, M			PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF THE COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURE OF THE CONNECTION MACHINE	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS												The Connection Machine CM-2 exhibits massive parallelism and can support several forms of interprocessor communications. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the interprocessor communication architecture of the CM-2. A discrete-time Markov chain model of the network architecture of the CM-2 is developed to compute the message delay introduced by the network architecture. Due to "synchronous time-division multiplexing" nature of the operation of the communication network, it is amenable to a discrete-time Markov chain modeling. Besides response time, the analysis yields formulas for several other related performance measures. These formulas indicate how the performance of the communication network of the CM-2 degrades with the message arrival rate and other parameters of the network architecture. Since the communication delays affect the interprocess communication in an application running on the CM-2, the knowledge of the sensitivity of the delays with the parameters can be a useful aid in designing a high performance parallel system. To keep the analysis tractable, we made some simplifying assumptions. Due to the largeness of the Markov model, an approximate Markov model is used that requires the use of "fixed-point iteration" to solve it. Validation of the analytical results against a simulation study reveals that the analysis presented in this paper predicts the performance of the communication network with high accuracy.																			1045-9219					NOV	1992	3	6					728	738		10.1109/71.180627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/71.180627													WOS:A1992KD23300008

Norm-bounded uncertainties, stochastic disturbances and time-varying delays are considered in the discrete-time stochastic GRNs. Meantime, the measurement delays of GRNs are described by a binary switching sequence satisfying a conditional probability distribution. The main purpose is to design a linear estimator to approximate the true concentrations of the mRNA and the protein through the available measurement outputs. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are first established to ensure the existence of the desired estimators in the terms of a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Then, the explicit expression. of the desired estimator is shown to ensure the estimation error dynamics to be robustly exponentially stable in the mean square and a prescribed H-infinity disturbance rejection attenuation is guaranteed for the addressed system. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By adopting a well-defined accessibility measure, this paper studies a new discrete network design problem for metropolitan areas, in which some concepts, including the accessible flow, travel time budget function and principles of user equilibrium and system optimization with travel time budgets, are proposed. Then, two deterministic bi-level programming models are firstly formulated to maximize the network accessible flow. The upper level focuses on choosing the potential links in the pre-specified candidate set, and the lower level assigns all the flows to the super network with principles of user equilibrium or system optimization with travel time budgets. Moreover, to handle uncertain potential demands in reality, the problem of interest is further formulated as two-stage stochastic programming models. To solve these proposed models, efficient heuristic algorithms are designed on the basis of probability search algorithm, Frank-Wolfe algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation method. Finally, two sets of numerical experiments in the Sioux Falls network and San Diego freeway network, are executed to test and analyze the rationality and efficiency of the proposed approaches.

We first provide the problem definition of MLR-RSS and show that the MLR-RSS problem is NP-complete. An integer linear programming model is formulated. We then present two heuristic algorithms, named the independent algorithm and the sequential algorithm, and two approximation algorithms, named the MLR-combined algorithm and the weighted MLR-combined algorithm. The performance of the algorithms is compared via simulation, and results show that the weighted MLR-combined algorithm has the best performance. Results suggest that our proposed MLR algorithm outperforms existing single line rate algorithms by more than 20%. Also, the RS distribution suggests that certain nodes in the network have a much higher probability of being chosen as RSs than the others.																			1943-0620	1943-0639				MAR 1	2014	6	3					291	302		10.1364/JOCN.6.000291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.6.000291													WOS:000332214200007

To improve the security and robustness of data transmission and reduce the communication burden, a coding-decoding communication mechanism and a discrete-time dynamic periodic event-triggered mechanism are introduced into the communication channels. To be specific, a coder converts the transmitted data into specific codewords, which are then decoded by the corresponding decoder. The discrete-time dynamic periodic event-triggered mechanism determines whether the decoded values are released at certain periodic sampling instants. Thereafter, distributed set-membership estimators are designed to determine ellipsoidal sets that contain the system states, where the proposed estimators are truly distributed with a desirable scalability. Simultaneously, by utilizing mathematical induction, ellipsoidal set theory, and recursive optimization algorithms, it is possible to derive sufficient conditions for the existence of distributed set-membership estimators. By solving optimization problems, the estimator gain matrices and corresponding parameters are calculated. In the end, an illustrative example is provided to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed set-membership estimation method.

J	Tomlin, B				Tomlin, Brian			Managing supply-demand risk in global production: Creating cost-effective flexible networks	BUSINESS HORIZONS												Globalization has led to the creation of hyper-efficient supply chains that work well in a predictable world. However, with globalization comes a world full of uncertainties, and these efficient supply chains often cannot cope with unpredictable fluctuations in demand and supply. These supply-demand imbalances are a major business risk in a vast array of industries-including aerospace and defense, auto-mobiles, chemicals, engineered products, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors-because capacity is very expensive. Mix flexibility-whereby a plant can produce more than one kind of product-is an attractive antidote to this risk. In this article, we discuss better and worse ways to embrace mix flexibility. To begin, senior executives need to answer two key questions: How do we create flexible plants? And how do we go from flexible plants to a cost-effective flexible network? Successful companies will not blindly apply the same flexibility tactic throughout their business: they will tailor the Four Ps-product design, process design, production technology, and people-to fit the different characteristics of different tiers in their production chains. Successful companies will not sacrifice cost at the altar of flexibility: they will create cost-effective flexible networks by strategically configuring partially flexible networks in a way that delivers almost all the benefits of totally flexible networks.

System parameter uncertainties are considered and a sector condition method is employed to deal with the saturation problem. Based on the network transmission environment, the NCSs can be modeled as a class of saturated discrete-time systems with time-varying delays and actuator faults. By using Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) stability theory, a sufficient condition for the fault tolerant controller design of NCSs is derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities.

Low Cost Wireless Sensor Networks for Continuous Bridge Monitoring	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY					6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 08-12, 2012	Stresa, ITALY	Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Politecnico Milano				Continuous monitoring wireless sensor networks (WSN) are considered as one of the most promising means to harvest information from large structures in order to assist in structural health monitoring and management. At the same time, continuous monitoring WSNs suffer from limited network lifetimes, since they need to propagate large amounts of data over regular time intervals towards a single destination in the network. Propagation of information is done through multiple hops, suffering from collisions, retransmissions and therefore high energy consumption. Moreover, since there is a bottleneck effect around the network sink, all routing layer algorithms will always deplete the power of the last tier before the fusion center. Finally, theory shows that in such networks scalability could become an issue since transport capacity per node is severely affected as the number of nodes within the network increases. Therefore, in order for WSNs to be considered as an efficient tool to monitor the health state of large structures, their energy consumption should be reduced to a bare minimum. In this work we consider a couple of novel techniques for increasing the lifetime of the sensor network, related to both node and network architecture. Namely, we consider new node designs that are of low cost, low complexity, and low energy consumption. Moreover, we present a new network architecture for such small nodes, that would enable them to reach a base station at large distances from the network, with minimal energy.																					978-0-415-62124-3				2012							239	244																WOS:000328502800023

An explicitly coupled hydro-geomechanical model for simulating hydraulic fracturing in arbitrary discrete fracture networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS												Modeling hydraulic fracturing in the presence of a natural fracture network is a challenging task, owing to the complex interactions between fluid, rock matrix, and rock interfaces, as well as the interactions between propagating fractures and existing natural interfaces. Understanding these complex interactions through numerical modeling is critical to the design of optimum stimulation strategies. In this paper, we present an explicitly integrated, fully coupled discrete-finite element approach for the simulation of hydraulic fracturing in arbitrary fracture networks. The individual physical processes involved in hydraulic fracturing are identified and addressed as separate modules: a finite element approach for geomechanics in the rock matrix, a finite volume approach for resolving hydrodynamics, a geomechanical joint model for interfacial resolution, and an adaptive remeshing module. The model is verified against the Khristianovich-Geertsma-DeKlerk closed-form solution for the propagation of a single hydraulic fracture and validated against laboratory testing results on the interaction between a propagating hydraulic fracture and an existing fracture. Preliminary results of simulating hydraulic fracturing in a natural fracture system consisting of multiple fractures are also presented. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, the mechanical and electrochemical stability of flexible supercapacitors under different flexible conditions is limited by the weak bonding between adjacent layers, posing a significant hindrance to their practical applicability. Herein, based on the uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose (BC), a flexible all-in-one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis process. This strategy ensures the continuity of the 3D network of BC throughout the material, thereby forming a continuous electrode-separator-electrode structure. Benefitting from this bioinspired structure, the all-in-one supercapacitor not only achieves a high areal capacitance (3.79 F cm-2) of electrodes but also demonstrates the integration of high tensile strength (2.15 MPa), high shear strength (more than 54.6 kPa), and high bending resistance, indicating a novel pathway toward high-performance flexible power sources. A flexible all-in-one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis, harnessing uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose. The design establishes a seamless electrode-separator-electrode structure and facilitates stress transfer within and between layers. Thereby, the supercapacitor demonstrates remarkable shear and bending resistance, presenting a promising approach for the integrated development of high-performance flexible power sources. image																			0935-9648	1521-4095				2024 MAY 29	2024										10.1002/adma.202402695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.202402695		MAY 2024						38742820					WOS:001234248700001

The share of hydrogen compressors can not only reduce the number of compressors, but also provide the economy of scale. However, the previous studies only consider the whole share of compressors and mostly treat the compressor model as reciprocating compressors by default, which limits the optimization of hydrogen networks and does not correspond well with the practice. This paper presents a novel method for hydrogen network synthesis considering the hydrogen compressor type selection and the interstage suction/discharge of multi-stage compressors. In the developed superstructure, hydrogen sources are allowed to be suctioned and discharged via all possible stages of multi-stage compressors. Meanwhile, hydrogen sources can select centrifugal compressors or reciprocating compressors according to the working ranges. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed to minimize the total annualized cost. The proposed method is suitable for both retrofit problems and new design problems, which is demonstrated by a refinery case and a literature case. For the refinery case, the zero-investment retrofit based on the existing compressors can reduce the fresh hydrogen demand by 1.73%, and the new hydrogen network design re-quires fewer compressors. In terms of the literature case, the hydrogen network design obtained in this paper can reduce the number of compressors by 5 or 3 through interstage suction/discharge of multi-stage compressors.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Koopman, JS				Koopman, JS			Infection transmission science and models	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES					International Symposium on Infectious Agent Transmission Model Building	FEB, 2005	Natl Inst Infectious Dis, Tokyo, JAPAN		Natl Inst Infectious Dis			Infection transmission systems circulate infection through complex contact patterns related to both contact patterns and patterns of factors that affect the risk of transmission given contact. The nonlinear dynamics of infection transmission cause these patterns to make big differences in population infection levels. A science of infection transmission system analysis is needed to focus on those details that affect the control of infection transmission. This science must have a strong theoretical base because there is little chance that a dominantly data based approach not using mechanistic models of transmission will have any predictive value. The theoretical base should be built on linked transmission system models that are focused on making needed inferences for both building the theoretical base and making infection control decisions. The linking of different models is needed for a strategy of inference robustness assessment that is designed to find the model that is simple enough to effectively analyze the transmission system but not so simple that realistic violation of simplifying assumptions will change an inference. Types of models that should be used in such linked analyses include deterministic and stochastic compartmental models, discrete individual models with individual event histories but structured mass action mixing, network models that provide more detail as to who has contact with whom, and intermediate model forms such as correlation models that address some aspects of contact details while preserving the flexibility of deterministic compartmental models to structure mixing and analyze the system. While transmission system science is currently weak in regards both to its data base and its theory base, many things are now coming together that could make this science flourish. On the data side these include greater ability to detect infectious agent sequences in the environment and greater ability to sequence and genetically relate agents identified at different sites in the transmission system. On the theory sides, new model construction and model analysis methods are providing new potential to use the new sources of data. Also new parameter estimation methods provide new potential to combine models and data in effective analytic strategies.																			1344-6304	1884-2836				DEC	2005	58	6					S3	S8											16377860					WOS:000234439100023

To identify these modifications, conventional approaches have focused on local metabolic pathways without considering the global effects on metabolic behavior. Computational approaches using genome-scale models have successfully identified genetic modifications while considering their global effects on metabolism. However, these approaches can take a significant amount of time to find the optimal modifications due to the large size of metabolic networks. In this work, we present mixed-integer programming (MIP) methods and analysis of bounds on dual variables for fast and effective identification of genetic modification strategies. Using the bi-level optimization approach by Kim and Reed (2010), we demonstrate how our MIP methods significantly improve performance of strain design algorithms.

As different types of networked systems become more integrated, the relation between distinct kinds of network devices has become more intertwined. In order to guarantee the robustness of such systems, survivability problems of interdependent networks must be addressed. A characteristic of the proposed algorithm is that the continuous availability of the entire system is guaranteed by the preservation of certain structures in the original networks during the restructuring process. Simulation results demonstrate that the restructuring heuristic can substantially enhance the survivability of interdependent networks.

Delay-dependent robust asymptotic state estimation of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy Hopfield neural networks with mixed interval time-varying delays	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS					1st International Symposium on Computing in Science and Engineering	JUN 03-05, 2010	Kusadasi, TURKEY					This paper investigates delay-dependent robust asymptotic state estimation of fuzzy neural networks with mixed interval time-varying delay. In this paper, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model representation is extended to the robust state estimation of Hopfield neural networks with mixed interval time-varying delays. The main purpose is to estimate the neuron states, through available output measurements such that for all admissible time delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is globally asymptotically stable. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional which contains a triple-integral term, delay-dependent robust state estimation for such T-S fuzzy Hopfield neural networks can be achieved by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI), which can be easily facilitated by using some standard numerical packages. The unknown gain matrix is determined by solving a delay-dependent LMI. Finally two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Nag, A; Tornatore, M; Mukherjee, B				Nag, Avishek; Tornatore, Massimo; Mukherjee, Biswanath			On the effect of channel spacing, launch power, and regenerator placement on the design of mixed-line-rate optical networks	OPTICAL SWITCHING AND NETWORKING												Due to the increasing heterogeneity and the growing volume of traffic, telecom backbone networks are going through significant innovations. Wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks can now cost-effectively support the growing heterogeneity of traffic demands by having mixed line rates (MLR) over different wavelength channels. The coexistence of wavelength channels with different line rates, e.g., 10/40/100 Gbps, in the same fiber brings up various design issues: in this study, we focus on (1) choice of channel spacing; (2) choice of launch power; and (3) regenerator placement. Channel spacing affects the signal quality in terms of bit-error rate (BER), and hence affects the maximum reach of lightpaths, which is a function of line rates. Various approaches to set an opportunistic width of the channel spacing can be considered, viz., (i) uniform fixed channel spacing specified by the ITU-T grid (typically 50 GHz); (ii) different channel spacing for different line rates; or (iii) optimal value of channel spacing for all line rates that leads to minimum cost. The launch optical power of a signal is another important parameter that affects the network cost. Adjacent channels on different line rates, especially 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps, may exhibit serious degradation of signal quality and optical reach for both the channels due to cross-phase modulation (XPM) between them. Launch power plays a role in such a scenario as it governs the BER by affecting both the signal power and the noise power due to XPM. Moreover, intelligent choice of launch powers on different line rates can significantly reduce the number of regenerators required in the network. The tradeoff between placement of regenerators and choice of launch power is an important problem to address for MLR network design. In this work, we investigate the effects of channel spacing and launch optical power by evaluating the cost of a MLR network for different values of these parameters. We also study the interplay between regenerator placement and launch power. Our results show that (a) it is possible to identify optimal values of channel spacing for a minimum-cost MLR network design, and (b) controlling the power of 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps channels shows maximum sensitivity to the network cost.

J	Sharma, T; Verma, NK; Masood, S				Sharma, Teena; Verma, Nishchal K.; Masood, Shahrukh			Mixed fuzzy pooling in convolutional neural networks for image classification	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS												Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are being widely practised in computer vision applications, where pooling indicates as an integral part. Pooling significantly reduces the training time and computational cost of any network. The pooling operations generally being used are max, average, or stochastic. The performance of the CNN architecture can be increased by using more than one pooling operations. Herein, a novel mixed fuzzy pooling is proposed for image classification in the CNN architecture. In the proposed mixed fuzzy pooling, max pooling and fuzzy pooling are combined together to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed mixed fuzzy pooling is designed as a function of max pooling, fuzzy pooling, and alpha parameter where the learning of the proposed pooling function takes place with the value of alpha. In fuzzy pooling, Type-2 fuzzy logic is used to get the convolved dominant features. This is obtained by the estimation of a threshold for image region to be pooled. Thereafter, Type-1 fuzzy logic is used to get the pooling output by a weighted average of convolved dominant features. The performance of various pooling strategies on MNIST dataset for handwritten digits classification and CIFAR-10 dataset for RGB images classification have been compared and analysed. The experimental results show better image classification accuracy for the proposed mixed fuzzy pooling than conventional pooling operations.																			1380-7501	1573-7721				MAR	2023	82	6					8405	8421		10.1007/s11042-022-13553-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-13553-0		AUG 2022											WOS:000834736500003

In this article, we propose a continuous object boundary tracking algorithm for IWSNs - which fully exploits the collective intelligence and machine learning capability within the sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm first determines an upper bound of the event region covered by the continuous objects. A binary tree-based partition is performed within the event region, obtaining a coarse-grained boundary area mapping. To study the irregularity of continuous objects in detail, the boundary tracking problem is then transformed into a binary classification problem; a hierarchical soft margin support vector machine training strategy is designed to address the binary classification problem in a distributed fashion. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows a reduction in the number of nodes required for boundary tracking by at least 50 percent. Without additional fault-tolerant mechanisms, the proposed algorithm is inherently robust to false sensor readings, even for high ratios of faulty nodes (approximate to 9%).

A Mixed Quality of Service Based Linear Transceiver Design for a Multiuser MIMO Network with Linear Transmit Covariance Constraints	2013 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (WCNC)					IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	APR 07-10, 2013	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				We solve a mixed quality of services (QoS) requirement problem for a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) network with multiple linear transmit covariance constraints. Specifically, we design linear transceivers to satisfy the data rate requirements for a set of users while the rates of the remaining users are balanced. In addition, the design will ensure a set of multiple linear transmit covariance constraints are satisfied. The coupled structure of the transmit filters makes the original problem difficult to solve in the broadcast channel (BC). Hence, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve this mixed QoS problem based on stream-wise mean square error (MSE) duality and alternating optimization framework where the optimization problem is switched between the virtual multiple access channel (MAC) and the BC by exploiting stream-wise MSE duality. The proposed iterative algorithm solves the rate balancing problem by modifying the target rates of the users. In each iteration, a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) is solved to obtain the virtual MAC receiver filters by incorporating multiple linear transmit covariance constraints, where the downlink receiver filters are obtained by minimizing each layer MSE. The power allocation in the virtual MAC is determined by solving a geometric programming (GP) where the product of layer MSEs of each user is balanced with total transmit power constraint. Simulation results for an underlay MIMO cognitive radio network demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm.

Usually, the difficulty of producing consistent and cost-effective solutions is proportional to the size and complexity of the network.

Most existing approaches assume the fixed velocity of moving objects. The release of fixed moving velocity makes the query process slowly due to the significant repetitive query cost In this paper, we study CKNN queries over moving objects with uncertain velocity in road networks. A Distance Interval Model (DIM) is designed to calculate the minimal and maximal road network distances between moving objects and query point Furthermore, we propose a novel Possibility-based Vague KNN (PVKNN) algorithm to process the query efficiently, which determines the CKNN query results with possibility within each division time subinterval of given time interval by applying the vague set theory. In the PVKNN algorithm, the query efficiency can be improved significantly with the pruning, distilling and possibility-ranking phases. With these phases, the objects candidates are scaled down and the given time interval is divided into subintervals to reduce the repetitive query cost In addition, an index structure TPRuv-Tree is designed to efficiently index moving objects with uncertain velocity in road network by involving edge connection and moving objects information. Experiments with simulation and comparison show that significant improvement in the performance of efficiency can be achieved with our proposed algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wise, CR; McGuire, M				Wise, Charles R.; McGuire, Michael			Wildland fire mitigation networks in the western United States	DISASTERS												Multiorganisational networks have become the primary vehicle through which disaster policy is designed and administered. Numerous case studies reveal their importance and the role they play in all phases of disaster management. This research emphasis on the description of coordination and collaboration lacks a descriptive framework, however, for examining the capabilities and potentialities of networks. This paper provides an overview of the network and disaster management literature and suggests six basic components of a network structural framework that can be used by researchers and practitioners. The framework is then applied to six wildland fire mitigation networks in the United States as a means of illustrating how such networks are actually configured. The results of the empirical research show that the capacity of the networks is mixed, with most lacking the ability to assess risk and evaluate their activities.																			0361-3666	1467-7717				OCT	2009	33	4					721	746		10.1111/j.1467-7717.2009.01106.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7717.2009.01106.x								19459917					WOS:000208275100004

In this system, the plant and the controller are connected with a communication bus. The plant and controller are denoted as LTI-system, but the communication bus has a periodic characteristic. So that the whole of the system characteristics is denoted as a periodic system. In this paper, we consider the guaranteed cost control in the case with the linear time-varying system. As this result, we derive the stochastic discrete algebraic Riccati equation of the time-varying case and apply this equation to the design problem of networked control system.

This study compares the use of three optimization algorithms in the design of economic optimization shell and tube mixed material heat exchangers. Design/methodology/approach A shell and tube mixed materials heat exchanger optimization design approach is expanded based on the total annual cost measured by dividing the costs of the heat exchanger to area of surface and power consumption. In this study, optimization and minimization of the total annual cost is considered as the objective function. There are three types of exchangers: cheap, expensive and mixed. Mixed materials are used in corrosive flows in the heat exchanger network. The present study explores the use of three optimization techniques, namely, hybrid genetic-particle swarm optimization, shuffled frog leaping algorithm techniques and ant colony optimization. Findings There are three parameters as decision variables such as tube outer diameter, shell diameter and central baffle spacing considered for optimization. Results have been compared with the findings of previous studies to demonstrate the accuracy of algorithms. Originality/value The present study explores the use of three optimization techniques, namely, hybrid genetic-particle swarm optimization, shuffled frog leaping algorithm techniques and ant colony optimization. This study has demonstrated successful application of each technique for the optimal design of a mixed material shell and tube heat exchanger from the economic view point.

J	LYSGAARD, J				LYSGAARD, J			DYNAMIC TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS IN VEHICLE-ROUTING AND SCHEDULING	INTERFACES												In the classical vehicle-routing problem (VRP), the underlying geographic model typically represents a road network. When this network is represented as a directed graph, driving any arc in the graph is always physically possible. In areas where customers are located on various islands, ferries must be used to transport trucks. In a graphical representation of such a transportation network, some of the arcs are present only at discrete times. I considered aspects of dynamic arcs in relation to the use of existing insertion heuristics for vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constraints (VRSPTW) and designed a specific algorithm for this special type of problem.																			0092-2102					MAY-JUN	1992	22	3					45	55		10.1287/inte.22.3.45	http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/inte.22.3.45													WOS:A1992JA51500006

Such networks embody uncertainty, advanced decision logic, and increased performance expectations. As such, they have been subject to analysis by a variety of methods, with one of the most prominent being discrete-event simulation. Simulation enables detailed flow modeling, incorporates uncertainty and allows experiment-based performance assessment. Traditional approaches to simulation are not well-suited to modeling advanced decision logic, though. This paper explores the issue of representing advanced decision logic and presents a reference model for material flow processing networks to support such representations. Implementation issues are discussed, as well.																					0-7803-9519-0				2005							1359	1366		10.1109/WSC.2005.1574398	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2005.1574398													WOS:000236253402001

NEURAL NETWORKS FOR DEFLECTIONS IN CONTINUOUS COMPOSITE BEAMS CONSIDERING CONCRETE CRACKING	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												Maximum deflection in a beam is a design criteria and occurs generally at or close to the mid-span. A methodology has been developed for continuous composite beams to predict the inelastic mid-span deflections, d(i) (considering the cracking of concrete) from the elastic mid-span deflections, d(e) (neglecting the cracking of concrete). Nine significant structural parameters have been identified that govern the change in mid-span deflections. Six neural networks have been presented to cover the entire practical range of the beams. The proposed neural networks have been validated for a number of beams with different number of spans and the errors are small for practical purposes. The methodology enables rapid estimation of inelastic deflections in continuous composite beams and requires a computational effort that is a fraction of that required for the conventional iterative or incremental analysis. The methodology can easily be extended for large composite building frames where a huge savings in computational effort would result.

In this paper, a framework is developed that allows an almost entirely automated recovery of sets of reactions comprising a CRN using experimental data. A global CRN structure is used describing all feasible chemical reactions between chemical species, i.e. a superstructure. Network search within this superstructure using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is designed to promote sparse connectivity and can integrate known structural properties using linear constraints. The identification procedure is successfully demonstrated using simulated noisy data for linear CRNs comprising two to seven species (modelling networks that can comprise up to forty two reactions) and for batch operation of the nonlinear Van de Vusse reaction. A further case study using real experimental data from a biodiesel reaction is also provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Primarily designed for monitoring purposes, many sensor applications require continuous collection and processing of sensed data. Due to the limited power supply for sensor nodes, energy efficiency is a major performance concern in query processing. In this paper, we focus on continuous kNN query processing in object tracking sensor networks. We propose a localized scheme to monitor nearest neighbors to a query point. The key idea is to establish a monitoring area for each query so that only the updates relevant to the query are collected. The monitoring area is set up when the kNN query is initially evaluated and is expanded and shrunk on the fly upon object movement. We analyze the optimal maintenance of the monitoring area and develop an adaptive algorithm to dynamically decide when to shrink the monitoring area. Experimental results show that establishing a monitoring area for continuous kNN query processing greatly reduces energy consumption and prolongs network lifetime.

By using the event sampled NN to approximate the uncertainties of the system, an NN-based adaptive model is first constructed and then the controller is designed by means of backstepping. In this scheme, the feedback state signals and NN weights signals are updated in an aperiodic manner at the triggering instants which is depending on the adaptive event trigger condition. Specially, the adaptive event trigger condition consists of the NN estimated weights and some design parameters to determine the trigger instants. The Lyapunov method and the decoupled backstepping technique is used to verify the ultimate boundedness of the NN weight error and the system signals. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the control scheme.																			1948-9439		978-1-7281-5855-6				2020							2949	2954																WOS:000621616903010

Desired properties of territories often include a reasonable balance, compact form, contiguity and small average journey times, which are usually encoded in the objective function or formulated as constraints. We address the territory design problem by developing graph theoretic models that also consider the underlying road network.

A novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is established by the non-uniform division of the delay intervals with triplex and quadruplex integral terms. Using such LKFs for constant and time-varying delay cases, new stability conditions are obtained in the T-S fuzzy framework. Based on this, a new condition for the sampled-data controller design is proposed using a linear matrix inequality representation. A numerical result is provided to show the effectiveness and potential of the developed design method.

Traffic-aware contact plan design for disruption-tolerant space sensor networks	AD HOC NETWORKS												Delay and disruption tolerant networks (DTNs) are becoming an appealing solution for extending Internet boundaries across challenged network environments. In particular, if node mobility can be predicted as in space sensor networks (SSNs), routing schemes can take advantage of the a-priori knowledge of a contact plan comprising forthcoming communication opportunities. However, the design of such a plan needs to consider available spacecraft resources whose utilization can be optimized by exploiting the expected data which is largely foreseeable in typical Earth observation missions. In this work, we propose Traffic-Aware Contact Plan (TACP): a novel contact plan design procedure based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation which exploits SSNs predictable properties in favor of delivering efficient and implementable contact plans for spaceborne DTNs. Finally, we analyze a low orbit SSN case study where TACP outperforms existing mechanisms and proves to be of significant impact on enhancing the delivery of sensed data from future space networks.

In particular, a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has been regarded as suitable for residential buildings as their low-temperature heat generation can be used to meet high heat demand. This study aims to optimize renewable energy networks on the basis of PEMFC, considering both different system mixes in an energy network and different system sizes. This study scrutinizes the overall performance of different hybrid energy networks based on PEMFC in terms of the reliability, economic, and environmental perspectives when both the heat and power generation from PEMFC are used to meet the energy need of residential communities. A hybrid renewable energy network for a residential community with 12 households is modeled and simulated using TRNSYS to evaluate the performance of different hybrid energy network scenarios. Four scenarios are created on the basis of the base case with a gas-based fuel cell (FC) system and heat tank by incrementally adding renewable energy systems-a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system, photovoltaic (PV) system, battery, electrolyzer, and hydrogen storage tank. First, the impacts of individual design variables are quantified using variance-based sensitivity analysis for identification of key design variables. Second, the cost optimization of hybrid energy network is performed under the four scenarios of system mixes. Last, the effects of the key design variables for each scenario are further scrutinized through heat maps. The analysis results of the case study confirms the feasibility of a FC system as part of renewable energy network for residential buildings. Furthermore, Scenario 3 comprising a FC system, GSHP, PV system, and battery is found to be the optimal design in terms of all the three aspects. This result suggests that the whole performance of hybrid energy network can be improved when other renewable systems are included in the network to complement the FC system. In contrast, Scenario 4 using green hydrogen has poorer performance than Scenario 3 using gas as fuel due to high unit prices of hydrogen systems and low efficiency of green hydrogen production. Furthermore, external factors such as utility prices and system unit prices are considered in further analysis and found to have great influence on the optimal design of energy networks.																			0196-8904	1879-2227				MAY 15	2023	284								116964	10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116964		MAR 2023											WOS:000973241600001

In this article, by taking into accounts of the coupling effect and cyber attacks, we dedicate to design an efficient synchronization control approach for discrete-time CNs. Given that the coupling among nodes in CNs inevitably introduces the internode data exchange, round robin (RR) protocol is adopted to prevent data collision caused by the limitation of communication resources. Moreover, a probabilistic interval model is employed to capture the characteristics of the coupling delay, i.e., the delay of the internode data transmission. The deception attacks launched on the multichannel-enabled communication network between controllers and actuators of nodes in CNs are also considered. Then, a synchronization error model is established to describe the concerned synchronization control problem. By defining appropriate Lyapunov-Krsasovskii function, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the envisioned synchronization error system are obtained, and the design method for controllers is proposed subsequently. Simulations are finally conducted to demonstrate the validity of the work.

Prestressed steel-concrete continuous composite beam is a kind of transverse load-bearing composite member formed by prestressed technology on the basis of ordinary composite beam. Aiming at the flexural behavior of prestressed steel-concrete continuous composite beams, a three-dimensional finite element numerical analysis model is established, and the whole process of the test is simulated based on BP neural network. The calculated results are in good agreement with the test. Using this model, the mechanical deformation performance of prestressed steel-concrete continuous composite beam is further analyzed, and the effects of some parameters (steel beam strength grade, concrete strength grade, concrete slab thickness, and transverse reinforcement ratio) on the flexural performance of prestressed steel-concrete continuous composite beam are discussed, which provides a reference basis for engineering design.					杜, 欢欢/JFB-3866-2023														1687-5265	1687-5273				MAY 10	2022	2022								5501610	10.1155/2022/5501610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/5501610								35592712					WOS:000804630800013

In this work we propose partitioning technique of state-based descriptions at register-transfer level targeting the network of synchronous units which are interacting asynchronically. This paper is based on the observation that during the operation of a digital system, there are conditions such that the states of data processing sub-units do not change for some period of time.																			2159-1660		0-7803-7235-2				2002							695	698																WOS:000176359700146

The signal control system of the congestion length is described by a nonlinear time-varying discrete dynamic system and synthesized by using the feedback control. A signal control algorithm in which the three signal control parameters consisting of the cycle length, green split and offset are searched systematically so as to minimize the sum of congestion lengths in the urban road network is presented. The dynamic route guidance system is consisted of both the evaluation for the mean OD travel time and the recommendable route search algorithm. The traffic flow control system, which is most effective to reduce the congestion lengths in urban road networks, is designed by connecting the signal control system with the dynamic route guidance system in real time.																					0-7803-8346-X				2004							149	152																WOS:000225098800038

Previous studies usually focus on small-scale reservoir models and there is also a lack of research that completely focuses on NF characteristics. Using the continuous -discontinuous element method (CDEM), a Hydro -Mechanical (HM) coupling model was constructed to explore the propagation mechanism of hydraulic fracture (HF) and the effects of NF characteristics on HF propagation. The results show that as the HF approaches the NFs, the NFs preferentially tend to undergo shear failure, resulting in a decelerated HF propagation rate and an increased injection pressure. After water enters the NFs, the HF rapidly propagates, so the fracture area swiftly increases and the HF has a more tortuous fracture morphology. The NF orientation (alpha) and the internal friction angle (phi) exhibit a pronounced and distinct effect on HF propagation. Specifically, when alpha is 30 degrees similar to 60 degrees, the HF propagation is more tortuous and complex, so it is easier to form a larger transverse reconstruction range. When the NF density (eta) is no less than 0.12, the HF tends to open the NFs and form a more tortuous morphology, but a higher eta does not necessarily imply a higher fracture complexity. A longer NF (l > 12 m) benefits to improve the longitudinal reservoir reconstruction scope, but has little impact on the overall reconstruction effect. In the presence of stress shadow effect, it is improbable for the HF to completely open the intersecting NFs; instead, it typically opens only a segment or one of them. Consequently, it may be challenging to establish a fracture network with the simultaneous development of primary and branching fractures. Additionally, some water leakage into the inactive NFs gives rise to a decline in both the fracture length and fracture area. The findings can offer theoretical insights for refining the fracturing design in shale reservoirs with NFs.																			0266-352X	1873-7633				APR	2024	168								106170	10.1016/j.compgeo.2024.106170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compgeo.2024.106170		FEB 2024											WOS:001199513800001

The proposed model formulation is believed to be superior to the available ones. In the past, the tasks of optimizing batch schedules, water-reuse subsystems, and wastewater treatment subsystems were performed individually. In this study, all three optimization problems are incorporated in the same mathematical programming model. By properly addressing the issue of interaction between subsystems, better overall designs can be generated. The resulting design specifications include the following: the production schedule, the number and sizes of buffer tanks, the physical configuration of the pipeline network, and the operating policies of water flows. The network structure can also be strategically manipulated by imposing suitable logic constraints.

The reaching law makes the sliding variable rate of change proportional to the inverse tangent of this variable, which results in bounded state and control effort. Then we apply the proposed reaching law to design an efficient flow control strategy for multi-source connection oriented (for example ATM or MPLS) data transmission networks. The strategy ensures full exploitation of the available bandwidth and eliminates the risk of data loss in the network. Moreover, the strategy proposed in this paper generates bounded data transmission rates which are limited by design parameters and do not depend on the initial state of the network.

Novel weight update laws for the critic and action NN's are derived, and all parameters are tuned online. Lyapunov techniques are used to show that all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and that the output of the action NN approaches the optimal control input with small bounded error.

Generative adversarial networks are known to be effective in constructing separation networks when the ground truth for the observed signal is inaccessible. Still, weak objectives aimed at distribution-to-distribution mapping make the learning unstable and limit their performance. This study introduces the remix-cycle-consistency loss as a more appropriate objective function and uses it to fine-tune adversarially learned source separation models. The remix-cycle-consistency loss is defined as the difference between the mixed speech observed at microphones and the pseudo-mixed speech obtained by alternating the process of separating the mixed sound and remixing its outputs with another combination. The minimization of this loss leads to an explicit reduction in the distortions in the output of the separation network. Experimental comparisons with multichannel speech separation demonstrated that the proposed method achieved high separation accuracy and learning stability comparable to supervised learning.																			1520-6149		978-1-6654-0540-9				2022							4373	4377		10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746655	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746655													WOS:000864187904132

The optimization study was performed at a fixed Reynolds number of 15, with four dimensionless design variables, viz. the ratio of the subchannel width to the main channel width, the ratio of the subchannel length to the pitch length, the ratio of the subchannel depth to the main channel depth, and the ratio of the recombination channel width to the main channel width. The design space was investigated by a parametric study, and the design points within the design space were selected by the Latin hypercube sampling method. Two different objective functions, viz. the mixing index at the micromixer exit and mixing effectiveness, were used alternately for the single-objective optimizations. Mixing effectiveness was defined as the ratio of the mixing index to the pressure drop. A surrogate modeling technique based on a radial basis neural network was used to approximate the objective functions. Optimum configurations of the micromixer were found through the mixing-index and mixing-effectiveness optimizations. The optimum design of the micromixer obtained by the mixing-index optimization confirmed 33.0% relative increase in the mixing index compared with the reference micromixer. The mixing index, 0.86, which was achieved by the optimization of the micromixer, is much higher than those of the other split-and-recombine micromixers at the same mixing length and Reynolds number, and the optimized micromixer could be integrated with microfluidic systems including lab on a chip and micro total analysis system.

Wireless sensor networks are composed of independent distributed smart sensor nodes and gateways. These discrete sensors constantly gather external physical information, such as temperature, sound, and vibration. Owing to the diversity of sensor devices and the complexity of the sensor sensing environment, the direct modeling of an IoT-aware business process application is particularly difficult. In addition, how to effectively deploy those designed applications to discrete servers in the heterogeneous sensor networks is also a pressing problem. In this paper, we propose a resource-oriented modeling approach and a dynamic consistent hashing (DCH)-based deploying algorithm to solve the above problems. Initially, we extended the graphic and machine-readable model of Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) 2.0 specification, making it able to support the direct modeling of an IoT-aware business process application. Furthermore, we proposed the DCH-based deploying algorithm to solve the problem of dynamic load balancing and access efficiency in the distributed execution environment. Finally, we designed an actual extended BPMN plugin in Eclipse. The approach presented in this paper has been validated to be effective.

During wafer fabrication, several types of defects can be coupled together in a piece of wafer, it is called mixed-type defects DPR. To detect mixed-type defects is much more complicated because the combination of defects may vary a lot, from the type of defects, position, angle, number of defects, etc. Deep learning methods have been a good choice for complex pattern recognition problems. In this article, we propose a deformable convolutional network (DC-Net) for mixed-type DPR (MDPR) in which several types of defects are coupled together in a piece of wafer. A deformable convolutional unit is designed to selectively sample from mixed defects, then extract high-quality features from wafer maps. A multi-label output layer is improved with a one-hot encoding mechanism, which decomposes extract mixed features into each basic single defect. The experiment results indicate that the proposed DC-Net model outperforms conventional models and other deep learning models. Further results of the interpretable analysis reveal that the proposed DC-Net can accurately pinpoint the defects areas of wafer maps with noise points, which is beneficial for mixed-type DPR problems.

The proposed model formulation allows us to consider various static and dynamic time-scheduling protocols, in-network processing implementations and encompasses sampled-data systems as a particular case. Provided that the continuous-time observer is robust to the measurement errors (in an appropriate sense) we derive bounds on the maximum allowable transmission interval that ensure the convergence of the observation errors under network-induced communication constraints. The stability analysis is trajectory-based and utilizes small-gain arguments. A number of observers can be combined and used within our approach to obtain estimators for NCS.					; Nesic, Dragan/O-2609-2013	Postoyan, Romain/0000-0002-2454-602X; Nesic, Dragan/0000-0001-7944-0241													0018-9286					MAY	2012	57	5					1309	1314		10.1109/TAC.2011.2181794	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2181794													WOS:000303325100025

The objective is to improve the efficiency in handling various types of messages, e.g., control signals, sensor data and production orders, by on-line adjustment of the parameters of the network protocol. This paper presents conceptual design, development, and implementation of a performance management procedure for CIM applications. The performance management algorithm is formulated using the concepts of: (i) perturbation analysis of discrete event dynamic systems; (ii) stochastic approximation; and (iii) learning automata. The performance management procedure has been tested via emulation on a network testbed that is based on the Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP). The conceptual design presented in this paper offers a step forward to bridging the gap between management standards and users' demands for efficient network operations since most standards such as ISO and IEEE address only the architecture, services, and interfaces for network management. The proposed concept for performance management can also be used as a general framework to assist design, operation, and management of flexible manufacturing systems.

J	Kim, SM				Kim, Seon Man			Auditory filterbank denoising neural network for speech enhancement in wearable auditory device	ELECTRONICS LETTERS												In this study, a speech enhancing neural network (NN) is proposed, which is designed for monaural auditory devices, specifically designed for use in hearing aids. Herein, a 32-channel auditory filterbank (FB) is first implemented with an algorithm processing delay of 8 ms, which is tailored to meet the requirements of auditory devices. The proposed method primarily aims to integrate a denoising NN within the analysis phase of a uniform polyphase discrete Fourier transform (DFT) FB, aimed at enhancing speech within each band. For the denoising model, complex-valued convolutional NNs have been applied, specifically targeting the restoration of speech phase information based on the spectral components of the DFT. A multi-loss method is introduced, which is designed to further account for the loss of analysed speech signals within the split bands during the training process, leveraging the DFT FB strategy. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method, objective assessments of speech intelligibility and quality scores are conducted under various noise conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the existing method across all types of noise. The proposed auditory filterbank denoising neural network aims at enhancing speech within each band by integrating a denoising neural network within the analysis phase of a uniform polyphase discrete Fourier transform filterbank for auditory devices such as hearing aids. All components of the proposed architecture, that is, analysis filterbank, synthesis filterbank and speech denoising model, are integrated into a single neural network architecture, and used for inference and training. image																			0013-5194	1350-911X				MAY	2024	60	10							e13228	10.1049/ell2.13228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/ell2.13228													WOS:001231134800001

Among the many factors driving this need are the current high interest in personal communication devices, and a desire for ever faster information transmission rates over the existing telecommunication network. Many of today's communication systems are designed and tested using techniques that cannot be characterized as either digital or analog. The data being processed, and the processing techniques themselves, do not fall neatly into either the digital or analog categories. Two approaches to mixed-signal testing, using currently available test-set hardware and software, have been developed and are presented in this paper. The research being done on a third, experimental, self-test method - and the techniques for accessing internal test nodes - are also discussed.																			8756-2324					MAR-APR	1994	73	2					49	55		10.1002/j.1538-7305.1994.tb00578.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1994.tb00578.x													WOS:A1994NL78900006

In a first step, a discrete Hamiltonian framework endowed with a Lie derivative-like formula is introduced. It is shown that the discrete dynamics encodes energy conservation and passivity. Additionally, the characterization of the discrete dynamics in terms of Dirac structure is shown to be invariant by interconnection. The class is thus composable: networked systems belong to the class. In a second step, the discrete dynamics is considered as a one-step integration method. The method is shown to be convergent and provides a discrete-time approximation of an input/output Hamiltonian system. Accordingly, the discrete dynamics inherits intrinsic energetic characteristics (storage function and dissipation rate) from the original system. The method is thus tagged as passive integrator. As an illustration, the closed-loop behavior of interconnected subsystems and the stabilization of a rigid body spinning around its center of mass are presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Continuous evaluation of fastest path queries on road networks	ADVANCES IN SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DATABASES, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science				10th International Symposium on Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases	JUL 16-18, 2007	Boston, MD	Oracle Spatial, ESRI, Microsoft Res				The one-shot shortest path query has been studied for decades. However, in the applications on road networks, users are actually interested in the path with the minimum travel time (the fastest path), which varies as time goes. This motivates us to study the continuous evaluation of fastest path queries in order to capture the dynamics of road networks. Repeatedly evaluating a large number of fastest path queries at every moment is infeasible due to its computationally expensive cost. We propose a novel approach that employs the concept of the affecting area and the tolerance parameter to avoid the reevaluation while the travel time of the current answer is close enough to that of the fastest path. Furthermore, a grid-based index is designed to achieve the efficient processing of multiple queries. Experiments on real datasets show significant reduction on the total amount of reevaluation and therefore the cost for reevaluating a query.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-540-73539-7				2007	4605						20	+																WOS:000248149700002

Such a program may reach solvability limitations of MIP algorithms for large scale real world data, so a suitable heuristic development is welcome.

In the first stage of the network development, the most important issue is to find an appropriate solution for the base station location from a given set of candidate sites. The network can be considerably improved if the base station location solution found during the planning phase is designed to achieve optimal performance and cost-efficient WiMAX networks. This work 1 presents a framework that gives the operators a new perspective in mobile WiMAX network design by simplifying the problem and translating it into a formal optimization routine with consideration of economic factors. We propose a mixed integer programming model that considers the WiMAX specific features and services, and present optimization strategies based on four meta-heuristics, Tabu Search, Variable Neighborhood Search, Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing.

Existing approaches often rely on model-based mixed-integer optimization that is hard to scale or employ deep learning to solve specific engineering problems yet with limited generalizability. In this paper, we show that failure evaluation provides a common kernel to improve the tractability and scalability of existing solutions. By providing a neural network function approximation of this common kernel using graph attention networks, we develop a unified learning-based framework, FERN, for scalable Failure Evaluation and Robust Network design. FERN represents rich problem inputs as a graph and captures both local and global views by attentively performing feature extraction from the graph. It enables a broad range of robust network design problems, including robust network validation, network upgrade optimization, and fault-tolerant traffic engineering that are discussed in this paper, to be recasted with respect to the common kernel and thus computed efficiently using neural networks and over a small set of critical failure scenarios. Extensive experiments on real-world network topologies show that FERN can efficiently and accurately identify key failure scenarios for both OSPF and optimal routing scheme, and generalizes well to different topologies and input traffic patterns. It can speed up multiple robust network design problems by more than 80x, 200x, 10x, respectively with negligible performance gap.

The network was designed to output the stress-strain-volumetric response from inputting the soil properties. 31 biaxial shearing tests with varying soil parameters were generated using the DEM simulations. Based on these 31 training samples, a three-layer neural network was established. 2 extra samples were generated to examine the validity of the network, and the predicted curves using the ANN were well matched with those from the DEM simulations. Overall, the ANN was found promising in effectively modelling the soil behaviour.

The fuzzy neural network is firstly used as approximator to compensate for the unknown certainty equivalent controller. Then, in order to solve the uncertainties from approximation errors and random input disturbances, a dead zone like auxiliary error with a timevarying boundary layer is introduced. The auxiliary error is designed for the construction of adaptive laws and the time-varying boundary layer is applied as a bounding parameter. Based on a Lyapunov like analysis, it is shown that the internal signals are bounded and the norm of output tracking error will asymptotically converge to a residual set which is bounded by the width of the boundary layer. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify effectiveness of the proposed direct adaptive iterative learning control.

Based on the exact T-S linear discrete state space model, a stochastic optical controller of the nonlinear system is designed. The controller can make the nonlinear networked control system stochastic stable. Experimental results show the correctness and the validity of the controller.

However, there are practical situations where movement decisions may be modified to ensure connectivity. For example, emergency responders in a crisis region relying upon an ad hoc network may need constant reliable communications and therefore adjust their search plan to stay connected, though aspects of their mission may override their objective of staying connected. We present a discrete formulation for this problem and a method for solving it optimally. We propose a cooperative and a noncooperative algorithm, showing that the run-time of the latter is drastically more efficient with a minimal performance cost relative to optimality.																					978-1-4244-1036-1				2007							382	+		10.1109/CISS.2007.4298333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2007.4298333													WOS:000252254400071

Bi-objective bimodal urban road network design using hybrid metaheuristics	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH												In this paper a bimodal discrete urban road network design problem with bus and car modes is investigated. The problem consists of decision making for lane addition to the existing streets, new street constructions, converting some two-way streets to one-way streets, lane allocation for two-way streets, and the allocation of some street lanes for exclusive bus lanes. Two objectives are considered in the problem: maximization of consumer surplus, and maximization of the demand share of the bus mode. The interaction of automobile and bus flows are explicitly taken into account and a modal-split/assignment model is used to obtain the automobile and bus flows in the deterministic user equilibrium state. The main contribution of the paper lies in proposing a new network design problem that combines the road network design decisions with the decision making for bus networks.

These facts decrease portability. A middleware is the software layer that allows to abstract the actual characteristics of each embedded platform. Using a middleware decreases the difficulty in designing applications, but programming for different middlewares is still a barrier to portability. This paper presents a design methodology based on an abstract middleware environment that allows to abstract even the services provided. This is gained by allowing the designer to smoothly move across different design paradigms. As a proof the paper shows how to mix and exchange applications between tuple-space and message-oriented based middleware environments.																			1530-1591		978-1-4244-3781-8				2009							1024	+																WOS:000273246700183

The concrete mixing videos were collected in a specially designed set up fixed on a mixer located in the mixing station. These videos were transformed into a series of image sequences to fit the deep learning model to predict the slump and slump flow values of concrete, with six groups in total and more than twenty thousand image sequence samples. The workability of six groups concrete with different strength grades learned by the DL model, was estimated. The results indicate that the trained deep learning model with CNN and LSTM can estimate concrete workability effectively. Our goal to estimate concrete workability in different strength grades is achieved.																			0263-2241	1873-412X				DEC	2021	186								110073	10.1016/j.measurement.2021.110073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2021.110073		SEP 2021											WOS:000704893800005

However, bond pruning is irreversible and yields a single bulk response. Using material stiffness as a tunable design parameter, we create metamaterial networks where allosteric responses are achieved without bond removal. Such systems are experimentally realized through variable stiffness bonds that can strengthen and weaken on-demand. In a disordered mechanical network with variable stiffness bonds, different subsets of bonds can be strategically softened to achieve different bulk responses, enabling a multiplicity of reprogrammable input/output allosteric responses.

The major focus of this paper is on designing a multivariable tracking scheme, including the filterbased action network (FAN) architecture, and the stability analysis in continuous-time fashion. In this design, the FAN is used to observe the system function, and then generates the corresponding control action together with the reference signals. The goal network will provide an internal reward signal adaptively based on the current system states and the control action. This internal reward signal is assigned as the input for the critic network, which approximates the cost function over time. We demonstrate its improved tracking performance in comparison with the existing heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) approach under the same parameter and environment settings. The simulation results of the multivariable tracking control on two examples have been presented to show that the proposed scheme can achieve better control in terms of learning speed and overall performance.

In the present study saturation flow is estimated with cycle time, approach width, proportion of two wheelers, proportion of three wheelers and proportion of cars using regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks. A comparison of MLR and ANN prediction of field saturation flow is made, and the study results showed that ANN are highly accurate because of their self-computing and intelligent behaviour. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value is less and Index of Agreement (IA) value is high for best fitted ANN model when compared to those for MLR and INDO HCM models. The developed ANN satisfactorily predicted the saturation flow at signalized intersections in mixed traffic conditions with MAPE of 1.76% and with IA of 0.999.

The devices in a WPAN must be low cost and operate for a long time from a battery. As a consequence, they pose demanding requirements on the utilized integration technology. In this paper we confront these requirements with the newly released international technology roadmap for semiconductors (ITRS-2001). Power consumption is identified as the key problem, motivating a large research effort in low power design techniques. In addition, it is pointed out that WPAN devices will consist of different technologies, requiring a better design support for mixed-technology integration.

The idea is to use iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to obtain the iterative tracking control law which makes the iterative performance index function reach the optimum. When the iterative tracking control law and iterative performance index function in each iteration cannot be accurately obtained, the convergence criteria of the iterative ADP algorithm are established according to the properties with finite approximation errors. If the convergence conditions are satisfied, it shows that the iterative performance index functions can converge to a finite neighborhood of the lowest bound of all performance index functions. Properties of the finite approximation errors for the iterative ADP algorithm are also analyzed. Neural networks are used to approximate the performance index function and compute the optimal control policy, respectively, for facilitating the implementation of the iterative ADP algorithm. Convergence properties of the neural network weights are proven. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the performance of the developed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, a new model is established to describe random data-dropout processes. Then, the fixed threshold iterative learning control scheme based on randomly received saturated output data is designed to track the desired trajectory and reduce the update number of iterations. Further, in order to obtain a faster convergence or learning speed, a novel method based on varying parameter along iteration axis is given.

J	Dev, NK; Caprihan, R; Swami, S				Dev, Navin K.; Caprihan, Rahul; Swami, Sanjeev			Strategic positioning of inventory review policies in alternative supply chain networks: an information-sharing paradigm perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												One of the key issues in the current research on supply chain (SC) networks is the need for planning the nature of the inventory policy at each echelon of the SC network structure. Given the inherent uncertainties pervading the operational environment within real-world SC networks, it becomes imperative therefore, for each partnering echelon to focus on its individual inventory review policy from the viewpoint of global optimisation of the overall SC performance. Two key factors contributing to the aforementioned uncertainty are the lead time and their standard deviations, and the extant literature has often advocated the adoption of demand information-sharing between the partnering echelons to mitigate the deleterious impact of these factors on system performance. In this paper, we explicitly focus attention on these factors through their manifestation within two different hypothetical SC networks, and study their impact on the average fill rate performance of the assumed systems with and without demand information-sharing. Towards this end, we develop discrete event simulation models of the hypothetical SC structures and exploit the Taguchi experimental design procedure as a vehicle for conducting the simulation experiments and analysing its outcome. While simulation results highlight the impact of the assumed factors on system-wide performance, the Taguchi paradigm further helps identify appropriate combinations of these factors for optimal fill rate performance. Key results reveal that sharing of demand information between partnering echelons should not automatically be taken for granted as a direction for performance enhancement.																			1367-5567	1469-848X				FEB 1	2013	16	1					14	33		10.1080/13675567.2013.767324	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13675567.2013.767324													WOS:000316082300002

Synthesis of reverse osmosis desalination network under boron specifications	DESALINATION												Recent regulations regarding water quality motivated research in reverse osmosis (RO) technology for water desalination especially under boron restrictions. Boron control in the permeate products by reverse osmosis technology comprises several mitigation options which impose capital and operation costs. In our study, we investigate the design of RO system under the design concept of split partial second pass reverse osmosis (SPSPRO) in order to allow extraction of permeate streams along the RO pressure vessels. The design approach is based on superstructure optimization which allows the identification of optimal process layout and optimal operation conditions of the process units. pH adjustment of the network streams is also included in the model to control boron species distribution during the separation process. A mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) model is subsequently formulated based on the superstructure representation. The mathematical programming formulation is demonstrated on a case study to show the application of the mathematical programming model.

However, despite these developments, the actual characteristics of female international entrepreneurial networks and how these different constituent properties have been leveraged as part of the internationalization process is less well understood. This article contributes to this gap in knowledge by decomposing the networks of female international entrepreneurs into structural and relational components using ego-network analysis, prior to examining how these different components were instrumental in facilitating international expansion. Our study involves eight female international entrepreneurs in the fashion industry from Denmark. Findings from this mixed-methods study show that female international entrepreneurs typically have small, dense, and homogeneous network structures, with strong ties, reciprocity, and trust. Furthermore, intra-industry contacts were mobilized considerably more that affective networks, while many network ties were not leveraged to expand internationally.																			0898-5626	1464-5114				JAN 1	2023	35	1-2					103	128		10.1080/08985626.2022.2158491	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08985626.2022.2158491		DEC 2022											WOS:000899097100001

J	Kim, SM				Kim, Seon Man			Auditory filterbank denoising neural network for speech enhancement in wearable auditory device	ELECTRONICS LETTERS												In this study, a speech enhancing neural network (NN) is proposed, which is designed for monaural auditory devices, specifically designed for use in hearing aids. Herein, a 32-channel auditory filterbank (FB) is first implemented with an algorithm processing delay of 8 ms, which is tailored to meet the requirements of auditory devices. The proposed method primarily aims to integrate a denoising NN within the analysis phase of a uniform polyphase discrete Fourier transform (DFT) FB, aimed at enhancing speech within each band. For the denoising model, complex-valued convolutional NNs have been applied, specifically targeting the restoration of speech phase information based on the spectral components of the DFT. A multi-loss method is introduced, which is designed to further account for the loss of analysed speech signals within the split bands during the training process, leveraging the DFT FB strategy. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method, objective assessments of speech intelligibility and quality scores are conducted under various noise conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the existing method across all types of noise. The proposed auditory filterbank denoising neural network aims at enhancing speech within each band by integrating a denoising neural network within the analysis phase of a uniform polyphase discrete Fourier transform filterbank for auditory devices such as hearing aids. All components of the proposed architecture, that is, analysis filterbank, synthesis filterbank and speech denoising model, are integrated into a single neural network architecture, and used for inference and training. image																			0013-5194	1350-911X				MAY	2024	60	10							e13228	10.1049/ell2.13228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/ell2.13228													WOS:001233060600005

With regards to the supramolecular chemistry of infinite solids, attention is usually focussed on the design of an efficient, programmed assembly motif through the choice of suitable building blocks. However, as well illustrated by the discrete structures, a hallmark property of a supramolecular system is its ability to reversibly assemble to optimize its structure, effectively error checking. For a rigid infinite framework, this feature is less obvious. Error checking is manifested in an extended framework through structural rearrangements in the solid state. Coordination frameworks, as they are often at least partially sustained by weaker interactions, can demonstrate such dynamic behavior in response to some external stimulus. Selected examples, chosen to illustrate a range of network types and rearrangements, will be discussed in this short review.																			0044-2968						2005	220	4					364	372		10.1524/zkri.220.4.364.61625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1524/zkri.220.4.364.61625													WOS:000228394500007

The simple molecular crystals between the pi-planar molecules of 2,2'-diaminobithiazolium (DABT) derivative and hydrogen-bonding H3PO4 formed the proton-transferred salts with proton conductivities above similar to 10(-4) S cm(-1) and anisotropic behavior. Controlling the crystallization condition facilitated the formation of binary salts between di-cationic H2DABT(2+) and (H3PO4-)(2) or mixed proton-transferred (H2PO4-)(2) (H3PO4)(2 )with different hydrogen-bonding networks, including one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) networks. The structural isomers of 2,2'-diamino-4,4'-bithiazolium (2,4-DABT) and 2,2'-diamino-5,5'-bithiazolium (2,5DABT) formed a different type of packing structure even with the same crystal stoichiometry of (H2DABT(2+))(H2PO4-)(2) and/or (H2DABT(2+))(H2PO4-)(2) (H3PO4)(2) where the latter salt had different protonated species of H2PO4- and H3PO4 in the hydrogen-bonding network. Four and 10 protons per H2DABT(2+) molecule (H+: carrier concentration) were present in the (H2DABT(2+))(H2PO4-)(2) and (H2DABT(2+))(H2PO4-)(2) (H3PO4)(2) salts, respectively, which accounted for the highly proton-conducting behavior in the latter mixed protonated crystal. To design anhydrous intrinsic H+ conductors, both the mixed proton transfer state and uniform O-H center dot center dot center dot O= hydrogen-bonding interaction are essential factors that must be considered.

However, the vulnerability of ML to adversarial attacks, designed to manipulate its predictions, raises concerns. Unlike the conventional focus on computer vision, recent attention has shifted towards assessing the feasibility of such attacks in network security. This poster presents a taxonomy outlining the practical challenges of adversarial attacks on ML-based NIDS and an initial investigation into the impact of continuous training on these attacks. Results suggest that re-training, even without adversarial training, can mitigate the effects of attacks. This work aims to highlight the gap between research and real-world practicality in this field.																					979-8-3503-3945-1				2023										10.1109/CNS59707.2023.10288658	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CNS59707.2023.10288658													WOS:001095064900004
J	Wu, WT; Ko, JW				Wu, WT; Ko, JW			A neural network decoupler for multivariable control	PROCESS CONTROL AND QUALITY												Decoupling control provides an advantage of reducing control-loop interactions in multivariable control. The control system can be easily designed and operated. However, most decouplers are sensitive to modeling errors, especially for the system with relative gains being far away from unity. In practical application, decoupling control still presents some difficulties. This work is to design a neural network decoupler for decoupling control. The neural network decoupler is insensitive to modeling errors and does not have the unstable poles that are due to mathematical operations based on the transfer function model. Implementation of the neural network decoupler to a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) demonstrates that decoupling control with the decoupler gives satisfactory results in control performance. The neural network decoupler improves the applicability of decoupling control.																			0924-3089						1999	11	3					211	222		10.1163/156856699750248577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156856699750248577													WOS:000081180000004

First, an event-triggered fault/state observer is designed to estimate the system state and actuator fault simultaneously. And then, a discrete-time sliding surface is constructed in state-estimation space. By the use of a reformulated Lipschitz property and delay system analysis method, the sliding mode dynamics and state/fault error dynamics are converted into a unified linear parameter varying (LPV) networked system model by taking into account the event-triggered scheme, actuator fault, external disturbance and network-induced delay. Based on this model and with the aid of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, a delay-dependent sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the stability of the resulting closed-loop system with prescribed H-infinity performance. Furthermore, an observed-based sliding mode FTC law is synthesized to make sure the reachability of the sliding surface. Finally, simulation results are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, CH; Rong, BY; Cui, SG				Liu, Chun-Hung; Rong, Beiyu; Cui, Shuguang			Optimal Discrete Power Control in Poisson-Clustered Ad Hoc Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												Power control in a digital handset is practically implemented in a discrete fashion, and usually, such a discrete power control (DPC) scheme is suboptimal. In this paper, we first show that in a Poison-distributed ad hoc network, if DPC is properly designed with a certain condition satisfied, it can strictly work better than no power control (i.e., users use the same constant power) in terms of average signal-to-interference ratio, outage probability, and spatial reuse. This motivates us to propose an N-layer DPC scheme in a wireless clustered ad hoc network, where transmitters and their intended receivers in circular clusters are characterized by a Poisson cluster process on the plane R-2. The cluster of each transmitter is tessellated into N-layer annuli with transmit power Pi adopted if the intended receiver is located at the ith layer. Two performance metrics of transmission capacity (TC) and outage-free spatial reuse factor are redefined based on the N-layer DPC. The outage probability of each layer in a cluster is characterized and used to derive the optimal power scaling law P-i is an element of Theta (eta(-(a/2))(i)), with eta(i) as the probability of selecting power P-i and a as the path loss exponent. Moreover, the specific design approaches to optimize P-i and N based on eta(i) are also discussed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed optimal N-layer DPC significantly outperforms other existing power control schemes in terms of TC and spatial reuse.

C	Markham, A; Trigoni, N			IEEE	Markham, Andrew; Trigoni, Niki			Discrete Gene Regulatory Networks (dGRNs): A novel approach to configuring sensor networks	2010 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM	IEEE INFOCOM				Conference on IEEE INFOCOM	MAR 15-19, 2010	San Diego, CA	IEEE				The operation of a sensor network is determined by a large number of parameters, such as the radio duty cycle, the frequency of neighbor discovery beacons, and the rate of sampling sensors. Writing adaptive algorithms to tune these parameters in dynamic network conditions is a challenging task that requires expert knowledge, and many design-test-rewrite cycles. This paper proposes a novel nature-inspired paradigm, termed discrete Gene Regulatory Network (dGRN), for configuring sensor networks. The idea is that nodes should regulate their parameters based on their local state and state communicated from neighbor nodes, in a similar manner that cells regulate their behavior based on local levels of protein concentrations, and proteins diffused from neighbor cells. The proposed dGRN paradigm has two major strengths: 1) it is general-purpose, and can be applied to a variety of parameter tuning problems; and 2) it generates parameter tuning code automatically removing the need for a human expert. We demonstrate the feasibility of the dGRN approach in a scenario where nodes must tune their sampling rates to track a moving target with a certain accuracy. The automatically generated code exhibits properties similar to the ones that one would expect from expert-designed code, such as aggressive sampling when the target moves fast and the sensing range is low, and relaxed sampling otherwise. Moreover, the automatically generated code causes nodes to communicate with each other to coordinate their tuning tasks, as one would expect from expert-designed code. The resulting dGRN code is evaluated both in a simulation environment, and in a real environment with eight T-Mote Sky nodes tracking a light-emitting target.

It is observed that building CRF defined on full resolution features into CNN can generate segmentation masks of better quality, however there exist several challenges related to training efficiency and computation costs. To design a more powerful segmentation model by using CRF and full resolution features, this paper proposes a novel fully supervised scheme for semantic segmentation based on superpixels and continuous CRF (C-CRF). Our new architecture includes three subnetworks: a unary network, a pairwise network and a superpixel based continuous CRF network (SCCN). The unary network upsamples low resolution features via de-convolutional structures, while pairwise network learns pixel-level pairwise similarities. The outputs of the two networks are fed to the SCCN that consists of two differentiable superpixel pooling layers and a differentiable C-CRF layer, leading to inference between superpixels in an image. The whole framework is trained in an end-to-end way by the jointly pixel-level and superpixel-level supervised learning strategy. Besides, C-CRF inference is fused with pixel-level prediction during the test procedure to decrease the effect of superpixel quality. In the experiments, we evaluate the power of the three subnetworks and the learning strategy comprehensively. Results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that compared with baseline networks and other CRF based semantic segmentation methods, performance gain can be achieved by using the proposed SCCN.

Increasingly, computer control algorithms reside inside individual system components in a distributed fashion. Variable camshaft timing (VCT) is an appealing feature for automotive engines because it allows optimization of the cam timing over a wide range of operating conditions. In this paper, a method to distribute the discrete multiple-input mutiple-output controller for the VCT engine to improve the component swapping modularity of the VCT actuator and the EGO sensor components using network communications is presented. First, a discrete LQG controller is designed, and then this controller is distributed to the engine control unit, the VCT controller, and the EGO sensor controller in order to maximize the component swapping modularity of the system. A control oriented pre-optimization technique, which simplifies the optimization problem, and a candidate solution was devised to maximize component modularity.					Ulsoy, A.

Some parameters like water/cement ratio, amount of fine and coarse aggregates in mix, admixtures and so on affect shotcrete strength. Due to the large number of such parameters, it is very difficult to predict the shotcrete strength. Today, owing to intelligent methods, modeling has a particular role in engineering sciences and predicting material behavior. Therefore, this paper examines different mix designs of shotcrete containing microsilica and records their 28-day compressive strength. Regarding shotcrete mix design parameters as inputs, ANN and SVR models were used to predict compressive strength of shotcretes. The correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) statics are used for performance evaluation of proposed predictive models. All of the results showed that the accuracy of the proposed soft computing methods is quite satisfactory as compared to experimental results. The finding of this study indicated that the both ANN and SVM models are sufficient tools for estimating the compressive strength of shotcrete.																			1425-8129					MAR-APR	2019	24	2					126	+																WOS:000465644800005

The system is prone to external disturbances and network uncertainties, such as losses and delays of data packets. The randomness of network uncertainties introduces stochasticity in the system. The design starts with the formulation of control-affine dynamics based on a single integrator robot model, formation error, and sliding surface dynamics. An event-triggering condition is then derived for an update of control input for each agent. These input updates guarantee desired consensus in finite time with reaching time of each agent's sliding surface having an upper bound. The admissibility of event-driven near-optimal control updates is also ensured for each agent. The near-optimal control design for each agent has achieved through neural-network-based actor-critic architecture. The implementation of Pioneer P3-DX mobile robots illustrates threefold efficacy of the proposed design: 1) advantages of event-driven approach and higher order sliding mode controller; 2) robustness to network uncertainties; and 3) near-optimality in system performance.

Radar-based continuous monitoring methods typically extract time-domain features manually such as pulse transit time (PTT) to calculate the BP. However, breathing and slight body movements usually distort the features extracted from pulse-wave signals, especially in long-term continuous monitoring, and manually extracted features may have limited performance for BP estimation.

A heartbeat signal-guided single-beat pulse wave extraction method is designed to obtain pure pulse-wave signals. A transformer network-based blood pressure estimation network is proposed to estimate BP, which utilizes convolutional layers with different scales, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to capture time-dependence in continuous radar signal and multi-head attention modules to capture deep temporal domain characteristics. A radar signal dataset captured in an indoor environment containing 31 persons and a real medical situation containing five persons is set up to evaluate the performance of TRCCBP. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the average accuracy of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) is 4.49 mmHg and 4.73 mmHg, improved by 12.36 mmHg and 8.80 mmHg, respectively. The proposed TRCCBP source codes and radar signal dataset have been made open-source online for further research.

There are software that can simulate the behaviour of electrical grids under different operating conditions, but these simulation environments cannot be used in a single cloud-based project, because they are not GNU-licensed software products. In this paper, an integrated framework was proposed that models and simulates communication networks. The design and operation of the simulation environment are investigated and a model of electrical components is proposed. After simulation, the simulation results were compared to manual computed results.

Our methodology introduces a two-stage framework that integrates the first-stage system design problem with a second-stage control problem of the EV charging stations and develops a design and analysis of computer experiments (DACE) based system design optimization solution method. Our DACE approach generates a metamodel to predict revenue from the control problem using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), fit over a binned Latin hypercube (LH) experimental design.

Reconfigurable Data Center Networks (RDCNs) have been designed to fulfill the demanding requirements of ever-changing data center traffic. However, they pose new challenges for network traffic engineering, e.g., interference between reconfigurations, transport layer protocols, and congestion control (CC) algorithms. This raises a fundamental research problem: can the current transport layer protocols handle frequent network updates? This paper focuses on TCP and presents a measurement study of TCP performance in RDCNs. In particular, it evaluates diverse traffic mixes combining TCP variants, UDP, and QUIC transport protocols. The quantitative analysis of the measurements shows that migrated TCP flows suffer from frequent reconfigurations. The effect of reconfigurations on the cost, e.g., increased Flow Completion Time (FCT), depending on the traffic mix is modeled with Machine Learning (ML) methods. The availability of such a model will provide insights into the relationship between the reconfiguration settings and the FCT. Our model explains 88% of the variance in the FCT increase under different reconfiguration settings.																			1932-4537					APR	2024	21	2					1372	1386		10.1109/TNSM.2023.3327508	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2023.3327508													WOS:001205268100035

A new consecutive packet dropout model is established to describe the phenomenon of packet dropout in both the sensor-controller (S-C) and controller-actuator (C-A) channels. First, the considered system with observer-based control scheme is studied in the discrete-time domain by using equivalent discretization transformation. In order to simplify subsequent analysis, matrix exponential computation is employed to transform the discrete-time system into a more tractable form. Then, the proposed new consecutive packet dropout model is taken into consideration to establish the stochastic mean square exponential stability condition. Furthermore, a novel two-step synthesis approach is used to design the observer-based controller. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed observer-based sampled-data control approach is verified using a numerical example. In addition, the advantages of the proposed approach are validated through comparisons.

In recent years, variable speed limit (VSL) has been a promising solution and attracts considerable attention from both industry and academy. In this paper, a multi-agent reinforcement learning model and evolution strategy-based approach is proposed to provide both macroscopic and microscopic control in mixed traffic scenarios. In this approach, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are introduced into Deep Q-Networks for vehicles' decision making. The architecture of the VSL network is designed using an evolution strategy to provide real-time speed limit. A dedicated reward function has been implemented to consider both the actions and speed limit. Extensive experiments are conducted focusing on Bottleneck networks. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has demonstrated superior performance compared with other baselines in terms of several metrics such as throughput, average speed, and safety.																					979-8-3503-1275-1				2023							27	32		10.1109/SM57895.2023.10112494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SM57895.2023.10112494													WOS:000990489700005
J	De Vendictis, A; Baiocchi, A; Bonacci, M				De Vendictis, A; Baiocchi, A; Bonacci, M			Analysis and enhancement of TCP Vegas congestion control in a mixed TCP Vegas and TCP Reno network scenario	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION												Its more refined congestion control mechanisms, also based on the estimation of round trip delays, allow TCP Vegas to outperform the more widespread TCP Reno congestion control, based only on the packet loss detection, in a number of network environments. However, these mechanisms make TCP Vegas less aggressive with respect to TCP Reno; thereby TCP Vegas sources show high weakness in taking the available bandwidth when competing with other TCP Reno sources. This is a major reason that hinders the spread of TCP Vegas among Internet users. In this work, after a preliminary analytic study about the limits of TCP Vegas in mixed network environments, we describe a new adaptive mechanism for TCP Vegas, called TCP NewVegas, designed in order to improve its performance even in heterogeneous network scenarios. The large number of simulations, presented in this paper, show that TCP NewVegas guarantees good performance even in mixed network environments, without canceling the desirable features (e.g. fairness) that TCP Vegas exhibits in homogeneous environments.

By introducing some slack matrix variables, a robust control design approach is presented, which keeps the Lyapunov-Krasovskii matrices out of any product with the system matrices. Thus, the design conservatism is reduced since the restriction is removed that a single Lyapunov matrix is enforced.

The fleet is composed of electric vehicles and gasoline vehicles. The problem is called combined passenger and parcel transportation problem with a mixed fleet (CPPT-MF). We construct a time-expanded network which is used to model the movements of passengers, parcels and vehicles in space and time. A mixed-integer linear programming model of the problem is developed on the basis of the time-expanded network. A network partitioning-based math-heu-ristic is proposed to efficiently solve large-scale instances of the problem. The model and the heuristic are evaluated using a set of real-world instances from a taxi company and a set of randomly generated instances.

The objective is the minimization of average zone pressure, while penalizing deviations from a target chlorine concentration. We propose a relax-tighten-round algorithm based on tightened polyhedral relaxations and a rounding scheme to compute feasible solutions, with bounds on their optimality gaps. This is because off-the-shelf global optimization solvers failed to compute feasible solutions for the considered non-convex mixed integer nonlinear program. The implemented algorithm is evaluated using three benchmarking water networks, and they are shown to outperform off-the-shelf solvers, for these case studies. The proposed heuristic has enabled the computation of good quality feasible solutions in most instances, with bounds on the optimality gaps that are comparable to the order of uncertainty observed in operational water network models.

However, for the existing CNN-based HSI-classification methods, most of them only consider single-scale feature extraction, which may neglect some important fine information and cannot guarantee to capture optimal spatial features. Moreover, many state-of-the-art methods have a huge number of network parameters needed to be tuned, which will cause high computational cost. To address the aforementioned two issues, a novel multiscale residual network (MSRN) is proposed for HSI classification. Specifically, the proposed MSRN introduces depthwise separable convolution (DSC) and replaces the ordinary depthwise convolution in DSC with mixed depthwise convolution (MDConv), which mixes up multiple kernel sizes in a single depthwise convolution operation. The DSC with mixed depthwise convolution (MDSConv) can not only explore features at different scales from each feature map but also greatly reduce learnable parameters in the network. In addition, a multiscale residual block (MRB) is designed by replacing the convolutional layer in an ordinary residual block with the MDSConv layer. The MRB is used as the major unit of the proposed MSRN. Furthermore, to enhance further the feature representation ability, the proposed network adds a high-level shortcut connection (HSC) on the cascaded two MRBs to aggregate lower level features and higher level features. Experimental results on three benchmark HSIs demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MSRN method over several state-of-the-art methods.

However, the implementation of protective mechanisms results in increased overall energy consumption, making its usage not optimal. This paper focuses on the fault tolerance of the average consensus algorithm with the generalized Metropolis-Hastings weight design with a modified mixing parameter and without any protection. The robustness of the algorithm is examined using an MSE-metric for four various initial configurations and the obtained results are compared with concurrent weight designs for various failure probabilities.

Powder Mixed EDM (PMEDM) is a new process through which a better surface can be reached, nevertheless, PMEDM is a complicated and random process influenced by many parameters, and the intricacies of mechanism hinders its application. This paper presents a method that can be used to forecast the surface roughness in the PMEDM process with the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs with back propagation (BP) algorithm coupled with an orthogonal design was applied to the modeling of the PMEDM system and simulation of experimental conditions. An orthogonal design was utilized to design the experimental protocol, in which peak current, pulse-on time, discharging area, servo voltage and no-load voltage were varied simultaneously. The results showed that the ANNs model reflected the complex relationship of PMEDM and had high predicting accuracy.

When this is not the case, is required an observer. In this paper, the super-twisitng second-order sliding-mode algorithm is modified in order to design an observer for the actuators; then a recurrent high order neural network (RHONN) is used to identify the plant model, under the assumption of all the state is available for measurement. The learning algorithm for the RHONN is implemented using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm. On the basis of the identifier a controller which uses inverse optimal control, is designed to avoid solving the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation.

To better enrich and enhance the kinetics and performance of DM maps, this article introduces two improved control methods to construct a series of DM maps with different network typologies by coupling DM seed maps. Some specific examples are demonstrated to back up these methods. Due to the effect and specific constructs of memristors, the new coupling DM maps will have infinite invariant points with higher dimensions, whose advantages of larger parameter space and expended chaotic ranges are evaluated by dynamic simulations.

As such, we present a new framework for designing robust network protocols under varying network conditions that attempts to integrate various given objectives while satisfying some pre-specified levels of Quality of Service. The proposed framework abstracts a network protocol as a queuing policy, and relies on convex relaxation methods and the theory of mixing time for finding the fast queuing policies that drive the distribution of packets in a queue to a given target stationary distribution. In addition, we show how to augment the basic proposed framework to obtain a queuing policy that produces epsilon-approximation to the target distribution with faster convergence time which is useful in fast-changing network conditions.

EDF schedule is employed in the channels both from sensor to controller and controller to actuator. Moreover, the measurement output signal and control signal are quantized by a logarithmic quantizer before they enter the controller and system, respectively. The main purpose of the problem addressed is to design a dynamical output-feedback controller such that the prespecified H-infinity performance of the system is guaranteed over a given finite time-horizon. To this end, a sufficient condition is firstly established for the existence of the desired output-feedback controller.

The purpose of this research is to obtain the greatest uniformity in a direct-type BLU, while the brightness is maintained in a satisfactory level. It is difficult to find a numerical optimization algorithm that is readily applicable to this problem because of the existence of discrete variables, implicit objective functions and constraints, or even binary constraints. The sequential neural-network approximation (SNA) method is designed specifically for this type of engineering design optimization problem. In this paper, a two variable LCD BLU design example is presented first to illustrate the design process using the SNA method.

Such mismatches are inevitable due to the proliferation of a multitude of networking architectures, hardware, and software on one hand, and the need for global connectivity on the other hand. In order to circumvent this problem the solution of protocol conversion has been proposed. In this paper we present a systematic approach to protocol conversion using the theory of supervisory control of discrete event systems, which was partially first addressed by Inan. We study the problem of designing a converter for a given mismatched pair of protocols, using their specifications, and the specifications for the channel and the user services.

This article focuses on alternative zone-based tariffs, which vary in the way zones are cut (ring structure vs. connected zones) and fares are calculated (counting zones, cumulative pricing, and maximum pricing), and compares their ability to exploit the customers' willingness to pay. For this purpose, we formulate six versions of the tariff design problem, investigate their computational complexity, and develop suited mixed-integer models. Our comprehensive computational study reveals that tariffs based on cumulative pricing outperform traditional distance-based tariffs and are best suited to exploit the customers' willingness to pay.

Design of optimal water-using networks with internal water mains	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												To provide more efficient usage of water resources and to minimize wastewater discharge, the design of water allocation networks has drawn increased attention over the past two decades. However, water system integration yields more structurally complex plants with greater interactions among the process units. Therefore, it is desirable to simplify the network structure with internal water mains, which help to attenuate the propagation of disturbances through the more complex water networks. In this paper, a general methodology for the design of optimal water-using networks with internal water mains is proposed using a new superstructure and a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) strategy, given specifications of the mass load of the contaminants to be removed from each process unit and the lower and upper bounds on the contaminant concentrations. The mathematical program is formulated with constraints that bound the maximum number of outlet streams from each process unit. The most attractive networks, which have near-minimal freshwater consumption, relatively simple structures, and promising controllability, can be further designed to assess their operating and installation costs and controllability. This approach is applied to multicontaminant, water-using systems and is used for the design of water-using networks with multiple internal water mains.					feng, xiao/KIL-4264-2024														0888-5885					DEC 6	2006	45	25					8413	8420		10.1021/ie050911n	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie050911n													WOS:000242367200018

The minimum spanning tree problem, the two edge-connected spanning subgraph problem (2-ECSS) and the tree augmentation problem (WTAP) are all examples of fundamental well-studied network design tasks that postulate different initial states of the network and different assumptions on the reliability of network components. In this paper we motivate and study Flexible Graph Connectivity (FGC), a problem that mixes together both the modeling power and the complexities of all aforementioned problems and more. In a nutshell, FGC asks to design a connected network, while allowing to specify different reliability levels for individual edges. In this paper we develop a general algorithmic approach for approximating FGC that yields approximation algorithms with ratios that are close to the known best bounds for many special cases, such as 2-ECSS and WTAP. Our algorithm and analysis combine various techniques including a weight-scaling algorithm, a charging argument that uses a variant of exchange bijections between spanning trees and a factor revealing min-max-min optimization problem.

The problem is initially modeled as a nonlinear integer programming formulation and two solution approaches are proposed: (i) a reformulation of the problem as a mixed integer second order cone program to optimally solve the problem for small to medium scale problem instances, and (ii) an evolutionary algorithm using elements of iterated local search and scatter search to provide upper bounds. Extensive computational results on new benchmark problem instances and on real case data are presented. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although many works have been developed to cope with this problem, but only few of them have investigated the three-dimensional (3-D) continuous movement control of multiple drone cells. In this paper, a problem of 3-D continuous movement control of multiple drone cells is formulated with an objective of maximizing the energy-efficient communication coverage of drone-cell networks while preserving the network connectivity. To mitigate this challenging problem, an energy-efficiency and continuous-movementcontrol algorithm (E2CMC), which is based on an emerging deep reinforcement learning method, is proposed. InE2CMC, an energy-efficiency reward function considering the energy consumption, the sum of quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of users as well as the coverage fairness is first designed. Next, E2CMC learns to adjust drone cells' locations continuously by interacting with an environment in a sequence of observations, actions, and rewards. Furthermore, E2CMC will reduce the reward drastically as long as the networks are disconnected. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed learning algorithm on deploying multiple drone cells to provide the communication coverage.

Although most of the HEN synthesis approaches have focused on obtaining network designs with utilities placed in extreme positions, several works have recently tackle the synthesis problem pursuing an optimal placement of utilities within the heat exchange sequences of the process streams. To this purpose, extended HEN superstructures with sophisticated mixed-integer nonlinear programming models and solution algorithms have been developed. However, due to the combinatorial and nonconvex nature of the problem, sub-optimal designs are frequently obtained even for relatively small synthesis problems. In this work the optimal placement of utilities within HEN designs is reconsidered as a final stage of HEN synthesis methodologies in which a base network design has already been produced. An optimization and utilities relocation approach is presented to explore the generation of improved network designs, with modified topologies that place heaters and coolers in alternative challenging positions with respect to their original placement in the base network design. Four illustrative examples are presented to show that enhanced designs with reduced total annual costs can be developed with the proposed methodology. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Designing new European rail freight services	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY												We present an optimization model for design of transportation services, with a particular emphasis on how attention to service quality affects the design. The model is applied to a real-world case study where opportunities for new rail-based freight transportation services are explored. Fleet sizing is introduced to the service network design, because cost of acquiring locomotives is high, and inefficient resource utilization could result if fleet sizing is carried out a posteriori. The problem is a cross-border planning problem, introducing need for change of locomotives at borders, and separate fleets of locomotives thus have to be modelled. Demand in the system is characterized by various commodity groups with different service quality requirements. We propose a mixed integer programming model with a nonlinear objective function. The model finds the most profitable operations for the train operator when important service quality factors are accounted for.

The experimental data were extracted and they were used as learning dataset to train the neural network. To find a proper architecture for network, an iteration method was used. Based on the results, there was no over-fitting in designed neural network and the neural network was able to track the data. ANN outputs showed that the maximum errors in predicting thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity are 2% and 2.5%, respectively. Based on the ANN outputs, two sets of correlations for estimating the thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity were presented. The comparisons between experimental data and the proposed correlations showed that the presented correlations were in an excellent agreement with experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Applications discussed include single-phase and two-phase heat sinks and heat exchangers, two-phase flow separators, desorbers, and passive micromixers. Advantages of using these fractal-like flow networks versus parallel-flow networks include lower pressure drop, lower maximum wall temperature, inlet plenum symmetry, alternate flow paths, and pressure recovery at the bifurcation. The compact nature of microscale fractal-like branching heat exchangers makes them ideal for modularity. Differences between fractal-like and constructal approaches applied to disk-shaped heat sink designs are highlighted, and the importance of including geometric constraints, including fabrication constraints, in flow network design optimization is discussed. Finally, a simple pencil and paper procedure for designing single-phase heat sinks with fractal-like flow networks based solely on geometric constraints is outlined. Benefit-to-cost ratios resulting from geometric-based designs are compared with those from flow networks determined using multivariable optimization. Results from the two network designs are within 11%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

For example, imagery features occurring in human visual systems are the continuing reduction of redundancy towards the "sparse edge maps". Different edge features are mathematically equivalent to be "ones among zeros". When edges are multiplying together as the vector inner product resulted in almost zero, namely pseudo-orthogonal ICA. This fact has been derived from the first principle of artificial neural networks using the maximum entropy information-theoretical formalism by Bell & Sejnowski in 1996. We explore the blind de-mixing condition for more than two objects using two sensor measurement. We design two smart cameras with short term working memory to do better image de-mixing of more than two objects.

For such a purpose we built a mixed-reality, multi-user platform, which we named Aroaro and can be deployed on different virtual reality and augmented reality devices. In Aroaro, users can experience data visualization, either individually or as part of a team. With a set of lab tasks designed to lead lab subjects to analyze the network information while immersing into the rich virtual environment, our approach belongs to the nascent area of immersive analytics. We assume a business unit has already procured some network data set and been tasked with problems that need to reveal information about the network's connectivity properties. This paper is concerned with how a business unit achieves problem solving (decision-making) when relying on immersive analytics. Our approach combines a high-quality virtual environment such as Aroaro, its data visualization engine and the analytics afforded by concepts of network centrality in a network.

In search for further progress, the present letter investigates Reservoir Computing (RC) as an alternative new paradigm for acoustic modeling. RC unifies the appealing dynamical modeling capacity of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the simplicity and robustness of linear regression as a model for training the weights of that network. In previous work, an RC-HMM hybrid yielding very good phone recognition accuracy on TIMIT could be designed, but no proof was offered yet that this success would also transfer to LVCSR. This letter describes the development of an RC-HMM hybrid that provides good recognition on the Wall Street Journal benchmark. For the WSJ0 5k word task, word error rates of 6.2% (bigram language model) and 3.9% (trigram) are obtained on the Nov-92 evaluation set. Given that RC-based acoustic modeling is a fairly new approach, these results open up promising perspectives.																			1070-9908	1558-2361				MAR	2014	21	3					311	315		10.1109/LSP.2014.2302080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2302080													WOS:000331810800003

The problem of designing reduced-order H-infinity filters for discrete-time systems from incomplete measurements is investigated in this paper. A Bernoulli distributed white sequence is adopted as a model for the normal operating condition of packet delivery and transmission failure. The reduced-order filter to be designed from incomplete measurements is required to to ensure the mean-square stability of the filtering error system and to guarantee a prescribed H-infinity filtering performance level. It is shown that such a desired reduced-order H-infinity filter can be constructed under a sufficient condition expressed in terms of two linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) subject to a rank constraint.

However, most of the existing deep hashing methods still have the problems of low feature learning efficiency and weak ranking relationship discrimination. To remedy these problems, a novel Ranking-based Deep Hashing Network (RDHN) is proposed for image retrieval in this paper, which integrates the feature learning module and hash learning module into a unified deep hashing network framework to jointly learn a powerful hash function so that the raw images can be mapped to discrete hash codes with significant discrimination. Specifically, a novel difference convolution is designed based on edge detection operators, and then it is uniquely applied to the first convolutional layer of the convolutional neural network (CNN), which can take advantage of the sensitive characteristics of edge detection operators for edge information to extract richer image edge information. Meanwhile, in hash learning, the ranking metric Mean Average Precision (MAP) is optimized using the idea of scaling, and then a ranking loss function based on MAP is carefully designed to enhance the neighborhood ranking capabilities of the hash codes. Furthermore, to reduce the quantification error, a quantization loss function is also designed. Finally, the ranking loss function is combined with the quantization loss function to form the objective function. The proposed method can generate high-quality discrete hash codes while learning to preserve ranking information, effectively improving retrieval performance. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing approaches.

In this paper, a comparative study has been exemplified based on an intelligent fault location algorithm using illustrious feature extraction techniques such as discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for a 400-kV double-circuit transmission line of Chhattisgarh State in MATLAB/Simulink software. The proposed intelligent algorithm uses standard deviations of discrete coefficients of three-cycle data of three-phase current and voltage signals from relaying point to edify the hidden connotations of neural structures. Extensive simulation studies have been performed for all types of common shunt faults at widespread circumstances by varying different fault parameters in the presence of mutual coupling. However, the mean error in fault location estimation is within +/- 1%; henceforth, the outcomes are worthy to get a research insight while designing relaying algorithms.

Such management systems have to be self-adaptive w.r.t. different aspects, at applications level (functionalities) as well as deployment level (software tasks, execution platform). Holding a well-mastered and safe behaviour of the overall system, in presence of these concurrent adaptations, is a complex control problem. We approach this problem by applying techniques from the area of Supervisory Control for Discrete Event Systems (DES), where the space of configurations at the different levels are modeled with automata. We use programming language support tools, Heptagon/BZR and ReaX, to build up a design environment for the considered application domain. This paper contributes with (i) generic behavioural models for both the applicative and deployment aspects of systems; (ii) applications of Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) to design controllers, especially modular and hierarchical control structures; (iii) an implemented case study.																					978-1-5386-7698-1				2018							1472	1479																WOS:000461414700232

Firstly, a set of weighted discrete orthogonal polynomials (WDOPs) is established by using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process, and then two WDOPs-based summation inequalities, including some existing summation inequalities as special cases, are developed. Secondly, these WDOPs-based summation inequalities are applied to investigate the exponential stability criteria and explicit exponential estimates of solutions of linear delay difference systems. Finally, two numerical examples indicate that the proposed WDOPs-based approach can derive the exponential stability condition with larger decay rate than the existing ones.

The quantized lossy channel is first characterized as an uncertainty disturbance in signal-to-noise- ratio forms with both the input and output signals of the channel. Then it is shown that appropriate uncertainty characterization should be applied to conduct robust stability control and robust performance control, in order to achieve less conservative design. Single-input-single-output quantized lossy channels with both relative-error and multiplicative-error quantization as well as a multiplicative random noise are presented to illustrate the main ideas.																			2072-5639		978-1-4799-7862-5				2015																								WOS:000388123000434

A high order neural network (HONN) is used to approximate a decentralized control law designed by the backstepping technique as applied to a block strict feedback form (BSFF). The neural network learning is performed on-line by Kalman filtering. The controllers are designed for each joint using only local angular position and velocity measurements. These simple local joint controllers allow trajectory tracking with reduced computations. The applicability of the proposed scheme is illustrated via real-time implementation.

Optimal design of reverse-osmosis networks for wastewater treatment	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING-PROCESS INTENSIFICATION												An optimization study of reverse-osmosis networks (RON) for wastewater treatment has been carried Out by describing the system as a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear problem (MINLP). A mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) is derived from the original nonlinear problem by the convex relaxation of the nonconvex terms in the MINLP to provide bounds for the global optimum. The MILP model is solved iteratively to Supply different initial guesses for the nonconvex MINLP model. It is found that such a procedure is effective in finding local optimum solutions in reasonable time and overcoming possible convergence difficulties associated with MINLP local search methods.

By graph theory, matrix analysis, deep learning and optimal control method, the necessary conditions and strategies for solving the optimal consensus problem of the dynamic systems are obtained. The results show that the online policy iteration algorithm not only stabilizes the distributed second-order dynamic systems, but also achieves the optimal consensus.

In the analyzed systems, the stock used to satisfy unknown, variable demand placed at a goods distribution center is replenished with delay from a number of distant supply sources. In the considered setting, the order quantity is fixed and the instants of placing the order serve as the decision variable, which perfectly suits the switching input signals in DSM control systems. It is proved that, with the proposed nonlinear algorithm applied, the stock level does not exceed the assigned warehouse space. Moreover, it is also shown that the stock is never depleted, which ensures full demand satisfaction and maximum service level. Comparison with the classical inventory policy is provided, and improved performance of the DSM algorithm is demonstrated.

Optimal synthesis of energy supply systems for remote open pit mines	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING												The primary motivation underlying the proposal of polygeneration systems for mine sites is to increase the efficient use of natural resources by combining different technologies and energy resources while satisfying energy service demands. For many mineral producers, particularly in Canada's mining extremes of climate and depth, energy in support of mineral production can be the second largest cost center after labor. A generic methodology is proposed for the design of energy supply systems in mine sites, based on a search for the minimum discounted cost of energy supplied for all feasible different plant configurations. These configurations can be represented within a connectivity matrix which corresponds to a network representation. A Mixed Integer Programming formulation is set out for the multiperiod synthesis and operational planning problem. This is characterized by i) binary variables for the selection of technologies, ii) integer variables for the determination of the number of units installed, and iii) by continuous variables for the representation of energy and economic flows. Through the integration of particular energy supply strategies matching specific mine circumstances (on-grid, remote, degree days, etc) and consideration of technologies that improve energy efficiency, hitherto not considered new technologies and demand management systems or new perspectives on optimal mine site energy supply can be investigated. Some of these investigations identify the economic conditions through which biomass energy feedstocks should be used, for direct heat production, for gasification and providing for Fischer-Tropsch syndiesel manufacture. As well as integrating demand from mobile diesel-fueled plant into an optimization procedure this analysis shows how the techniques can be used to explore economic conditions of threshold prices for biomass (purpose-grown biomass and peat are considered herein) and trucked-in diesel. The methodology also allows for electricity and syngas storage and diesel and biomass bunkering. Within the paper the energy demands for a remote, open pit mining operation located in Northern Ontario are considered as a case study to illustrate the technique and investigations. As expected, for mines close to electricity, natural gas, and diesel distribution infrastructures, the optimal choice is to connect. When a constraint is applied specifying that connection is not possible, as would be for the case exemplified, the optimal choice includes some of the more exotic options for mine site energy supply.

In particular, after introducing the general definition of conversion to be used for reactor networks, several case studies of interest in chemical engineering are presented as topic-examples of application: (i) adiabatic-stage reactors with recycle, (ii) adiabatic-stage reactors with split, (iii) adiabatic-stage reactors intercooled by reactants and (iv) adiabatic-stage reactors with interstage distributed feed. More generally, the presented methodology can also be applied to develop the design equations for complex networks of interconnected reactors, not restricted to those considered in the present work. The motivation behind the present study lies in the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic development of the design equations of single reactors in reactor networks is currently missing in the open literature as well as in the reference textbooks of chemical reaction engineering and reactor design.

The purpose of this paper is to design a filter such that the filtering error system is stochastically stable and strictly (Q, S, R)-dissipative. To eliminate the cross coupling between the Lyapunov matrix and system matrices, some slack matrix variables are introduced.

How to mitigate this erasure, known as catastrophic forgetting, is a grand challenge for machine learning, specifically when systems are trained on evolving data streams. Self-organizing incremental neural networks (SOINN) are a class of neural networks that are designed for continuous learning from non-stationary data. Here, we propose a novel method, SOINN+, which is fundamentally different from the previous generations of SOINN with respect to how "forgetting" is modeled. To achieve a more graceful forgetting, we developed three new concepts: idle time, trustworthiness, and unutility of a node. SOINN+ learns a topology-preserving mapping of the input data to a network structure, which reveals clusters of arbitrary shapes in streams of noisy data. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world data sets showed that SOINN+ can maintain discovered structures even under sudden and recurring concept drifts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

One important feature of the proposed approach is that it associates a multistep wastewater treatment design within a source regeneration sink superstructure. This design can enforce certain design and structural specifications to tighten the model formulation and enhance solution convergence. A mixed integer nonlinear programming problem is formulated based on the proposed superstructure, which involves unit-specific shortcut models instead of the fixed impurities removal model to describe it accurately. The proposed method for water network synthesis is demonstrated using two case studies, which determine the effect of streams composition and wastewater treatment technologies on the total network cost, freshwater consumption, and water network design. The results highlight the ability of the proposed model for the developed water network synthesis by computing quickly and realizing the goals of cost savings and discharge reduction.

J	Galicki, M; Leistritz, L; Witte, H				Galicki, M; Leistritz, L; Witte, H			Learning continuous trajectories in recurrent neural networks with time-dependent weights	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS												This paper is concerned with a general learning (with arbitrary criterion and state-dependent constraints) of continuous trajectories by means of recurrent neural networks with time-varying weights, The learning process is transformed into an optimal control framework, where the weights to be found are treated as controls. A new learning algorithm based on a variational formulation of Pontryagin's maximum principle is proposed. This algorithm is shown to converge, under reasonable conditions, to an optimal solution. The neural networks with time-dependent weights make it possible to efficiently find an admissible solution (i.e., initial weights satisfying state constraints) which then serves as an initial guess to carry out a proper minimization of a given criterion, The proposed methodology may be directly applicable to both classification of temporal sequences and to optimal tracking of nonlinear dynamic systems. Numerical examples are also given which demonstrate the efficiency of the approach presented.																			1045-9227					JUL	1999	10	4					741	756		10.1109/72.774210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/72.774210								18252574					WOS:000081385700002

J	Pedroso, L; Batista, P				Pedroso, Leonardo; Batista, Pedro			Discrete-time decentralized linear quadratic control for linear time-varying systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL												This article addresses the problem of designing a decentralized control solution for a network of agents modeled by linear time-varying (LTV) dynamics, in a discrete-time framework. A general scheme is proposed, in which the problem is formulated as a classical linear quadratic regulator problem, for the global system, subject to a given sparsity constraint on the gain, which reflects the decentralized nature of the network. A method able to compute a sequence of well-performing stabilizing regulator gains is presented and validated resorting to simulations of two randomly generated LTV systems, one stable and the other unstable. Moreover, a tracking solution is developed, building on the solution to the regulator problem. Both methods rely on a closed-form solution, thus they can be computed very rapidly. Similarly to the centralized solution, both the presented methods require that a window of the future system dynamics is known. Both methods are validated resorting to simulations of: (i) a nonlinear network of four interconnected tanks; and (ii) a large-scale nonlinear network of interconnected tanks. When implemented to a nonlinear network, approximated by an LTV system, the proposed methods are able to compute well-performing gains that track the desired output. Finally, both algorithms are scalable, being adequate for implementation in large-scale networks.

The weighted one-step-ahead control is designed to stabilize the nominal linear system, while the adaptive NN compensator is introduced to deal with the nonlinearities. Under the assumption that the inverse control gain matrix has an either positive definite or negative definite symmetric part, the obstacle in NN weights tuning for the MIMO systems is transformed to unknown control direction problem for single-input-single-output (SISO) system. Discrete Nussbaum gain is introduced into the NN weights adaptation law to overcome the unknown control direction problem. It is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded, while the tracking error converges to a compact set. Simulation result illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed control.

Transmission scheduling of the control inputs has to be performed so that only one input signal is transmitted through the channel at one time. We aim at finding the minimum channel capacity rendering state feedback stabilization possible. The main novelty of this work lies in the idea of scheduling/control co-design which suggests that the transmission scheduling should be designed simultaneously with the controller design. By virtue of such co-design, a nice analytic solution is obtained for the minimum channel capacity required for stabilization given in terms of the topological entropy of the plant. A numerical example is provided to illustrate how the scheduling/control co-design is carried out to stabilize the networked system.

These systems are of couplings in every equation of each subsystem, and different subsystems may have different orders. To avoid the noncausal problem in the control design, the system is transformed into a predictor form by rigorous derivation. By exploring the properties of the block triangular form, implicit controls are developed for each subsystem such that the couplings of inputs and states among subsystems have been completely decoupled. The radial basis function NN is employed to approximate the unknown control. Each subsystem achieves a semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded stability with the proposed control, and simulation results are presented to demonstrate its efficiency.

We minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the received symbols in the system via optimizing the phase shifts at the IRS jointly with beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and equalizers at the user terminals. In order to find the optimal IRS phase shifts, a trellis-based structure is used that smartly selects the discrete phases. Moreover, for the sake of comparison, a semi-definite programming (SDP)-based discrete phase optimization is also presented. The BS beamformer and the optimal equalizers are determined via closed-form solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the trellis-based scheme has better performance compared to other discrete IRS phase shift designs, such as SDP and quantized majorization-minimization technique, while maintaining a very low computational complexity.

This papers presents analytical studies on a family of cyclic BNs to achieve stabilization and oscillations via semi-tensor product (STP) method. The family of cyclic BNs shows a similar network structure (here we call nodes connection digraph), which is cyclic. Based on the cyclic network structure, a pinning control strategy imposed on any single node is proposed to achieve stabilization. Further, using model reduction method, the size of cyclic BNs is firstly reduced to a network with a single node, which preserves oscillations with the original network. Then, based on the reduced BN with single node, several sufficient conditions for oscillations are obtained, without using the traditional state transition matrix. Finally, the simulation of a network with 10 nodes is presented to show the efficiency of proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This represents a challenge for those seeking to develop 'green' or environmentally sustainable concretes as incorporation of additional binders may increase global warming potential (GWP), however, using waste-based aggregates provides a way to avoid further consumption of natural resources. In this study, a mix design optimization framework is developed to find optimal mixes of concrete comprising different types of waste-based aggregates including concrete, slag, glass, plastic and rubber, considering trade-offs with global warming potential and natural resource minimization. Integrating a large database containing 5321 concrete mixes incorporating waste-based aggregates, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to predict concrete slump, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, elastic modulus and water absorption. Genetic algorithms are then used to identify mix designs that minimize GWP and natural resource utilization. Having presented the framework, a series of scenarios are evaluated to investigate the impact of prioritizing minimization of natural resource usage or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, and then the impact of transportation distance. The results show that the developed ANN model performs well in predicting different properties of waste-based aggregate concretes and the developed framework is capable of identifying mix designs that reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 50% as compared to similar mixes with an equivalent compressive strength in the database.

In the proposed control system, we implement a transitory compensator specialized in controlling a short-term system behavior into a standard controller that is designed for controlling a long-term behavior. To establish such control architecture, we construct a low-rank model having the same reachable and observable subspaces as those of the original system in the range of its rank. Then, we derive a redundant state-space realization associated with the low-rank model.

To solve this problem, a distributed continuous-time algorithm is designed to minimize each player's payoff function and search for the generalized Nash equilibrium. Based on the bounded derivatives and sign function, an improved average tracking dynamic is designed to estimate the average of all players' strategies. In addition, the network connectivity is maintained under the proposed algorithm if the communication network at the initial time is connected.

By constructing a new augmented plant, the optimal trajectory tracking design is transformed into an optimal regulation problem. For discrete-time nonlinear dynamics, the steady control input corresponding to the reference trajectory is given. Then, the value-iteration-based tracking control algorithm is provided and the convergence of the value function sequence is established. Therein, the approximation error between the iterative value function and the optimal cost is estimated. The uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the closed-loop system is also discussed in detail. Moreover, the iterative heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) algorithm is implemented by involving the critic and action components, where some new updating rules of the action network are provided. Finally, two examples are used to demonstrate the optimality of the present controller as well as the effectiveness of the proposed method.					; Wang, Ding/A-2949-2017	cheng, long/0000-0001-7565-8788; Wang, Ding/0000-0002-7149-5712; Mingming, Ha/0000-0002-2901-9608													2162-237X	2162-2388				AUG	2023	34	8					4237	4248		10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3123444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3123444		NOV 2021						34752409					WOS:000733510800001

Hub locations and HAZMAT transportation routes using different transportation modes are simultaneously optimized to obtain minimum risk of incidents. A mixed integer nonlinear programing model is developed. To cope with the uncertainties in the model, we provide a solution framework based on an integration of the well-known chance-constrained programing with a possibilistic programing approach. Small size problems are solved to optimality. In order to solve large size instances, a meta-heuristic algorithm was applied and its performance is evaluated in comparison with a new lower bound approach through analysis of a real case-study of a HAZMAT transportation network.

Designing a face recognition system is a complex task due to the wide variety of illumination, pose, and facial expression. A lot of approaches have been developed to find the optimal space in which face feature descriptors are well distinguished and separated. Face representation using Gabor features and discrete wavelet has attracted considerable attention in computer vision and image processing. We describe in this paper a face recognition system using artificial neural networks like multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) where Gabor and discrete wavelet based feature extraction methods are proposed for the extraction of features from facial images using two facial databases: the ORL and computer vision.

Since its development over forty years ago, however, the end-points have not benefited from multiple interfaces installed for redundancy purposes in the underlying equipment. In the case of failure, the logical connection has been broken or stalled. In order to remedy this situation, a multipath version of TCP - MPTCP - has recently been elaborated. It allows for simultaneous use of a set of transmission paths and interfaces, yet requires appropriate means of coordination. This paper presents a discrete-time model of data exchange process subject to MPTCP master control and provides a new flow control algorithm for the paths with diverse parameters, e.g., different delays. The algorithm establishes a feasible (non-negative and bounded) input signal and finite data queue length despite uncertain networking conditions.

The parameter uncertainties are assumed to be time-varying norm bounded, which appears on the system state and input matrices. The robust guaranteed cost control laws presented in this article include both continuous feedback controllers and intermittent feedback controllers, which were rarely found in the literature. The proposed guaranteed cost finite-time control is designed in terms of a set of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs) to steer the coupled neural networks to achieve finite-time synchronization with an upper bound of a guaranteed cost function. Furthermore, open-loop optimization problems are formulated to minimize the upper bound of the quadratic cost function and convergence time, it can obtain the optimal guaranteed cost periodically intermittent and continuous feedback control parameters.

Relative bid privacy leads to three advantages: high efficiency, the bidding values can be very precise and any auction rule can be applied.

Since the DNN model requires significant storage and computation resources, various energy efficient DNN accelerators or algorithms have been proposed for edge devices. Many quantization algorithms for efficient DNN training have been proposed, where the weights in the DNN layers are quantified to small/zero values, therefore requiring much fewer effective bits, i.e., low-precision bits in both arithmetic and storage units. Such sparsity can be leveraged to remove non-effective bits and reduce the design cost, however at the cost of accuracy degradation, as some key operations still demand a higher precision. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a universal mixed-precision DNN accelerator architecture that can simultaneously support mixed-precision DNN arithmetic operations. A big-little core controller based on RISC-V is implemented to effectively control the datapath, and assign the arithmetic operations to full precision and low precision process units, respectively. Experimental results show that, with the proposed designs, we can save 16% chip area and 45.2% DRAM access compared with the state-of-the-art design.

Event-triggered state estimation for Markovian jumping impulsive neural networks with interval time-varying delays	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL												This paper investigates the event-triggered state estimation problem of Markovian jumping impulsive neural networks with interval time-varying delays. The purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate system states through available output measurements. In the neural networks, there are a set of modes, which are determined by Markov chain. A Markovian jumping time-delay impulsive neural networks model is employed to describe the event-triggered scheme and the network- related behaviour, such as transmission delay, data package dropout and disorder. The proposed event-triggered scheme is used to determine whether the sampled state information should be transmitted. The discrete delays are assumed to be time-varying and belong to a given interval, which means that the lower and upper bounds of interval time-varying delays are available. First, we design a state observer to estimate the neuron states. Second, based on a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple-integral terms and using an improved inequality, several sufficient conditions are derived. The derived conditions are formulated in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities , under which the estimation error system is globally asymptotically stable in the mean square sense. Finally, numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and superiority of the results.

Sensors periodically sample a physical quantity of interest and report their measurements to a data center. A spatially continuous estimate of the quantity can then be constructed through interpolation. 'Design' involves deciding upon how many sensors are needed and where exactly to deploy them. The very nature of the interpolation application precludes the use of sensing range notions. An additional challenge is how to design without relying on prior knowledge about the statistics of the physical phenomenon. In this paper, we present a complete methodology for the design problem in spatial interpolation. Our objectives include minimizing the spatial average of the distortion or the maximum distortion over space incurred through interpolation. Evaluation with synthetic sensor network data shows that significant reductions in the number of necessary monitoring locations are possible compared to simpler design methods.																					978-1-4244-3516-6				2009							133	138																WOS:000290931100023

Recent studies show that, the temporal characteristics of emotions play an important role in the success of automatic recognition. Also, the use of different signals (facial expressions, bio-signals, etc.) is important for the understanding of emotions. In this study, we propose a multi-modal method based on feature-level fusion of human facial expressions and electroencephalograms (EEG) data to predict human emotions in continuous valence dimension. For this purpose, a recursive neural network (LSTM-RNN) with long short-term memory units is designed. The proposed method is evaluated on the MAHNOB-HCI performance data set.																			2165-0608		978-1-5386-1501-0				2018																								WOS:000511448500382

The network Quality-of-Service (QoS) in NCSs always fluctuates due to changes of the traffic load and available network resources. To handle the network QoS variations problem, this paper presents an intelligent scheduling control method for NCSs, where the sampling period and the control parameters are simultaneously scheduled to compensate the effect of QoS variation on NCSs performance. For NCSs with network-induced delays and packet dropouts, a discrete-time switch model is proposed. By defining a sampling-period-dependent Lyapunov function and a common quadratic Lyapunov function, the stability conditions are derived for NCSs in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on the obtained stability conditions, the corresponding controller design problem is solved and the performance optimization problem is also investigated. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

The algorithm iteratively minimizes a criterion function that contains a sigmoidal activation term. We have altered their algorithm to bring it in line with Hopfield's original network by reducing the pseudotemperature of the sigmoid. We found that smaller values of the pseudotemperature lead to faster convergence to a solution and resulting solutions that are more accurate.																			1545-598X					OCT	2004	1	4					318	321		10.1109/LGRS.2004.836258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2004.836258													WOS:000208325400019

The channel fading phenomenon is considered, where the fading rates are depicted by a random variable distributed over a certain interval with known statistical properties. Different from the reported relevant results, all subsystems of the considered switched fuzzy delayed systems can be unstable. To conquer the faultiness of the existing min-switching mechanism for switched delayed systems in discrete-time domain, the improved state-dependent switch-ing paradigm and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) are constructed. As a result, suffi-cient conditions with less conservativeness are formulated. In addition, we have shown that the concerned filtering error system is asymptotically mean-square stable (AMSS) and possesses a standard "2 performance level. Finally, the superiority and practicability of the proposed design approach are corroborated through the provided simulation examples.

J	Li, Y				Li, Yan			Artificial Neural Network Model for Indoor Decoration Intelligence Calculation and Automation Design	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE												With the continuous development of science and technology, the indoor decoration industry has gradually changed toward mechanization, specialization, and intelligent direction. Based on the predecessor research, this study proposes an artificial neural network model for indoor decoration intelligence calculation and automation design. Based on scales, walls, doors, windows, and other specific components, digital image processing technology implements automatic identification of the apartment graph and completes the preprocessing of the floor plan map. Combined with the indoor decoration data set, the automated design model based on an artificial neural network is established, and the network structure and training process of the model are analyzed. Finally, the bedroom and the living room were experimentally designed. The results showed that as the number of training increased to 30 times, the MAE and MSE assessment indicators gradually decreased, and the error of the model was very small and gradually stabilized. This shows that artificial neural network automation design is better; second, artificial neural network algorithms can generate multiple layout schemes within 1 minute. The design layout is efficient and the plan is reasonable. It meets all requests such as circulation, openness, lighting, and functionality, saving a lot of human and time and providing users with more choices.																			1687-5265	1687-5273				JUN 24	2022	2022								2246211	10.1155/2022/2246211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/2246211								35785051					WOS:000834156700021

In WSNs with static base stations, sensor nodes close to the base station dissipate most of their energies for relaying other sensor nodes' data. Although cooperation among the sensor nodes results in longer network lifetimes in comparison to greedy approaches, there is an inherent limit on the achievable network lifetime due to the limited energy of the sensor nodes in close proximity of the base station acting as relays. Base station mobility is proposed as a remedy for the WSN hot spot problem. As the base station relocates, the burden of relaying the data coming from all sensor nodes can be shared by a larger set of nodes. To take advantage of base station mobility to maximize the network lifetime, determining the optimal mobility pattern is of utmost importance. In this study, we investigate the impact of using three base station mobility patterns which are random mobility, grid mobility, and spiral mobility. To avoid the shadowing effects of specific protocols or algorithms we build a novel Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) framework which enables us to explore the design space under optimal operating conditions.

Flying Ad Hoc Network has high mobility, and the users can communicate without the help of human intervention. Due to high mobility in FANET, network performance is to be concentrated more. Designing a routing protocol is the most important metric for continuous monitoring, analyzing the network performance, and improve efficient network communication. Design of routing protocol should fulfill the important criteria like neighbor nodes selection, shortest path, traffic control, high scalability, high reliability, high data delivery, low drop rate, lesser delay, and high throughput. Due to the high speed in FANET, routing protocols are to be focused on the improvement of network performance and quality of services. This research work studies the detailed review of suitable routing protocols for Flying Ad hoc Networks and discussed the possible outcomes of the different routing strategies such as source-initiated data-centric, table-driven, hybrid, multipath, location-aware, multicast, geographical multicast, power-aware, and energy-aware. This research study suggested the important metrics be concentrated on designing the efficient routing protocol for Flying Ad Hoc Networks and on improving the quality of services.

Both static event-triggering scheme (SETS) and adaptive event-triggering scheme (AETS) are presented for discrete-time nonlinear and linear systems. What makes AETS different from SETS is that an auxiliary dynamic variable satisfying a certain difference equation is incorporated into the event-triggering condition. The sufficient conditions of asymptotic stability of the closed-loop event-triggered control systems under both two triggering schemes are given. Especially, for the linear systems case, the minimum time between two consecutive control updates is discussed. Also, the quantitative relation among the system parameters, the preselected triggering parameters in AETS, and a quadratic performance index are established. Finally, the effectiveness and respective advantage of the proposed event-triggering schemes are illustrated on a practical example. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A decay function of the dynamic sliding mode surface which can decay to zero in the finite time is constructed. Thereby, the dynamic sliding mode surface can evolve into the linear sliding mode surface at the given time. Thus, the method not only is strong global robustness, but also can quicken the response of the system and shorten the transition time. The method can be applied in the tension control system of the time delay carbon fiber multilayer diagonal loom. Simulation results prove the validity of the method.																			2169-3536						2017	5						15326	15331		10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2734805	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2734805													WOS:000408176800039

First, we introduce the synchronization error dynamics and transform the problem of mixed H-2/H-infinity synchronization control of coupled partial differential systems into the problem of mixed H-2/H-infinity stabilization of the synchronization error dynamics. Then, both the finite and infinite horizon cases for the mixed H-2/H-infinity synchronization control are considered. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence of the solutions to the mixed H-2/H-infinity synchronization control problem are given via a standard completing square technique. When the states of the synchronization error systems are unavailable, the Lunberger observer is designed, and the observer-based mixed H-2/H-infinity synchronization problem is investigated. Based on the solutions to the coupled differential Riccati equations, the optimal control for the observer-based mixed H-2/H-infinity synchronization control is presented.

Sustainable and individual utilization concepts have to be developed for the upcoming available resource. Studies conclude that there is low potential for hardwoods in the traditional appearance market thus the application areas have to be extended to new structural innovative products. This paper examines the extension to a future laminated beech wood supply network which would be a combination of already existing and new production facilities. For a better future use of hardwood raw materials it is necessary to consider the entire supply chain. This also better shows a total hardwood value chain. Therefore, this paper provides data to the solid hardwood business and develops a mixed integer linear programming to design a laminated beech wood supply network. The model is applied to Austria as the sample region. It covers the important strategic decisions where to locate a downstream facility within the existing production network with the lowest supply network cost. Fourteen scenarios are developed to examine various future network configurations. Results about optimal material flows and used sawmills as well as downstream production facilities are presented in form of material and financial performances. Two optimal laminated beech production locations are determined by the calculated scenarios results, and the impact of a new sawmill is analyzed which is focused on beech.																			0037-5330	2242-4075					2019	53	3							10074	10.14214/sf.10074	http://dx.doi.org/10.14214/sf.10074													WOS:000489275200002

It considers a distributed system composed of different stages connected by material links labeled with suitable performance indices. A hierarchical procedure employing direct graph (digraph) modeling, mixed integer linear programming, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is presented to select the optimal DN configuration. More in detail, a first-level DN optimization problem taking into account the definition and evaluation of the distribution chain performance provides a set of Pareto optimal solutions defined by digraph modeling. A second level DN optimization using the AHP method selects, on the basis of further criteria, the DN configuration from the Pareto face alternatives. To show the method effectiveness, the optimization model is applied to a case study describing an Italian regional healthcare drug DN. The problem solution by the proposed design method allows improving the DN flexibility and performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, based on the Taylor expansion theory, we derive a general Zhang et al. discretization (ZeaD) formula, i.e., a general Taylor-type 1-step-ahead numerical differentiation rule for the first-order derivative approximation, which contains two free parameters. Based on the bilinear transform and the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, the effective domain of the two free parameters is analyzed, which can ensure the convergence of the general ZeaD formula. Secondly, based on the general ZeaD formula, we design a general six-step discrete-time ZNN (DTZNN) for time-varying tensor absolute value equations (TVTAVEs), whose steady-state residual error changes in a higher order manner than those presented in the literature. Meanwhile, the feasible region of its step size, which determines its convergence, is also studied. Finally, experiment results corroborate that the general six-step DTZNN model is quite efficient for TVTAVE solving.

In this paper an imperfect mixing at Double T-junction model is developed considering 3-D mixing behavior. A reduced model is then constructed in the form of a 1-D law to apply it to current 1-D transport models for water distribution networks. The methodology to create such law is detailed and can be applied to any reduced model problem including multi parameters and time consuming simulations. The procedure is composed of three steps: first calibrate the Kriging interpolation method parameters; then couple it with the Delaunay triangulation method to select simulation points with maximum gain; and finally implement a 1-D law based on the simulation results and the interpolation.

Temporal Network Optimization Subject to Connectivity Constraints	ALGORITHMICA												In this work we consider temporal networks, i.e.networks defined by a labeling assigning to each edge of an underlying graphG a set of discrete time-labels. The labels of an edge, which are natural numbers, indicate the discrete time moments at which the edge is available. We focus on path problems of temporal networks. In particular, we consider time-respecting paths, i.e.paths whose edges are assigned by a strictly increasing sequence of labels. We begin by giving two efficient algorithms for computing shortest time-respecting paths on a temporal network. We then prove that there is a natural analogue of Menger's theorem holding for arbitrary temporal networks. Finally, we propose two cost minimization parameters for temporal network design. One is the temporality of G, in which the goal is to minimize the maximum number of labels of an edge, and the other is the temporal cost of G, in which the goal is to minimize the total number of labels used. Optimization of these parameters is performed subject to some connectivity constraint. We prove several lower and upper bounds for the temporality and the temporal cost of some very basic graph families such as rings, directed acyclic graphs, and trees.																			0178-4617	1432-0541				APR	2019	81	4					1416	1449		10.1007/s00453-018-0478-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00453-018-0478-6													WOS:000465431800005

Ensemble incremental learning Random Vector Functional Link network for short-term electric load forecasting	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS												Short-term electric load forecasting plays an important role in the management of modern power systems. Improving the accuracy and efficiency of electric load forecasting can help power utilities design reasonable operational planning which will lead to the improvement of economic and social benefits of the systems. A hybrid incremental learning approach composed of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Random Vector Functional Link network (RVFL) is presented in this work. RVFL network is a universal approximator with good efficiency because of the randomly generated weights between input and hidden layers and the close form solution for parameter computation. By introducing incremental learning, along with ensemble approach via DWT and EMD into RVFL network, the forecasting performance can be significantly improved with respect to both efficiency and accuracy. The electric load datasets from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed incremental DWT-EMD based RVFL network. Moreover, the attractiveness of the proposed method can be demonstrated by the comparison with eight benchmark forecasting methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The polytope type uncertainties are considered in the plants. Different from previous related works, a novel guaranteed cost control strategy has been put forward in this paper. The novelty and challenge lie in that the quantized state and quantized input are included in the guaranteed cost function. Through introducing some auxiliary scalars and combining with the S-procedure, new criteria are developed for the robust stability and guaranteed cost performance for discrete time systems with state and input quantizations.

In this method, the mesh reflector antenna was divided into two parts: the internal cable network and the external truss. Through continuous iterations between the pretension of the cable network and the deformation of the external truss, a set of optimal pretension can be found based on satisfying the equilibrium state of the whole structure. Compared with the conventional pretension design method based on rigid truss assumption, this method can fully consider the compatible deformation between the external truss and the internal cable network to obtain a high surface accuracy reflector. This method can effectively avoid the tension readjustment to save manpower and material resources and applies to the pretension design for asymmetric offset-feed mesh reflector antenna. The case studies illustrate the necessity of considering the truss flexibility in the pretension design and demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.																			1000-758X					APR 25	2023	43	2					155	164		10.16708/j.cnki.1000-758X.2023.0030	http://dx.doi.org/10.16708/j.cnki.1000-758X.2023.0030													WOS:000969023400015

In particular, the continuous engineering paradigm of gradually perfecting a DNN-based perception can make the previously established result of safety verification no longer valid. This can occur either due to the newly encountered examples (i.e., input domain enlargement) inside the Operational Design Domain or due to the subsequent parameter fine-tuning activities of a DNN. This paper considers approaches to transfer results established in the previous DNN safety verification problem to the modified problem setting. By considering the reuse of state abstractions, network abstractions, and Lipschitz constants, we develop several sufficient conditions that only require formally analyzing a small part of the DNN in the new problem. The overall concept is evaluated in a 1/10-scaled vehicle that equips a DNN controller to determine the visual waypoint from the perceived image.																					978-3-9819263-5-4				2021							1478	1483		10.23919/DATE51398.2021.9473994	http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/DATE51398.2021.9473994													WOS:000805289900277

This research develops a generic mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) for reverse logistics network design. This is a multi-echelon reverse logistics model. It maximizes total profit by handling products returned for repair, remanufacturing, recycling, reuse, or incineration/landfill. A hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the problem. The designed model is validated and tested by using a real-life example of recycling bulk waste in Taoyuan City, Taiwan. Sensitivity analyses are conducted on various parameters to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed model. Post-optimality analysis and comparison show that the proposed model performs better than current reverse logistic operations and the proposed hybrid GA demonstrates the efficiency of solving the complex reverse logistics problem.

Continuous time SMC is used as a robust control methodology which is digitally implemented through a computer. Further, the communication delay in the network is modeled in the form of a zero order hold (ZOH) acting in the control loop. Simulation is done by taking different hold times of the ZOH with the SMC designed as per the traditional Gao's reaching law technique and the recently developed band approach technique.

J	Zhang, H; Wang, JM				Zhang, Hui; Wang, Junmin			State Estimation of Discrete-Time Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems in a Network Environment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS												In this paper, we investigate the H-infinity filtering problem of discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems in a network environment. Different from the well used assumption that the normalized fuzzy weighting function for each subsystem is available at the filter node, we consider a practical case in which not only the measurement but also the premise variables are transmitted via the network medium to the filter node. For the network characteristics, we consider the multiple packet dropouts which are described by using a Markov chain. It is assumed that the filter uses the most recent packet. If there are packet dropouts occurring, the filter adopts the information for the last received packet. Suppose that the mode of the Markov chain is ordered according to the number of consecutive packet dropouts from zero to a preknown maximal value. For each mode of the Markov chain, it only has at most two jumping actions: 1) jump to the first mode and the current packet is transmitted successfully and 2) jump to the next mode and the number of consecutive packet dropouts increases by one. We aim to design mode-dependent and fuzzy-basis-dependent T-S fuzzy filter by using the transmitted packet subject to the described network issue. With the augmentation technique, we obtain a stochastic filtering error system in which the filter parameters and the Markovian jumping variable are all involved. A sufficient condition which guarantees the stochastic stability and the H-infinity performance is derived with the Lyapunov method. Based on the sufficient condition, we propose the filter design method and the filter parameters can be determined by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A tunnel-diode circuit in a network environment is presented to show the effectiveness and the advantage of the proposed design approach.

The proposed design can cope with arbitrarily discrete membership functions. It is a combination between a Kohonen network used for clustering the fuzzy data and a set of low degree rational fuzzy approximators. The self-organizing system works in fuzzy arithmetic and uses a specific training strategy that combines fuzzy and defuzzified data streams. A genetic algorithm trains the rational fuzzy approximators by using the local fuzzy data cluster. The performance of the piecewise rational fuzzy approximator is experimentally evaluated and compared with other types of techniques for approximating fuzzy dependencies with regard to the achieved accuracy and the required computing time.																					978-0-7695-3078-9				2007							433	+		10.1109/SYNASC.2007.23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SYNASC.2007.23													WOS:000264583000063

However, there are other important conflicting objectives that hinder the process of efficient network design. This study proposes a multi-objective optimization model for reliable communication flow networks, including maximizing the network reliability, minimizing total cost, and maximizing network flow, simultaneously. The total cost comprises the cost of construction of network arcs and the cost of flow, while arcs may fail to operate in full-capacity and may only function to a fraction of their capacity. The reliability-based network-design is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming and solved by three metaheuristic multi-objective methods namely multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and two versions of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (Le., NSGA-II and NSGA-III). In order to select the best compromise solution from the Pareto front members, a fuzzy-based mechanism is utilized.

This serious issue needs a sophisticated real-time system solution to avoid the massive consequences of landslides like destruction of infrastructure, life and property losses, etc. The main reason behind increase in landslide occurrence is impact of change in climate and the increasing human activities on the environment. Landslide prediction in whole is continuous process. The system comprises of three stages viz. locating landslide prone areas, deployment of a real-time system in the prone area and finally continuous monitoring, analysis and prediction of risk. This paper introduces various types of sensors which can be used for continuous landslide risk monitoring of hazard areas including discussions related to various wireless sensor networking techniques.																					978-1-5090-3294-5				2017																								WOS:000428694800268

In many relevant routing algorithms it is assumed or required that each node is able to know useful information about the global nodes during the networking cycle, and obtaining this information requires huge additional consumption. Thus it is necessary to design a routing algorithm that relies only on local information to improve the energy balance of the network. In order to improve the uniformity of energy consumption of wireless sensor networks when nodes are not able to know global information, a local equilibrium cluster routing protocol based on a mixed strategy game is proposed. The algorithm constructs a utility function by defining the gain and loss of nodes in the game through their residual energy and using a penalty mechanism to shorten the campaign iteration time. Based on this, the equilibrium probability of the game model is obtained by defining an iterative operation to maximize the utility of local nodes. In order to avoid more than one cluster head in the neighborhood as much as possible, a second round of campaigning mechanism for candidate cluster heads is used. Simulation experimental results show that the protocol can reduce the network energy consumption to a certain extent and thus extend the network lifetime.																					978-1-6654-3441-6				2021										10.1109/RASSE53195.2021.9686895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/RASSE53195.2021.9686895													WOS:000782441400045

This design aims to maximize the sum rate achieved by ground users (GUs) through optimizing the UAV placement, IRS phase shifts, and sub-channel assignments considering the wireless backhaul capacity constraint. To tackle the underlying mixed integer non-linear optimization problem (MINLP), we first derive the closed-form IRS phase shift solution; we then optimize the sub-channel assignment and UAV placement by using the alternating optimization method. Specifically, we propose an iterative sub-channel assignment method to efficiently utilize the bandwidth and balance bandwidth allocation for wireless access and backhaul links while maintaining the backhaul capacity constraint. Moreover, we employ the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to solve the UAV placement optimization sub-problem.

The FTTH network design can be formulated as a Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problem with Boolean variables. However, many well-defined optimization approaches for BIP problems developed in the literature cannot be directly applied in network planning due to the complexity of planning model. To address this, the model of GPON planning has been transformed with a standard structure, and the resultant model can be solved efficiently based on the Lagrangian Heuristic method.

Observer-based hybrid triggered control design for cluster synchronization of nonlinear complex dynamical networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING												The issues of cluster synchronization and state estimation for a class of nonlinear complex dynamical networks are concurrently focused in this study. In precise, led by the design of complex dynamical networks, a proportional integral-based observer is implemented for achieving robustness, by the virtue of which the states of examined networks are estimated. Thereupon, a proportional integral observer-based hybrid triggered control scheme is proposed, wherein, the switch-over between time- and event- triggered scheme is governed through a Bernoulli distributed random variable. Further, with the application of mixed H-infinity and passivity performance technique, the external disturbances for the addressed complex dynamical networks are reduced. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the requisite sufficient conditions in respect of linear matrix inequalities are provided which ensures the discussed complex dynamical network's synchronization phenomenon. In a further, the presented criteria are exploited for the attainment of required controller, proportional and integral gain matrices.

J	Berkel, F; Liu, S				Berkel, Felix; Liu, Steven			An Event-Triggered Output-Based Model Predictive Control Strategy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL OF NETWORK SYSTEMS												In many of today's control systems, the control loop is closed over a communication network with limited resources that requires explicit consideration of the network utilization in the controller design. At first, this paper deals with the decentralized control of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems consisting of multiple dynamically coupled subsystems subject to state and input constraints where the sensors send the measurements over a network to the controllers. A novel design for an event trigger mechanism for reducing the communication effort over the network in combination with an output-based model predictive controller is proposed. The approach is enhanced with another event trigger for a configuration where additionally the controllers send the inputs to the actuators over the network. Furthermore, it is discussed how the scheme can be extended for the control of sampled-data systems and how the network imperfections bounded time-varying delays, and sampling intervals can be considered in the design. Recursive feasibility of the control law and exponential stability of the origin are guaranteed for all considered setups. Illustrative examples demonstrate the clear reduction of the communication effort compared to a time-triggered output-based model predictive controller.

Considering the measurement failures caused by the complexed space environment during the measuring procedure, this paper proposes a novel dual vector quaternions based mixed artificial neural network estimating algorithm (DVQ-MANN) to estimate the parameters of the uncooperative space target. Firstly, the dual vector quaternions (DVQ) are utilized to set up the relative kinematics and dynamics model. When the measurements are available, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) of the DVQ-MANN will operate to accomplish parameter estimations. When the measurements failures occur, the artificial neural networks(ANN) of the DVQ-MANN will work. In the designed DVQ-MANN, the first ANN is a three-layer feedforward neural network to estimate the states of the uncooperative space target. Besides, a novel deep convolution neural network is designed to estimate the covariance matrix of the states for its advantages in processing high dimensional inputs.

One of the remarkable features of this paper lies in the fact that a convergence rate O ( 1=t(2)) could be yielded by using the proposed distributed algorithm if, some suitable conditions are satisfied. Specifically, by using the smooth approximation method, a kind of distributed algorithm is proposed to deal with the optimization problem with non-smooth cost functions or cost functions having nonLipschitz gradient. The asymptotic convergence property and the convergence rate of the proposed distributed algorithm are analyzed under certain mild conditions. A numerical simulation is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.

The idea is to use the ADP algorithm to obtain the optimal control input that makes the performance index function reach an optimum. The expression of the performance index function for the chaotic system is first presented. The online ADP algorithm is presented to achieve optimal control. In the ADP structure, neural networks are used to construct a critic network and an action network, which can obtain an approximate performance index function and the control input, respectively. It is proven that the critic parameter error dynamics and the closed-loop chaotic systems are uniformly ultimately bounded exponentially. Our simulation results illustrate the performance of the established optimal control method.

Then, robust optimization methods are applied to construct robust models under three situations of uncertainty. For the computational complexity of large-scale problems, an enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm (EBDA) is designed. A numerical case analysis is conducted using five different scale instances. First, compared to other algorithms, EBDA accelerates the solution efficiency while ensuring convergence. Secondly, the sensitivity of the objective weights and the trade-offs of multiple objectives are analysed. Finally, the impact is analysed of the uncertain environment, CSR, an FRS, an FSS and a VSS on the CLSC network. Decision makers need to balance three objectives to manage CLSC and use these strategies appropriately to address the negative impact of an uncertain environment.

Several methodologies and techniques have been developed to achieve optimal costs in mixed material heat exchanger networks. This paper demonstrates the application of two decomposition methodologies (total decomposition and partial decomposition) for typical cost rules. The objective function was defined as the optimization and minimization of the total annual cost in mixed materials heat exchanger network. Three optimization algorithms, hybrid genetic-particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) techniques, and ant colony optimization (ACO), were used to further optimize the total cost in mixed materials heat exchanger network. The results indicate that the total annual cost in partial decomposition method was smaller than that in full integration method and total decomposition method. The reduction of the total annual cost was about 27% for GA-PSO algorithm, 24% for SFLA and 10% for ACO relative to the results reported in this work. In partial decomposition method, at least one mixed material of heat exchanger was used to reduce the hot and cold utility for decreasing the total annual cost. Partial decomposition method resulted in the highest reduction of the total annual cost compared with other methods. Percentage of difference of the total annual cost were 0.36%, 1.92%, and 5.05% for full integration, total decomposition, and partial decomposition methods, respectively, in comparison with the previous studies. Results have been compared with the results of other studies to demonstrate the accuracy of the applied algorithms.

This paper proposes an approach that utilizes a mixed-integer nonlinear programming formulation to estimate and identify kinetic rate parameters from a postulated superset of reactions. The proposed methodology can be applied to steady state systems, or dynamic systems through explicit derivative estimation. An adaptive design of experiments methodology is proposed to facilitate intelligent sampling across the experimental domain. The proposed methodology is applied to three problem settings: isothermal CSTRs where initial concentrations are varied to learn the reaction network, dynamic chemical looping combustion reactors where semi-empirical mechanistic models are used to model catalyst conversion, and an expanded example that considers alternative reaction mechanisms and stoichiometric relationships and applies the proposed adaptive sampling technique to a higher dimensional domain.

The discrete-time n-port passivity of the shared virtual object (SVO) is presented when n SVO copies are distributed on an undirected and connected communication topology with unreliable data transmission. Wave nodes as passive network elements can be implemented on multilateral wave-based communication architecture to passively distribute power across the network. In this note, the wave node scheme introduced in [16] is employed to construct a passive wave-based network architecture in order to passively interconnect multiple discrete-time port-Hamiltonian local SVO copies alongside their coordinating controllers. The performance analysis shows that the proposed network architecture: (i) possesses n-port passivity over a network with time-varying delay and packet-loss; (ii) is lossless when subjected to communications with no time delay; and (iii) offers less dissipation comparing to the network structures built based on the node scheme proposed in [18]. Simulations in which a VO is shared among four peers across a network with constant and varying time-delay validate the analysis.

J	Goyal, R; De Gruttola, V				Goyal, Ravi; De Gruttola, Victor			Dynamic network prediction	NETWORK SCIENCE												We present a statistical framework for generating predicted dynamic networks based on the observed evolution of social relationships in a population. The framework includes a novel and flexible procedure to sample dynamic networks given a probability distribution on evolving network properties; it permits the use of a broad class of approaches to model trends, seasonal variability, uncertainty, and changes in population composition. Current methods do not account for the variability in the observed historical networks when predicting the network structure; the proposed method provides a principled approach to incorporate uncertainty in prediction. This advance aids in the designing of network-based interventions, as development of such interventions often requires prediction of the network structure in the presence and absence of the intervention. Two simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of generating predicted networks when designing network-based interventions. The framework is also illustrated by investigating results of potential interventions on bill passage rates using a dynamic network that represents the sponsor/co-sponsor relationships among senators derived from bills introduced in the U.S. Senate from 2003 to 2016.																			2050-1242	2050-1250				DEC	2020	8	4					574	595	PII S2050124220000247	10.1017/nws.2020.24	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/nws.2020.24								36035743					WOS:000575822100006

Multiscale modeling of semiflexible random fibrous structures	COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN												Biological as well as manmade materials with fibrous microstructures are ubiquitous in everyday life. At a certain length scale of observation, these materials appear in the form of a random network of crosslinked (connected) filaments. The computational effort required for investigating the mechanics of these structures by modeling the deformation of each fiber is very large. Therefore, a proper representation of their overall mechanical properties requires developing multiscale schemes capable of describing the behavior of the discrete system with a continuum model without loss of essential microstructural details. This article discusses two approaches developed for solving boundary value problems on large fiber-network domains using scale coupling techniques. We present first considerations related to sequential multiscale modeling, in particular linked to the scale of transition from a discrete to a continuum model of the network. Further, we review a method designed to construct a continuum model for the network structure, which takes into account the intrinsic spatial correlations of network properties. In both techniques, the geometrical and structural properties of network constituents at micro-scales are considered in estimating the macro-scale behavior of the structure subjected to external loads.

Transceiver characteristics, asymmetric interference, and many other properties of the electromagnetic propagation environment result in link unidirectionality, however, transmission power heterogeneity is the dominant factor that creates unidirectional links. Most of the data transfer mechanisms designed for wireless networks work only on bidirectional links, yet, there are some mechanisms capable of utilizing unidirectional links. Employment of a multi-hop reverse path for acknowledgement delivery is the key concept and hop length of the reverse path is an important design criterion in such mechanisms. If the maximum reverse path length is allowed to take large values then the number of usable unidirectional links increases. Increasing the number of available links leads to better energy balancing and longer network lifetime. But is it necessary to keep the reverse path length large to achieve the maximum network lifetime possible? In this study, we investigate the effects of reverse path length in WSNs with unidirectional links induced by transmission power heterogeneity on network lifetime through a novel mixed integer programming framework. Our results show that reverse path length has significant impact on WSN lifetime.

It exploits the application of signal-interference principles to a class of transversal filtering section made up of two in-parallel discrete-element transmission lines. This circuit network, through destructive and constructive signal-energy interactions, enables high-selectivity filtering actions to be generated. Moreover, this can be done in the same circuit topology independently of the type of transfer function to be synthesized. Design equations and guidelines for this lumped-element analog filter approach are given.

Nevertheless, the existence of scarce resources and the derived application complexity, impose significant constraints and requires high design expertise. Consequently, the probability of discovering design errors, once the application is implemented, is considerably high. To address these issues, there is a need for the availability of early-stage validation, performance evaluation and rapid prototyping techniques at design time. In this paper we present a novel approach for the co-design of mixed software/hardware applications for distributed sensor network systems. This approach uses BIP, a formal framework facilitating modeling, analysis and implementation of real-time embedded, heterogeneous systems. Our approach is illustrated through the modeling and deployment of a Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN) application. We emphasize on its merits, notably validation of functional and non-functional requirements through statistical model-checking and automatic code generation for sensor network platforms.

The WDS problem is well known for its poor solution efficiency and difficulty in finding global optimal solution due to the nonconvex head loss equations. To address the nonconvex issue, the head loss equations are rigorously reformulated into convex inequalities. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) method is applied to facilitate the convexification. The proposed model is formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. Since the model is convex and rigorously formulated, global optimality is guaranteed. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated by a benchmark example.

Drawing on synthetic control experiments, social network analysis, and case studies, we test whether the design of these committees' policies or the traits of these committee networks improved the recovery trajectories of municipalities.

J	Roth, P				Roth, Philip			Including the Diary Method in the Investigation of Practices Constituting Social Innovation Networks	HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG												Organizing the early stage of the innovation process, and hence the development of ideas, is of considerable importance for the success of an enterprise. During this stage, decision making is particularly difficult because of both high complexity and high uncertainty. At the same time, these decisions are far reaching because the outcome of the early stage has a substantial influence on the results of subsequent stages. Social network research shows that specific network constellations in particular favor the development of ideas. To promote the development of these constellations, the dynamics of networks have to be understood. However, the insights that have been gained so far are insufficient. To go beyond these insights in the article, initially a research question is developed from a practice-theoretical point of view. The research aim is to explore the constitutive conditions of the practices of initiating and conducting idea-related interactions in the early stage of the innovation process. Subsequently, the article critically examines the given methodological approaches of social network research. It is demonstrated here that the existing research gap is essentially the result of two central methodological shortcomings. To overcome these shortcomings, a mixed-method design that links the diary method with established methods of qualitative network research is proposed and discussed.

As a universal approximator, the neural network is widely utilized to solve the tracking control problem of unknown continuous nonlinear systems. Due to the existence of neural network approximation errors, previous neural network-based control approaches can only achieve the bounded tracking rather than the asymptotic tracking. This paper designs an asymptotic error eliminating term to achieve the adaptive neural asymptotic tracking. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory, all the variables of the resulting closed-loop system are proven to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error can converge to zero asymptotically by choosing design parameters appropriately. A simulation example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.																			2169-3536						2019	7						97365	97373		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926264													WOS:000480317700001

Once the non-linear BPNN is properly trained, the most important variables of the continuous galvanizing process, including initial/first cooling rate (CR1), holding time at the galvanizing temperature of 460 degrees C (tg) and the final/second cooling rate (CR2), are obtained in an optimal way using an evolutionary approach. The experimental development of GDP steels in continuous processing lines with outstanding mechanical properties (550 < YS < 750 MPa, 1100 MPa < UTS and 10% < EL) is possible by using a combined hybrid approach based in BPNN and multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA).

Our discussion concentrates on the interplay between different types of models, in particular coupling of differing spatial dimensions, and the associated spatial discretization of thermally and electrically active structures.																					3-7643-2192-X				2003	146						187	201																WOS:000189215000012

Core-Edge design of storage area networks-A Single-edge formulation with problem-specific cuts	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH												Optimization and heuristic methods for the design of medium to large storage area networks (SANs) are in the early stages of development, but are required if large clustered storage systems are to become a viable alternative to expensive monolithic storage. We present here a new mixed-integer formulation for optimal design of a Storage area network. Our formulation models the Single-edge Core-Edge topology. Using a testbed of medium to large problems, we compare the solution times for our new formulation to the current benchmark in the literature-our formulation solves in significantly less time with an off-the-shelf optimization software package. We also generate problem-specific cuts to further reduce the solution time for our formulation. An algorithm, which includes an integer programming subproblem, is described for generating some of these cuts. For all test problems, the cuts yield a further reduction in the solution time.

The communication network via which the data is propagated is unsafe and the malicious adversary can attack the system during state feedback. By considering random Denial-of-Service attacks, a new sliding mode variable is designed, which takes into account the distribution information of the probabilistic attacks. Then, by resorting to Lyapunov theory and stochastic analysis methods, sufficient conditions are established for the existence of the desired sliding mode controller, guaranteeing both reachability of the designed sliding surface and stability of the resulting sliding motion. Finally, a simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sliding mode control algorithm.

The learning component of the proposed controller can use an arbitrary function approximator such as a Polynomial, Radial Basis, or Neural Network to directly learn the inverse of the input-state mapping of the plant while forcing its state to track a prescribed desired trajectory. Unlike most of the existing direct adaptive or learning schemes, the nonlinear plant is not assumed to be feedback linearizable. The developed controller is subsequently applied to control the configuration of a nonholonomic differential drive robot. The simulation results of this application demonstrate a significant improvement in the tracking performance of the robot once the control input is fully learned.																			0743-1619	2378-5861	978-1-4577-0081-1				2011							3553	3558																WOS:000295376004062

A sliding-window quadratic estimation cost function is considered and the measurement noise is assumed to be additive. No probabilistic assumptions are made on the measurement noise nor on the initial state. Novel theoretical convergence results are developed for the error bounds of both the optimal and the neural approximate estimators. To ensure the convergence properties of the neural estimator, a minimax tuning technique is used. The approximate estimator can be designed off line in such a may as to enable it to process on line any possible measure pattern almost instantly.

The research on product design changes has gradually shifted from the component level to the product feature level. Therefore, the components are divided into feature level, and a product feature network is built to analyse the propagation of changes. Because it is not unique to divide features of the component, three-dimensional (3D) entities are used to transit components into 2D features. The strong and weak ties are defined according to the relationship between the divided features, the product feature network is constructed by the divided features and defined ties. Three discrete states of feature nodes are defined based on the change propagation model and the meaning of change propagation index (CPI) in the feature network is proposed. By analysing two types of product feature change propagation and calculating its change probability, the impact of change propagation in the network can be evaluated. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model is verified by constructing a featured network of a pumping unit and analysing its change propagation.

J	Haas, I; Bekhor, S				Haas, Inbal; Bekhor, Shlomo			A parsimonious heuristic for the discrete network design problem	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE												The problem of selecting the optimal set of transportation projects out of a given set of projects, known as the network design problem (NDP), has been researched for many years. Typical transportation projects are interdependent in their nature, which turns the problem into a very complex one. When a certain objective is sought, an exact solution of the problem can be derived only by enumerating each possible project combination. Therefore, when a large set of possible combinations is involved an alternative approach must be taken. Meta-heuristic methods usually used for this purpose do not make use of the special properties of the given problem. This paper proposes an alternative heuristic that simplifies significantly the solution process. The benefit of a certain combination of projects is inferred based on a subset (pairs or triplets) of projects. The proposed heuristic is tested on simple networks and applied for a real-size network. The paper also discusses the trade-offs between solution accuracy and computation time.

Firstly, a novel Refined Feature Extraction Block (RFEB) is proposed in the Down-sampling Unit, which uses two depth-separable convolution blocks as the main branch and introduces a feature calibration path branch and a residual branch to perform refined feature extraction of the original face images. Secondly, in order to further reduce the number of network parameters, a novel Double Branch Distillation Fusion Block (DBDFB) is designed, which uses two branches to process the features extracted in the down-sampling stage respectively. Finally, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) are used to extract and retain high-frequency detail information of face images. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art face super-resolution algorithms using only a few parameters.

Thermodynamic study was performed using the potentiometric data based on extended ion interaction Pitzer-Archer model in various mixed solvent systems containing 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40% mass fractions of formamide and glucose at T = 29821 K and 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0% mass fractions of proline at T = 308.2 K and ambient pressure over ionic strength ranging from 0.0014 to 3.9579 mol.kg(-1). The adjustable parameters were determined and the obtained results were then interpreted based on extended ion interaction Pitzer-Archer model. In addition, artificial neural network was used to model and to predict the mean ionic activity coefficients of KCl in the (water + formamide/glucose/proline) mixed solvent systems. The mean absolute deviation of the designed neural network in prediction of the mean ionic activity coefficients was about 0.0083. Therefore, the artificial neural network can efficiently predict the activity coefficients of electrolyte in mixed solvent systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The first PA design covers 19-29.5 GHz, while the other two designs cover 23-41 GHz, all covering multiple 5G bands (24/28/37/39 GHz). All the presented PA designs are based on a proposed transformer-based continuous-mode harmonically tuned PA output network. This network provides proper harmonic impedance terminations for the fundamental, second-order, and third-order harmonic impedances, which supports continuous-mode Class-F-1 or hybrid Class-F/F-1 PA operations to achieve ultrawide bandwidth yet high efficiency. The first PA design achieves a wide P-sat 1-dB bandwidth of 19-29.5 GHz (43.3%) and high peak power-added efficiency (PAE) (43.5%). The second design achieves an ultrawide P-sat 1-dB bandwidth of 23.5-41 GHz (53.3%) and high peak PAE (46%). Moreover, it achieves 43.4% PAE and 18.6-dBm P-sat at 27 GHz, 40.2% PAE and 18.6-dBm P-sat at 37 GHz, and 41.2% PAE and 18.5-dBm P-sat at 39 GHz, respectively. The third PA design also achieves an ultrawide P-sat 1-dB bandwidth of 23.5-41 GHz (53.3%) and high peak PAE (43.2%). It achieves 43% PAE and 18.9-dBm P-sat at 27 GHz, 37% PAE and 19-dBm P-sat at 37 GHz, and 36% PAE and 18.9-dBm P-sat at 39 GHz, respectively. Extensive 64-/256-QAM modulation tests demonstrate the high PA linearity. Our proposed PA designs outperform the reported mm-wave silicon-based 5G PAs in terms of high efficiency over an ultrawide bandwidth.

Robust Semantic Segmentation for Automatic Crack Detection Within Pavement Images Using Multi-Mixing of Global Context and Local Image Features	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS												Accurate identification of cracks at the pixel level on intricate asphalt pavements represents a crucial challenge in the domain of intelligent pavement assessment. The current advanced deep-learning networks encounter limitations in simultaneously capturing both the global context and local features of cracks, leading to discontinuous segmentation results and suboptimal recovery of local details. This paper proposes a robust architecture named Mix-Graph CrackNet to present an efficacious solution for this challenge. The Mix-Graph CrackNet, as proposed, is designed to mix the global context and local features multiple times, allowing for a comprehensively understanding of the essential features. Specifically, this paper develops the learnable parallel convolutional-Transformer mixing module to parallelly capture the sophisticated local features as well as the crucial global context. In addition, a new fusion unit is devised in the paper and deployed in the learnable parallel convolutional-Transformer mixing module. The proposed fusion unit is capable of effectively mixing contextual features extracted at both global and local scales while retaining an abundant level of textural details germane to the crack. Moreover, this paper constructs a graph-based skip connection that functions as a shortcut connecting the encoder and decoder, with the primary objective of mitigating information decay. The experimental results are remarkable, with the Mix-Graph CrackNet achieving F-measure and Intersection-Over-Union of 90.37% and 82.43%, respectively, on 1000 testing images. Based on the performance evaluations conducted on both public and private datasets, the proposed Mix-Graph CrackNet architecture demonstrates a significantly superior detection accuracy in comparison to several state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation.

We assume that the occupancy state of each channel is correlated with that of the other channels, and the spectrum occupancy state for all the channels follows the discrete-time Markov model. In this paper, we propose to characterize the channel availability of the primary network using the idle probability of consecutive time slots (IPCOTS). Under the discrete-time Markov model, we derive the IPCOTS of each particular channel, under the condition that the states of all the channels in the primary network are identically distributed. Moreover, we propose a suboptimal state-dependent policy, called IPCOTS policy, for the selection of channel sensing order. Finally, we extend the policy to three typical cases. Simulation results show that, in an M/M/m/m-modeled primary network, more secondary user (SU) rewards can be obtained using the IPCOTS policy in comparison with the existing approaches.																			1053-587X	1941-0476				MAY 1	2016	64	9					2443	2458		10.1109/TSP.2016.2516972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2516972													WOS:000373947500021

Selective tightening algorithm for the optimization of pipeline network designs in the energy industry	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Energy industries face the challenge on how to design networks to gather flows from unconventional assets due to the relative short lifetime of the wells. The optimal design of the network of pipelines and processing facilities is a challenging problem from both combinatorial and nonlinear viewpoints. To date, real instances of this problem cannot be solved to global optimality unless simplifying assumptions are made. We propose a systematic algorithm to address the optimal planning of gathering networks in a multiperiod horizon. It relies on the strategic selection of links on which fluid-dynamic equations are imposed. By relaxing constraints, the resulting mixed-integer programming models are still complex from the combinatorial standpoint, but they can be solved in reasonable computational times. The algorithm progressively adds constraints to the potential arcs, seeking for the global optimal solution by selectively tightening relaxations. Results show that computational times can be reduced by two orders of magnitude.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for stability are obtained. In addition, the packet dropping margin as a measure of stability robustness of a system against packet loss is defined and its formula is derived.

Design and Optimization of Capacitated Supply Chain Networks Including Quality Measures	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												This paper presents (1) a novel capacitated model for supply chain network design which considers manufacturing, distribution, and quality costs (named SCND-COQ model) and (2) five combinatorial optimization methods, based on nonlinear optimization, heuristic, and metaheuristic approaches, which are used to solve realistic instances of practical size. The SCND-COQ model is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem which can be used at a strategic planning level to design a supply chain network that maximizes the total profit subject to meeting an overall quality level of the final product at minimum costs. The SCND-COQ model computes the quality-related costs for the whole supply chain network considering the interdependencies among business entities. The effectiveness of the proposed solution approaches is shown using numerical experiments. These methods allow solving more realistic (capacitated) supply chain network design problems including quality-related costs (inspections, rework, opportunity costs, and others) within a reasonable computational time.

J	Lin, JS				Lin, JS			Fuzzy possibilistic neural network to vector quantizer in frequency domains	OPTICAL ENGINEERING												The fuzzy possibilistic c-means (FPCM) is embedded into a 2-D Hopfield neural network termed the fuzzy possibilistic Hopfield network (FPHN) to generate an optimal solution for vector quantization (VQ) in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the Hadamard transform (HT) domains. The information transformed by DCT or HT is separated into dc and ac coefficients. Then, the ac coefficients are trained using the proposed methods to generate a better codebook based on VQ. The energy function of the FPHN is defined as the fuzzy membership grades and possibilistic typicality degrees between training samples and codevectors. A near global-minimum codebook in the frequency domains can be obtained when the energy function converges to a stable state. Instead of one state in a neuron for the conventional Hopfield nets, each neuron occupies two states called the membership state and the typicality state in the proposed FPHN. The simulated results show that a valid and promising codebook can be generated in the DCT or HT domains using the FPHN.

This study used both quantitative data and qualitative texts to explore older women's social networks. The mixed-methods design drew participants from the 1921-26 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). Regression modelling for repeated measures was used to analyse the longitudinal data. The qualitative data was content analysed by the themes identified from the quantitative analyses. The quantitative analyses revealed that larger social networks associated with better mental health, widowhood, illness or death of a family member, and no mobility problems. Women who were not Australian-born, had sight problems or who had moved house were more likely to have smaller social networks. The qualitative data provided insight into the lived experiences of this group of women. The use of a mixed methodology enabled the longitudinal quantitative results to be enriched by the women's own words. The findings highlight the importance to older women of being able to access their social network members to gain the psychological and emotional benefits.

J	Baskan, O				Baskan, Ozgur			An Evaluation of Heuristic Methods for Determining Optimal Link Capacity Expansions on Road Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION												Since the bilevel formulation of the Continuous Network Design Problem (CNDP) has the characteristic of a non- convex optimization problem, heuristic methods are usually the preferred option for solving it. On the other hand, the computation time is crucial importance for solving the CNDP because the algorithms implemented on real sized networks require solving traffic assignment model many times, in which algorithms spend more time in comparison with the other parts of the solution process. Therefore, solving the CNDP with less number of traffic assignments can be assessed as one of the most important topics in the transportation field. Thus, the paper deals with analyzing the performance of recently developed heuristic methods in solving the CNDP. In this study, the capability of Harmony Search (HS), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms for solving the CNDP is evaluated, and numerical calculations are performed on example test networks. The results obtained through the HS, ABC and DE algorithms on 18-link network are compared with those generated by two different heuristic methods, which are available in a previous study. Additionally, the performance of the proposed heuristics is compared on Sioux Falls city network with other major algorithms available in the literature. Numerical examples have clearly indicated that the DE shows good performance in comparison with the proposed algorithms in terms of both objective function value and required computational effort.

Multioctave Bandwidth of Parallel-Feeding Network Based on Impedance Transformer Concept	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION												A generalized scheme to design a parallel-feeding network with a bandwidth of several octaves for uniform distribution arrays is proposed. Considering the entire network as a continuous impedance-transition device between the feed and all element ports, and therefore applying the design methods of the impedance transformer on the device, a broad matching bandwidth can be achieved without the traditional quarter-wavelength T-junctions concept. Three feeding networks based on the binomial and Chebyshev polynomial and exponential taper transformers for a 4 x 4 patch array are designed for demonstration, verification, and comparison of the proposed concept. An experimental sample of the taper network is fabricated and tested, and a fractional bandwidth better than 3: 1 can be achieved. This method is not limited to the specific form of transmission lines and can perform even better for grander scale arrays.

J	Chen, P; He, SB				Chen, Peng; He, Songbai			A 0.4-2.3GHz broadband power amplifier extended continuous class-F design technology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS												A 0.4-2.3GHz broadband power amplifier (PA) extended continuous class-F design technology is proposed in this paper. Traditional continuous class-F PA performs in high-efficiency only in one octave bandwidth. With the increasing development of wireless communication, the PA is in demand to cover the mainstream communication standards' working frequencies from 0.4GHz to 2.2GHz. In order to achieve this objective, the bandwidths of class-F and continuous class-F PA are analysed and discussed by Fourier series. Also, two criteria, which could reduce the continuous class-F PA's implementation complexity, are presented and explained to investigate the overlapping area of the transistor's current and voltage waveforms. The proposed PA design technology is based on the continuous class-F design method and divides the bandwidth into two parts: the first part covers the bandwidth from 1.3GHz to 2.3GHz, where the impedances are designed by the continuous class-F method; the other part covers the bandwidth from 0.4GHz to 1.3GHz, where the impedance to guarantee PA to be in high-efficiency over this bandwidth is selected and controlled. The improved particle swarm optimisation is employed for realising the multi-impedances of output and input network. A PA based on a commercial 10W GaN high electron mobility transistor is designed and fabricated to verify the proposed design method. The simulation and measurement results show that the proposed PA could deliver 40-76% power added efficiency and more than 11dB power gain with more than 40dBm output power over the bandwidth from 0.4-2.3GHz.

Enhancing low-priority traffic reconfiguration designs in mixed-critical avionics networks	IET COMMUNICATIONS												In avionics system networking, mixed-critical networks are commonly used to integrate system applications with different levels of guarantees for various traffic classes on a shared resource platform, effectively addressing issues such as cabling, cost, weight, volume, power consumption, etc. However, current fault recovery and reconfiguration techniques mainly focus on high-priority time-triggered (TT) traffic, often neglecting the impact of TT traffic reconfiguration on low-priority traffic. This paper proposes an avionics mixed-critical networking approach based on the IEEE 802.1CB protocol, which is shown to be more effective for the post-failure recovery of Rate-Constrained (RC) traffic (a typical type of low-priority traffic in TT networks). Furthermore, an elastic reconfiguration algorithm is presented to ensure quality of service for RC traffic during and after reconfiguration, preventing arbitrary application and traffic shutdown triggered by TT traffic reconfiguration. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach and algorithm can significantly improve the post-failure recovery ratio of RC traffic, as well as guarantee quality of service and network throughput of RC traffic during and after reconfiguration to a certain extent.					李, 继/IAQ-4558-2023	李, 继/0000-0002-0119-8667													1751-8628	1751-8636				AUG	2023	17	13					1524	1540		10.1049/cmu2.12639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/cmu2.12639		JUN 2023											WOS:001001176000001

A systems approach to scalable transportation network modeling	Proceedings of the 2006 Winter Simulation Conference, Vols 1-5					2006 Winter Simulation Conference	DEC 03-06, 2006	Monterey, CA	IEEE				Emerging needs in transportation network modeling and simulation are raising new challenges with respect to scalability of network size and vehicular traffic intensity, speed of simulation for simulation-based optimization, and fidelity of vehicular behavior for accurate capture of event phenomena. Parallel execution is warranted to sustain the required detail, size and speed. However, few parallel simulators exist for such applications, partly due to the challenges underlying their development. Moreover, many simulators are based on time-stepped models, which can be computationally inefficient for the purposes of modeling evacuation traffic. Here an approach is presented to designing a simulator with memory and speed efficiency as the goals from the outset, and, specifically, scalability via parallel execution. The design makes use of discrete event modeling techniques as well as parallel simulation methods. Our simulator, called SCATTER, is being developed, incorporating such design considerations. Preliminary performance results are presented on benchmark road networks, showing scalability to one million vehicles simulated on one processor.

The proposed design supports three functional modes-normal FMA mode, mixed FMA mode, and dual FMA mode-and four types of precision-single-precision (SP), half-precision (HP), BFloat16 (BF16), and TensorFloat-32 (TF32)-based on the practical requirements of deep learning applications. In the normal FMA mode, conventional FMA operations, one SP operation or two parallel HP operations, are performed every clock cycle. In the mixed FMA mode and dual FMA mode, mixed-precision operations, the fused multiply-accumulate and the dot-product, are implemented, respectively. Specifically, the product of lower precision multiplication can be accumulated to a higher precision addend. Compared with the mixed FMA mode, the throughput is doubled in the dual FMA mode due to the full utilization of the multiplier operand bandwidth. In addition to FMA operations, numerical precision conversion (NPCvt) is also supported in this work: higher precision FMA results can be converted into lower precision numbers, corresponding to the datatype transform in the datapath of deep neural network (DNN) training. The FMA design presented herein uses both the segmentation and reusing methods to trade off performance, such as throughput and latency, against area, and power. Compared with the state-of-the-art multiple-precision FMA unit, the proposed design supports more types of floatingpoint operation and NPCvt, with higher throughput and lower hardware overhead.

With regard to the inertial neural networks described by a second-order differential equation, an appropriate variable substitution is applied to transform the original system into a first-order differential system. Considering that the data transmissions are proceed in the shared band-limited digital communication networks when designing a controller to achieve synchronization. In order to alleviate the burden of networked communication, a controller based on an event-triggered strategy is used to achieve this goal. Furthermore, a non-fragile controller design scheme governed by Bernoulli distribution is proposed to deal with the uncertainty that may occur in the implementation process of the designed controller. Then, on the basis of the Lyapunov stability theory and an improved inequality technique, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that the error system meets the extended dissipative synchronization. Finally, two examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The network is designed using MATLAB software R2014b and various faults such as high impedance, symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault have been applied to study the effectiveness of the proposed ANFIS classifier method. This is achieved by training the ANFIS classifier using the features (standard deviation values) extracted from the three-phase fault current signal by DWT technique for various cases of fault with different values of fault resistance in the system. The success and discrimination rate obtained for identifying and classifying the high impedance fault from the proffered method is 100% whereas the values are 66.7% and 85% respectively for conventional fuzzy based approach.

The overall model of a distributed object computing system has clearly separated hardware and software components enabling co-design engineering. The software component models form a distributed cooperative object (DCO) model to represent interacting software objects. The hardware component models form a loosely coupled network (LCN) model of processing nodes, network gates, and communication links interconnecting them. The software objects of the DCO are then "distributed" across the processors of the LCN to form a distributed object computing system (DOC) model. This approach facilitates design analysis of each of these components separately as well as the combined systems behavior. The Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism is used to implement dynamic models of the DCO components, LCN components, and experimental frames to analyze system behavior.																			0277-786X		0-8194-3170-2				1999	3696						147	157		10.1117/12.351172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.351172													WOS:000081823700014

However, since deep neural network requires a high cost on memory consumption and computation, implementation scenarios of these interpretation methods are constrained to nonportable devices. Few commercial portable devices only have heartbeat detection ability, and therefore, only a few simple cardiac diseases can be diagnosed. In this article, to achieve diagnosing a wide range of cardiac diseases and continuous monitoring, a homecare-oriented ECG diagnosis platform is designed based on a large-scale multilabel deep conventional neural network. The accuracy of the proposed neural network model is guaranteed by our constructed large-scale ECG dataset, which is comprised of 206 468 standard 12-lead ECG recordings from 89 488 patients, with respect to 26 types of most common heart rhythms and conduction abnormalities. Meanwhile, targeting lightweight homecare or wearable applications, algorithm-hardware co-optimization is conducted to accelerate the model computation on an embedded platform with field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for continuous monitoring. Channel-level pruning and parameters quantization strategy are employed to optimize the network, and a reconfigurable accelerator hardware architecture is designed to accelerate the convolution computation on FPGA. The final quantified model achieved a promising score of 0.913 & x0025; and 86.7 & x0025; exact match ratio, in which parameters and floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) are significantly penalized compared to the original large-scale model. Real-time analysis is performed. Specifically, the average processing time for each ECG record is 2.895 s, and it can be applied to homecare or portable ECG diagnosis devices for continuous monitoring.					cheng, Cheng/HTS-8243-2023	Zhu, Hongling/0000-0002-0695-2569; Yong, Zhang/0000-0002-1537-4588; Yang, Xiaoyun/0000-0002-7326-4387													0018-9456	1557-9662					2022	71								2503113	10.1109/TIM.2022.3147328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2022.3147328													WOS:000766300200140

Performance Bounds on State-Feedback Controllers with Network Delay	47TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL, 2008 (CDC 2008)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control				47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	DEC 09-11, 2008	IEEE Control Syst Soc (CSS), Cancun, MEXICO	IEEE, Soc Ind & Appl Math (SIAM), Inst Operat Res & Management Sci (INFORMS), Japanese Soc Instrument & Control Engn (SICE), European Union Control Assoc (EUCA), Taylor & Francis Grp, StatoilHydro	IEEE Control Syst Soc (CSS)			This paper describes a convex optimization approach to bound the performance degradation of control systems subject to network loop delay. We consider a linear time-invariant continuous-time plant connected over a communication network to a remote controller. The network introduces bounded but time-varying delays between the controller and plant. We establish an upper bound on the worst-case performance degradation due to the network delays as a function of the delay bound, which can be used as a design parameter for the networked implementation. Numerical simulation results illustrate the degree of conservativeness of the bound.																			0743-1546		978-1-4244-3124-3				2008							4608	4613		10.1109/CDC.2008.4739330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739330													WOS:000307311604120

Stability and stabilization for discrete-time systems with time-varying delays via augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS												This paper is concerned with the stability and stabilization problems for discrete-time systems with interval time-varying delays. By construction of an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and utilization of zero equalities, improved delay-dependent criteria for asymptotic stability of the systems are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on the proposed stability criteria, a sufficient condition for designing feedback gains of time-delayed controllers which guarantee the stability of the concerned system is presented. Through three numerical examples, the effectiveness to enhance the feasible region of the proposed criteria is demonstrated. (C) 2012 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This problem is to determine capacity expansions of existing links in order to minimize the total travel cost plus the investment cost for link capacity improvements, when the link flows are constrained to be in equilibrium. We used the model of mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (MPCC) for the CENDP and recast it as a DC (Difference of Convex functions) program with DC constraints via the use of a penalty technique. A DCA (DC Algorithm) was developed to solve the resulting problem. Numerical results indicate the efficiency of our method vis-a-vis some existing algorithms.

From object recognition to object grasping motion, the motion execution should be as fast as possible. Due to the possible position variation of the target object to be grasped, online planning of grasping motion should be done. In order to achieve flexible grasping motion, recurrent neural network could be implemented as an alternative to conventional manipulation method which is based on kinematic and dynamic analysis. However, the application of recurrent neural network model requires good and easily obtainable training data. Hence, a novel robotic arm design with high flexibility is proposed to facilitate the training and implementation of the recurrent neural network model. The feasibility of the proposed robotic arm design is evaluated via the training, learning and testing of stochastic continuous time recurrent neural network (S-CTRNN) model with grasping a box motion.

We propose a neural network-based approach to topology optimization that aims to reduce the use of support structures in additive manufacturing. Our approach uses a network architecture that allows the simultaneous determination of an optimized: (1) part segmentation, (2) the topology of each part, and (3) the build direction of each part that collectively minimize the amount of support structure. Through training, the network learns a material density and segment classification in the continuous 3D space. Given a problem domain with prescribed load and displacement boundary conditions, the neural network takes as input 3D coordinates of the voxelized domain as training samples and outputs a continuous density field. Since the neural network for topology optimization learns the density distribution field, analytical solutions to the density gradient can be obtained from the input-output relationship of the neural network. We demonstrate our approach on several compliance minimization problems with volume fraction constraints, where support volume minimization is added as an additional criterion to the objective function. We show that simultaneous optimization of part segmentation along with the topology and print angle optimization further reduces the support structure, compared to a combined print angle and topology optimization without segmentation.

We call the function that extracts blobs (image regions) in a given image and exhibits them in a time series "dynamic image segmentation". It is known that a locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator network (LEGION) described by ordinary differential equations is an interesting dynamic image-segmentation system using synchronization of coupled oscillators. On the other hand, we developed a discrete-time oscillator network that can perform dynamic image segmentation by synchronizing the oscillatory responses that are formed by periodic points in dynamics of discrete-time oscillators. Compared with LEGION, the proposed system can significantly reduce a computational cost because it does not need unnecessary numerical integration; moreover, we can design the suitable values of the system parameters for dynamic image segmentation on the basis of analyzed results on bifurcations of fixed and periodic points. In this paper, we describe how the topological property of a fixed point corresponding to non-oscillatory responses that are unsuitable for dynamic image segmentation in the proposed system gives significant information on the structure of regions in a given binary (black and white) image. We also suggest a novel way to identify the number of image regions without performing a segmentation process.

NDA has materialised in different methodological proposals for qualitative analysis and recently in mixed method qualitative-quantitative designs. As a continuation of this line of inquiry, this paper proposes a new method of analysis of the narrative text from qualitative interviews, which is a new application of NDA in a mixed methods version that combines qualitative and quantitative analysis tools. In a first phase of qualitative analysis, the conceptual links that the interviewee makes in his narration are interpreted and transformed into large semantic networks of the key themes. In the second phase of analysis, the networks are examined and interpreted by combining their analysis with quantitative faction and cliques indicators typical of social network analysis, using the analytical-interpretive criteria of the researcher. The method involves analysis of the formal structure of the text, understood as a structured unit of meanings, which allows its meaning to be captured in a complete and rigorous way. The concept is illustrated by applying it to the analysis of a biographical narrative interview.																			0210-2862	2013-9004					2022	107	4							e3081	10.5565/rev/papers.3081	http://dx.doi.org/10.5565/rev/papers.3081													WOS:000893197700008

In order to evaluate the OSPF and RIP's scalability performance, several network models are designed and con figured with the OSPF and RIP, in combination with the BGP. Evaluations of the proposed routing protocols are performed based on the metrics, such as the execution time, convergence time, turnaround time, throughput, and efficiency across an increasing size and complexity through the simulated network models. The evaluation results show that the OSPF routing protocol provides a better scalability performance than the RIP routing protocol for Internet applications.

In a parallel connected filter network, each resonator represents one of the poles of the admittance parameters and is independent of the others, thus the dissipation of each resonator can be considered separately. It is observed that some of the resonators are more critical than the others in determining the filter performance. These resonators have to be designed with high-Q technologies while the unloaded Q of the others can be reduced. Gradient-based optimization is used for determining the Q distribution that provides a flat passband insertion loss, as well as a good return loss. The design theory will be presented along with examples of networks, which clearly show that high-performance filters may be constructed with a minimum number of high-Q resonators. Examples using mixed coaxial and microstrip technology are presented.

In this paper, we consider location design and relocation problems for sharing a mixed fleet of cars and propose integer linear programs that incorporate both one-way and round-trip demand and operations. To model car movements, we use a minimum-cost flow model on a spatial-temporal network given time-based demand. We maximize the total profit of renting cars minus the cost of relocation and maintenance, subject to limited budget for purchasing cars and given a CO2 emission limit. In addition, we enforce the first-come, first-served principle to eliminate denied trips. We conduct computational studies based on 2014 Zipcar data in Boston to provide insights for fleet location, car-type designs, and their environmental impacts. Our results show high utilization of cars and low demand losses and denied trips. Although the CO2 emission limit may lower car-sharing profit, high demand on new energy-efficient cars can compensate the loss and is worth being satisfied.

However, it is challenging to achieve high resolution and ultrasmall footprint simultaneously in a spectrometer, because reducing its size results in concomitant degradation of its resolution or bandwidth. Here, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated an integrated photonic network for high-resolution spectral reconstruction. The photonic network, which consists of inverse-designed components with reduced footprints, serves as a multiport interferometer and provides the high-quality spectral fingerprint for reconstructing the input spectrum. As a result, spectral lines separated by 100 pm and continuous spectra were experimentally reconstructed from a device with an ultracompact footprint of 88 x 300 mu m2.

The lung sensor consists of 17 electrodes, and operates at 40MHz. It aims to approximate the dielectric constant of the underlying lung tissue independent of variations in the outer layers (skin, fat, muscle and bone). Concurrently, the wireless BAN is used to transmit the measured dielectric constant to a mobile device via Bluetooth for continuous remote healthcare monitoring. In this paper, we present the design and experimental validation of the proposed lung sensor integrated with wireless BAN data link.

These applications are harder to classify than conventional applications in terms of their network-service requirements. and will present new challenges to the design of the adaptation layer for ATM networks. In this paper we discuss three such challenges: the need for mixed adaptation-layer services by a single application. the need to avoid retransmissions. and the need for throughput that exceeds the link rates of most cell networks being planned.																			0140-3664					FEB	1993	16	2					77	82		10.1016/0140-3664(93)90014-J	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0140-3664(93)90014-J													WOS:A1993KG59000003

Optimal Bayesian Classification and Its Application to Gene Regulatory Networks	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON GENOMIC SIGNAL PROCESSING AND STATISTICS (GENSIPS)	IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics				IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics (GENSIPS)	DEC 02-04, 2012	Washington, DC	IEEE, EMB, IEEE Signal Proc Soc				A recently proposed Bayesian theory of classification can incorporate prior knowledge in the model to facilitate optimization and analysis for both classifier design and error estimation. Rather than rely on heuristic algorithms, this work is inspired by Wiener filtering in that it clearly states modeling assumptions and uses these to find optimal operators. The theory also gives rise to a sample-conditioned MSE, a new and useful tool for validating a proposed classifier. Herein, we summarize the theory and present an example classifying between normal and mutated gene regulatory networks based on the observed state of several genes. Partial prior knowledge is built into a discrete model, resulting in an optimal Bayesian classifier that can significantly outperform the popular discrete histogram rule.

Thus, there is a need to incorporate multiple-channel distribution in the network design of supply chains (SCs). Design/methodology/approach A multiple-channel distribution supply chain network (MCDSCN) has been proposed under omnichannel environment. This proposed model integrates online giants with local retailer's distribution network in an uncertain environment with sustainability. To incorporate sustainability, an objective function is added to reduce carbon content along with other objectives of minimization of SC cost. The model turns out to be mixed-integer linear programming model which is coded in GAMS and solved using CPLEX solver. Findings The proposed MCDSCN model is compared with conventional SCN. Furthermore, it was found that the proposed MCDSCN model has achieved significant saving in SC cost and is also more sustainable than conventional SCN. The proposed model also enables online giants to integrate their distribution network with local retailer's distribution network. Originality/value The proposed MCDSCN model is a novel approach to design flexible distribution systems. This would significantly help organizations to design their distribution network more effectively to meet global competition.

However, many of these systems impose constraints in terms of fan-in, memory, or synaptic weight precision that have to be considered during network design and training. In this paper, we present quantized rewiring (Q-rewiring), an algorithm that can train both spiking and non-spiking neural networks while meeting hardware constraints during the entire training process. To demonstrate our approach, we train both feedforward and recurrent neural networks with a combined fan-in/weight precision limit, a constraint that is, for example, present in the DYNAP-SE mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. Q-rewiring simultaneously performs quantization and rewiring of synapses and synaptic weights through gradient descent updates and projecting the trainable parameters to a constraint-compliant region. Using our algorithm, we find trade-offs between the number of incoming connections to neurons and network performance for a number of common benchmark datasets.

J	Chen, SJ; Chen, YJ				Chen, Shengjie; Chen, Yanju			Designing a resilient supply chain network under ambiguous information and disruption risk	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												In case of supply chain disruption following severe disasters, many supply chains tend to collapse and take a long time to recover. Resilient supply chain network design (RSCND) is an important research problem in supply chain management, which means that the supply chain can maintain continuous supply and quickly restore the supply capability in part destruction. Based on the limited distribution information of uncertain demand, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model with ambiguous chance constraint (ACC) is proposed to solve the RSCND problem under demand uncertainty and disruption scenario to provide decision support for planning the supply chain network. Finally, to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed DRO model, we apply the method to a real case study in Wuhan, China, about designing a resilient RSC network to withstand disruption. By comparison and sensitivity analysis in numerical experiments, some management insights of industry decision-makers are obtained.

J	Jenkins, WM				Jenkins, WM			Structural reanalysis using a neural network-based iterative method	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING												Structural design requires a knowledge of the displacements and stress resultants occurring in a structure so that the designer can be satisfied that all functional requirements and design constraints are met. It is usual to base the first analysis on an initial design and then review the design constraints and make any desirable changes in the design data. If we continue this process we encounter a circular operation of repeated design and analysis. The process is handicapped by the dissimilar computational natures of analysis and design making integration difficult. A neural network type of computational device is suitable for continuous updating of the analysis with provision for a wide range of structural design modifications including those affecting geometry, topology, nodes, loads, supports, and material properties. The convenience in reanalysis introduced will generally require more memory in the computer and faster processing compared with the conventional approach. The practicality of the method is justified by the remarkable increases in processing speeds and memory capacities of modem computers.																			0733-9445	1943-541X				JUL	2002	128	7					946	950		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2002)128:7(946)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2002)128:7(946)													WOS:000176345000014

The design task is posed in mathematical terms as a multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, in which life cycle assessment (LCA) principles are used to quantify the environmental impact. One of the advantages of our approach is that it accounts for the simultaneous minimization of several environmental metrics, as opposed to other models that focus on minimizing a single aggregated indicator. A rigorous dimensionality reduction method based on a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is applied to aid the post-optimal analysis of the trade-off solutions. The capabilities of our approach are tested through two examples. We clearly illustrate how the use of a single overall aggregated environmental metric is inadequate in the design of HENs, since it may leave some solutions that are appealing for decision-makers out of the analysis. Our method is aimed at facilitating decision-making at the early stages of the design of HENs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Prediction of VT is usually diagnosed by using Electrocardiogram (ECG) and requires expeditious treatment which reduces the mortality rate. The cross recurrence plot (CRP) toolbox is used for computing the recurrence rate values for both (healthy and unhealthy) subjects and artificial neural network (ANN) toolbox in Matlab is used for generating the accurate results. Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used for designing the probabilistic neural network classifier for discriminating the normal from abnormal (VT) signals based on the recurrence rate values. This paper illustrates the cross recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) of ECG signals followed by the decomposition method using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for the analysis of cardiac disorders with sensitivity, specificity of 98.5% and 97.6% respectively and overall accuracy achieved is 98.7%.

However, making efficient use of the underlying resources requires effective techniques for virtual network embedding-mapping each virtual network to specific nodes and links in the substrate network. Since the general embedding problem is computationally intractable, past research restricted the problem space to allow efficient solutions, or focused on designing heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we advocate a different approach: rethinking the design of the substrate network to enable simpler embedding algorithms and more efficient use of resources, without restricting the problem space. In particular, we simplify virtual link embedding by: i) allowing the substrate network to split a virtual link over multiple substrate paths and ii) employing path migration to periodically re-optimize the utilization of the substrate network. We also explore node-mapping algorithms that are customized to common classes of virtual-network topologies. Our simulation experiments show that path splitting, path migration, and customized embedding algorithms enable a substrate network to satisfy a much larger mix of virtual networks.

Such kinds of CNDP can be formulated as a bi-level programme, in which the upper level represents the designer's decisions and the lower level the travellers' responses. Formulations of this kind can be classified as either Stackelberg approaches or Nash ones according to the relationship between the upper level and the lower level parts. This paper formulates the CNDP for road expansion based on Stackelberg game where leader and follower exist, and allows for variety of travellers' behaviour in choosing their routes. In order to solve the problem by the Stackelberg approach, we need a relation between link flows and design parameters. For this purpose, we use a logit route choice model, which provides this in an explicit closed-form function. This model is applied to two example road networks to test and briefly compare the results between the Stackelberg and Nash approaches to explore the differences between them.

Under this strategy, a novel dissipative control protocol is presented, with which the closed-loop system can be transformed into a time-delay system. Then, by Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional theory, a new dissipative criterion is established such that the resulting system is (Q, S,R)-dissipative. Correspondingly, based on this condition, the design method of the output feedback dissipative controller is proposed.

First, the node communication sequence for networked control systems with communication constraints is pre-determined by the periodical scheduling strategy, then the system can be modeled as a class of discrete-time switched systems with uncertainties, and the scheduling strategy based on performance function and dynamic dwell time determines the switching time instant. Furthermore, based on Lyapunov theory and LMI technique the controller gain and the dwell time condition is determined to ensure the stability of the system. This scheme can not only guarantee fast convergence of the system states, but also reduce the switching frequency of the system to some extent. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

In developing countries, there is a compelling need for a robust supply chain governance strategy to regulate the supply chain actors involved in the logistics and distribution system. This paper proposes an innovative way to design FAP logistics governance to address specific problems in the FAP logistics networks of developing countries, where FAP supply chains are not well integrated. Three logistics governance scenarios were modelled using discrete-event simulation. The results revealed that the fully distributed governance could effectively reduce process delay and consequently minimise logistics costs, especially within the logistics networks serving multiple markets. This is due to that fact that the distributed governance allows the actors involved in the network to have some autonomy to manage their resources. The paper contributes to improving the fundamental understanding of the governance for FAP logistics networks consisting of small-holder farms. Our work also offers valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners into how to improve FAP supply chain management.

NETmix®, A New Type of Static Mixer: Modeling, Simulation, Macromixing, and Micromixing Characterization	AICHE JOURNAL												NETmix (R) is a new technology for static mixing based on a network of chambers connected by channels. The NETmix (R) model is the basis of a flow simulator coupled with chemical reaction used to characterize macro and micromixing in structured porous media. The chambers are modeled as perfectly mixing zones and the channels as plug flow perfect segregation zones. A segregation parameter is introduced as the ratio between the channels volume and the whole network volume. Different kinetics and reactants injection schemes can be implemented. Results show that the number of rows in the flow direction and the segregation parameter control both macro and micromixing, but the degree of micromixing is also controlled by the reactants injection scheme. The NETmix (R) model enables the systematic study of micromixing and macromixing for different network structures and reaction schemes, enabling the design of network structures to ensure the desired yield. and selectivity.

Based on the threshing device of a half-feed combine harvester, the simulation model of a discrete element threshing device is established in this paper. With the threshing drum rotation speed, feed volume, and concave sieve vibration frequency as the variable factors, the BP neural network model and linear regression equation model established for the loss rate and impurity content for two kinds of threshing performance indicators, respectively, and through the discrete element threshing performance test, two kinds of methods of threshing performance prediction are analyzed. The results show that the neural network and linear regression can be used for the threshing performance indicators, however, the BP neural network prediction effect has a better prediction precision, better reliability, and the trained neural network can be used in the general case of the threshing performance indicators. This provides a new idea for improving the threshing performance of a combine harvester.					huang, yan/GWM-4747-2022; Guo, Wei/KJM-4941-2024; Huang, YQ/JOK-7580-2023	he, dongyu/0000-0003-2257-8519														2076-0825				SEP	2022	11	9							257	10.3390/act11090257	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/act11090257													WOS:000856178100001

In this paper, the sinusoidal rough-neural networks (SR-NNs) are used to identify the discrete dynamic nonlinear systems (DDNSs) with or without noise in series-parallel configuration. In the identification of periodic nonlinear systems, sinusoidal activation functions provide more efficient neural networks than the sigmoidal activation functions. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, an online learning algorithm is developed to train the SR-NNs. The asymptotically convergence of the identification error to zero and the boundedness of parameters as well as predictions are proved. SR-NNs are used to identify some DDNSs and the cement rotary kiln (CRK). CRK is a complex nonlinear system in the cement factory, which produces the cement clinker. The experiments show that the SR-NNs in the identification of nonlinear systems have better performances than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), sinusoidal neural networks, and rough MLPs, particularly in the presence of noise.

In this paper, different from traditional virtualization approaches by means of resource isolation at the subchannel or time-slot level, we propose a novel framework of heterogeneous cellular network virtualization combined with interference alignment (IA) technology, which utilizes IA to cancel the mutual interference, by aligning the interference from other transmitters into a lower dimensional subspace at each receiver. In this framework, we formulate the virtual resource allocation as a joint virtualization and IA problem, considering the gain not only from interference mitigation introduced by IA but from the sum-rate improvement brought by virtualization as well. In addition, to reduce the computational complexity, with the recent advances in discrete stochastic approximation (DSA), we propose a two-step algorithm to solve the formulated problem. The basic principle is to design IA schemes for each feasible association combination and then to traverse the association space to search for the optimal association combination with the maximum sum rate. Extensive simulations are conducted with different system parameters to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.					Yu, F. Richard/B-3182-2018	Yu, F.

In case the variable spaces are homogeneous, our setting yields a generic nonlinear mathematical programming model. When some variables belong to the real Hilbert space and others to the integer space, one obtains a nonconvex mixed-integer/-binary nonlinear programming model for which the nonconvexity is not limited to the integrality constraints. Together with the formal proof of its iteration complexity, the proposed algorithm is then numerically evaluated to solve a multi-constrained network design problem. Extensive numerical executions on a set of instances extracted from the SNDlib repository are then performed to study its behavior and performance as well as identify potential improvement of this method. Finally, analysis of the results and their comparison against those obtained when solving its convex relaxation using mixed-integer programming solvers are reported.																			1389-4420	1573-2924				2023 NOV 18	2023										10.1007/s11081-023-09867-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11081-023-09867-z		NOV 2023											WOS:001102943700001

Firstly, the Luenberger observer is designed, and additionally based on the observed states, the observer -based resilient controller is proposed. An augmented system is presented by considering both the error system and the DTMBNNs with the controller. Secondly, a novel sufficient extended exponential dissipativity condition is obtained for the augmented system with unbounded time -varying delays by proposing a system solutions -based estimation approach. This method is based on system solutions and without constructing any Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKF), thereby reducing the complexity of theoretical derivation and computational workload. In addition, an algorithm is proposed to solve the nonlinear inequalities in the sufficient condition. Thirdly, the sufficient extended exponential dissipativity condition for the augmented system with bounded time -varying delays is also obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated through two simulation examples.																			0893-6080	1879-2782				JUL	2024	175								106279	10.1016/j.neunet.2024.106279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2024.106279								38608536					WOS:001234341500001

The combustor design is strongly driven by severe emission regulations and ACARE 2020/2050 goals. Furthermore, new designs have to be developed within short turn-around times. This paper describes a novel approach of an automated preliminary aero-thermal design process of a rich-burn combustor combining 'ID, 2D and 3D design tools in order to speed up the design loop and provide improved combustor designs in an early design stage. The automated design process includes a knowledge-based preliminary design tool, an 'ID network solver, a parametric 3D geometry model, a meshing tool, and 3D-CFD analysis. At first, a preliminary combustor design is created based on industrial in-house design rules. The preliminary design tool provides a 2D geometry model and cooling layout. It is coupled with an ID network solver to calculate the air distribution inside the combustor. The design process includes two state-of-theart combustor cooling schemes, effusion cooling and impingement effusion cooling. An air flow model for both cooling schemes is created within the network, respectively. The computed air distribution is subsequently used to generate boundary conditions for a 3D-CFD analysis. To perform the CFD calculations, a parametric 3D geometry model of a combustor sector has been developed based on a 2D preliminary design which takes into account mixing port properties, fuel injector, and combustor wall cooling. After an automated meshing 3D-CFD computations are performed. As a result, quick automatic estimation of combustor emissions, size and efficiency can be obtained within the design process. A CFD parameter study of a mixing port variation and their effect on the emissions of NOx and soot is performed using the described layout process.

Then, a fully distributed event-triggered bipartite consensus (DETBC) framework is designed, where the dynamics information of MASs is no longer needed. Meanwhile, the restriction of the topology of the proposed DETBC method is further relieved. To prevent the MASs from injection attacks, neural network based detection and compensation schemes are developed. Rigorous convergence proof that the bipartite consensus error is ultimately bounded is presented.

Using the Lyapunov approach and with a novel weight updates, the uniform ultimately boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop tracking error and weight estimates are shown. The adaptive critic NN does not require an offline learning phase and the weights can be initialized at zero or randomly.

Cultivating an online teacher community of practice around the instructional conversation pedagogy: a social network analysis	ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												This mixed methods study followed an explanatory sequential design to explore the formation, development, and evolution of a formal online teacher community of practice (CoP). The online CoP supported 382 teachers as they implemented the instructional conversation (IC) pedagogy, a collaborative conversation-based pedagogy for culturally and linguistically diverse students. In the first phase, a social network analysis was conducted over 18 months to identify network attributes, patterns of engagement, node centrality measures, and evidence for homophily. This analysis served to identify two core contributors, two brokers, and two peripheral observers for in-depth interviews. In the second phase, the selected participants were interviewed to better understand their perceptions of the IC CoP and the value of their participation. In the third phase, meta-inferences were drawn based on both quantitative and qualitative findings. As a network, the IC CoP was not very dense and relied on teacher trainers to sustain engagement. As a community, the IC CoP was characterized by collaboration, mutual support, and availability of high-quality resources. Mixed evidence was found for the presence of homophily. Participants who were interviewed found personal and professional value through their participation and navigated between online and offline communities/networks. The present study reinforces the potential of online CoPs to reduce teacher isolation and foster collaboration and reflection, which may result in improved pedagogical and content knowledge. Implications about the interplay between networks and communities for teacher professional development and instructional design are discussed.

Different from existing studies, the two stochastic differential equations are applied to model the dynamics of nodes and links separately in this paper, where the stochastic factor considered in the dynamics of the links is novel. Furthermore, there have been many studies on the nodes synchronization in stochastic complex dynamic networks, but few studies on the links synchronization. In this paper, we give a definition of links synchronization in the mean-square sense, which is achieved by designing the suitable control scheme. The control scheme designed in this paper consists of two parts, one part is the design of controllers in the nodes and the other is the coupling term in the links.

First, to reduce the utilization of the network bandwidth, a novel mode-dependent continuous-time event-triggering scheme (ETS) including the state triggering error is proposed. A switching-dependent auxiliary function called the triggering sliding mode function is constructed, which prevents the controller from using the extra information (the continuous state). Then, a novel switching-dependent integral-type switching function that depends on the states of the switching instants and includes an exponential term is proposed. Obtaining the boundary of the sliding mode region benefits from the exponential term for continuous-time systems. Then, an event-triggered sliding mode controller is designed, which makes the networked switched systems practical stability, and attains the sliding region around the specified sliding surface. When the constant threshold of the triggering scheme is zero, the system state can converge to zero as time goes to infinity. Moreover, it is proved that the Zeno behavior can be avoided under the proposed continuous-time ETS. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by a switched Chua's circuit system.

To reduce GHG emissions of IP over WDM networks, we propose to maximize renewable energy usage at each network node location so as to reduce the consumption of non-renewable energy. A "Follow the Sun, Follow the Wind" strategy is proposed for the IP over WDM network to periodically reconfigure the lightpath virtual topology to enable more lightpaths to start or end at nodes where maximum renewable energy is available. We develop a mixed integer linear programming model to design new lightpath virtual topologies. Since the computational complexity of the optimization model is excessive, we also propose a simple but efficient heuristic algorithm to tackle this. Our results indicate that a network operated in this way can significantly reduce non-renewable energy consumption as illustrated in the example network scenarios considered.

In a network environment, the output measurements are supposed to be quantized with a logarithmic strategy before transmitting over the digital channels. The main difficulties in this design are as follows: (1) there exists input/output disturbances and state time-delay in the plant under consideration, such that model discretization is difficult to be implemented. The design work is therefore forbidden to be considered in continuous-time domain; (2) the quantized signals (piecewise constants) cannot be used to synthesize a continuous-time sliding mode surface; (3) traditional observer technique is not effective to handle output disturbances. In this paper, a filtering-based technique is proposed to solve these difficulties, based on which a sliding-mode observer-based control scheme is developed to stabilize the resulting closed-loop systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated via a numerical example. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) play a pivotal role in the screening of glaucoma. Therefore, accurate segmentation of OD and OC from fundus images is a key task in the automatic screening of glaucoma. In this paper, we designed a U-shaped convolutional neural network with multi-scale input and multi-kernel modules (MSMKU) for OD and OC segmentation. Such a design gives MSMKU a rich receptive field and is able to effectively represent multi-scale features. In addition, we designed a mixed maximum loss minimization learning strategy (MMLM) for training the proposed MSMKU. This training strategy can adaptively sort the samples by the loss function and re-weight the samples through data enhancement, thereby synchronously improving the prediction performance of all samples. Experiments show that the proposed method has obtained a state-of-the-art breakthrough result for OD and OC segmentation on the RIM-ONE-V3 and DRISHTI-GS datasets. At the same time, the proposed method achieved satisfactory glaucoma screening performance on the RIM-ONE-V3 and DRISHTI-GS datasets. On datasets with an imbalanced distribution between typical and rare sample images, the proposed method obtained a higher accuracy than existing deep learning methods.

To this end, a mode-dependent fault detection filter (FDF) is presented as a residual generator to detect the occurrence of the fault. As phenomena are occurring randomly via network communication, both the delays and attacks can be appropriately described by mutually independent Markov stochastic process and Bernoulli random variable, respectively. By using the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, a new sufficient condition for the H-infinity performance analysis of the augmented systems is obtained. Furthermore, and based on the obtained condition, the mode-dependent FDF that ensures the stochastic stability and a prescribed H-infinity performance level of the corresponding augmented system is designed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is presented to show usefulness of the designed mode-dependent FDF.

We propose a framework for using dynamic contracts for controlling traffic networks from temporal logic specifications. Given a traffic network, we partition it into a number of smaller sub-networks and compute a collection of assume-guarantee contracts for their dynamical interconnections. A central supervisor chooses the best contracts optimally according to the current state of the system. We use model predictive control (MPC) to find control sequences optimally for each sub-network subject to its contract obligations to and promises from its neighboring sub-networks. Our method is correct-by-design. A case study on a mixed urban-freeway network is presented, where the objective is infinite-time congestion avoidance and temporal requirements on the traffic lights in the urban intersections.

Therefore, how to design a security strategy for CCPNs under attack has become an urgent problem to be solved, which promotes our work. The problem of the distributed event-triggered synchronization of CCPNs in the presence of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is investigated in this paper. Firstly, a distributed event-triggered controller is designed such that all nodes of networks are synchronized without DoS attacks by relieving the communication occupancy rate of limited bandwidths. Meanwhile, Zeno and singular triggering behaviors are excluded to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered strategy. Secondly, in view of the continuous switching of CCPNs topologies caused by DoS attacks, an event-triggered control (ETC) strategy is proposed to ensure the synchronization of CCPNs under DoS attacks. Meanwhile, the frequency and duration of tolerable DoS attacks that can ensure the stability of the systems are calculated. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

First, we employ the multirate sampling method together with the augmented state matrix method to model the long random delay networked control systems as Markovian jump systems. Then, a H. fault detection filter is designed based on the model developed. Through the appropriate choice of the filter gain, the filter is convergent if there is no disturbance in the system, meanwhile the effect of disturbances on the residual will satisfy a prescribed H. performance. The problem of achieving satisfactory sensitivity of the residual to fault is formulated and its solution is given.

Its key features include 7x4 bit kernel memory in each MAC cell, as well as a per-kernel binary combiner that simplifies the unit cell design and enables efficient in-column ADC integration. In addition, it leverages a differential switching scheme that improves the signal swing by 4x relative to single-ended schemes, thereby reducing ADC energy.

Introducing the concept of pseudo sampling, NCS is modelled as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system. Two methods are explained to obtain a convex approximation of the uncertainty region. It is clarified how to perform the approximation to have the uncertainty space as small as possible. Using this uncertainty space, a polytopic approximation is obtained for the LPV model. The approximated model is used to synthesise a controller for set-point tracking and disturbance rejection. An observer is also synthesised based on this model. The simplicity of the model together with a small uncertainty space, results in less conservative LMI conditions. Compared to the existing results, an improved tracking performance is obtained. The final value theorem for discrete-time LTI systems with constant sampling period is extended to time varying sampling periods. This theorem is used to design a feedforward gain for zero steady-state tracking of staircase reference signals.

A dynamic system optimal dedicated lane design for connected and autonomous vehicles in a heterogeneous urban transport network	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW												Numerous contemporary studies have posited that connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hold the potential to enhance traffic safety and augment efficiency substantially. One widely discussed approach to optimize CAV operations within urban traffic networks involves the implementation of dedicated lanes (DLs). This study aims to assist system planners in optimally deploying DLs within heterogeneous urban traffic networks of CAVs and Human -Driven Vehicles (HDVs). In pursuit of this objective, we have introduced a multi -class dynamic traffic assignment framework that enhances network performance and offers insights into traffic dynamics. Additionally, our methodology considers dynamic routing behaviour while devising DLs, formulating and approximating the problem as a mixed -integer linear program (MILP). The resulting strategy delineates the temporal and spatial aspects of the deployment of DLs for CAVs, specifying the quantity and locations of these lanes. Subsequently, we assessed our framework using testbed networks of varying sizes and demand profiles, evaluating the solution's quality and the model's adaptability to diverse traffic conditions. Our findings indicate that implementing DLs for CAVs can bolster vehicular throughput across the network while neglecting dynamic capacity variation in mixed traffic may yield misleading outcomes.																			1366-5545	1878-5794				JUN	2024	186								103562	10.1016/j.tre.2024.103562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2024.103562													WOS:001239919400001

A typical classroom is selected for this study, inside which a number of wireless sensors will be installed at the breathing level to investigate the temperature profiles. By comparing with a traditional design of temperature control (i.e. temperature sensor is installed inside a return air duct), 22% (216m(3)/h) and 32% (205m(3)/h) of supply airflow rate can be saved in fully and half occupied conditions in the mixing ventilation without scarifying thermal comfort. In the displacement ventilation, even though there was no supply airflow rate saving in fully occupied condition, 15% (86m(3)/h) reduction in the supply airflow rate was achieved in half occupied condition. Therefore, the use of wireless temperature sensor network in a room temperature control may lead to a significant energy saving of the air-conditioning system. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The dynamics are transformed into the strict-feedback form. Considering the uncertainty, the neural controller is constructed based on the single-hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN). The hidden node parameters are modified using extreme learning machine (ELM) by assigning random values. Instead of using online sequential learning algorithm (OSLA), the output weight is updated based on the Lyapunov synthesis approach to guarantee the stability of closed-loop system. By estimating the bound of output weight vector, a novel back-stepping design is presented where less online parameters are required to be tuned. The simulation study is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For saving communication resources, an event-triggered approach is engaged in the design of synchronization for the delayed stochastic neural networks. To decrease network trouble, an event-triggered scheme is suggested between the sampler and communication network. A nonfragile event-triggered controller is intended to guarantee the finite-time stability of the subsequent closed-loop system. By applying the Lyapunov-Krasovkii functional (LKF) and the novel integral inequalities, a stability criteria for an interval-time varying delay error system ensure the designed controller can fulfill the necessities of passivity and passification performance. The desired control gain and event-triggered parameters are then found based on the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Since the design and maintenance of pipe networks for water supply distribution require high costs, it is mandatory to achieve the highest level of performance of the existing networks at minimum costs. The domain of variables is discrete in nature, due to the fact that pipes having unified dimensions are available. Furthermore, the objective function to be minimized, i.e., the total cost of the plant, is non linear, non differentiable, highly ill-conditioned, and presents a large amount of local minima. Genetic algorithms (GA), scatter search (SS), and tabu-search (TS) have been applied to the problem. The results show good performance of the GA in terms of objective function values, but high computation time. More promising approaches to combinatorial optimization problems are the SS and TS metaheuristics, which showed flexibility and effectiveness in applications.																					90-5809-608-4				2003							265	272																WOS:000186106300028

In a synchronous batching design, each batch of messages enters the mix network together, and the messages proceed in lockstep through the network. We show that a synchronous batching strategy can be used in various topologies, including a free-route network, in which senders choose paths freely, and a cascade network, in which senders choose from a set of fixed paths. We show that free-route topologies can provide better anonymity as well as better message reliability in the event of partial network failure.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	3-540-26203-2				2005	3424						186	206																WOS:000231114600012

J	Chairez, I				Chairez, Isaac			Finite time convergent learning law for continuous neural networks	NEURAL NETWORKS												This paper addresses the design of a discontinuous finite time convergent learning law for neural networks with continuous dynamics. The neural network was used here to obtain a non-parametric model for uncertain systems described by a set of ordinary differential equations. The source of uncertainties was the presence of some external perturbations and poor knowledge of the nonlinear function describing the system dynamics. A new adaptive algorithm based on discontinuous algorithms was used to adjust the weights of the neural network. The adaptive algorithm was derived by means of a non-standard Lyapunov function that is lower semi-continuous and differentiable in almost the whole space. A compensator term was included in the identifier to reject some specific perturbations using a nonlinear robust algorithm. Two numerical examples demonstrated the improvements achieved by the learning algorithm introduced in this paper compared to classical schemes with continuous learning methods. The first one dealt with a benchmark problem used in the paper to explain how the discontinuous learning law works. The second one used the methane production model to show the benefits in engineering applications of the learning law proposed in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cross-Layer Designs in Coded Wireless Fading Networks With Multicast	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING												A cross-layer design along with an optimal resource allocation framework is formulated for wireless fading networks, where the nodes are allowed to perform network coding. The aim is to jointly optimize end-to-end transport-layer rates, network code design variables, broadcast link flows, link capacities, average power consumption, and short-term power allocation policies. As in the routing paradigm where nodes simply forward packets, the cross-layer optimization problem with network coding is nonconvex in general. It is proved, however, that with network coding, dual decomposition for multicast is optimal so long as the fading at each wireless link is a continuous random variable. This lends itself to provably convergent subgradient algorithms, which not only admit a layered-architecture interpretation, but also optimally integrate network coding in the protocol stack. The dual algorithm is also paired with a scheme that yields near-optimal network design variables, namely multicast end-to-end rates, network code design quantities, flows over the broadcast links, link capacities, and average power consumption. Finally, an asynchronous subgradient method is developed, whereby the dual updates at the physical layer can be affordably performed with a certain delay with respect to the resource allocation tasks in upper layers. This attractive feature is motivated by the complexity of the physical-layer subproblem and is an adaptation of the subgradient method suitable for network control.

With NILM, the house does not need an additional monitoring equipment and the costs can therefore be reduced. Considering the few input features (usually aggregate power only), we proposed to use sliding windows, extracted different frequency bands through discrete wavelet transform of the power in each sliding window, and characterized the features of the middle of the sliding window, so as to perform multi-dimensional features input. The multi-dimensional inputs are put into a neural network consisting of one-dimensional convolution and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory for prediction. Also, in consideration of the states of the device switches, we designed a classification network that serves as the auxiliary network in multi-task learning, and designed the optimized loss function that works for the binary classification problem. The final output of the neural network is the product of the losses of the two subnets to achieve information sharing. The proposed feature extraction method and deep neural network were applied to the real-world household energy dataset UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity. Furthermore, we selected the F1-score, mean absolute error, and signal aggregate error as the main indicators of algorithm performance evaluation. It is found that the performance is better than what the previous researchers did with subtask gated networks, with two standard error metrics (mean absolute error and signal aggregate error), respectively, improved by 25.15% and 17.83%. In addition, the average F1-score increased by nearly 20% and the average mean absolute error and signal aggregate error decreased by 37.86% and 25.24%, respectively.																			0920-8542	1573-0484				MAY	2023	79	8					9021	9046		10.1007/s11227-022-05000-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-022-05000-6		JAN 2023											WOS:000910011900001

To reduce the computational time of optimization process, the natural frequencies of structures are evaluated using properly trained radial basis function (RBF) and wavelet radial basis function (WRBF) neural networks. In the WRBF neural network, the activation function of hidden layer neurons is substituted with a type of wavelet functions. In this new network, the position and dilation of the wavelet are fixed and only the weights are optimized. The numerical results demonstrate the robustness and high performance of the suggested methods for structural optimization with frequency constraints. It is found that the best results are obtained by VSP method using WRBF network. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Considering the mutual position disturbances among the multiple motors, two network topologies are proposed for the multiple LSRMs control system. In order to improve the tracking precision, the motor position signals are used to compensate the tracking errors among the three motors. The encodersto-controller and the controller-to-actuator time delays are modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain which denotes the whole random time delay step for the closed-loop control system. The stability conditions and the tracking controller design method for the networked LSRMs control system are proposed by using Lyapunov theory and the inequality techniques. Several groups of experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method for the networked multiple LSRMs control system.

Firstly, a novel system with augmented control is established by regarding the impulsive time as a special kind of control, which is equivalent to the considered impulsive PBCN (IPBCN).

In the first one, the nodes are coupled by their states; In the second one, the nodes are coupled by their past states or delayed states. By designing suitable pinning control schemes, several synchronization criteria are derived for these proposed network models.

To deal with this complexity, Research & Education networks (R&E) like ESnet are specifically designed to carry science traffic across the world to other R&E networks, laboratories, and experiments. Designing optimum network topologies, where traffic flow is always efficient with minimal congestion points is imperative to guarantee successful science experimentations. In ESnet, we see a large percentage of long-running flows, mixed in with deadline-driven flows and remote analysis, which makes traffic engineering (TE) particularly challenging. In this paper, we divert from traditional TE approaches and use AI to improve real-time traffic path control such to improve flow quality and network performance proposing a deployable solution, Hecate. Hecate performs a two-stage optimization process, first learning traffic profiles and network health data to predict future statistics, and second, by leveraging deep reinforcement learning to optimize path routing over many optimization objectives. Hecate is designed to optimize network utilization and performance to reduce network hotspots over an operational network.

This paper highlights how diffusion processes can facilitate coordination. I study contagion in a discrete network with Bayesian players. In addition to characterizing the extent and rate of adoption, we uncover a new effect: when large cascades are possible in equilibrium, exposure conveys information about a player's network position. This effect underscores a novel trade-off in the design of marketing campaigns, suggesting conditions under which word-of-mouth is relatively more effective.

It designs for the first time an aperiodic memory sampled-data feedback control protocol to solve extended dissipative synchronization issues of such networks.

However, these codes have a major drawback if the network contains hidden malicious nodes that can eavesdrop on transmissions and inject fake information. In this scenario, even a small amount of information injected by a single malicious hidden node could mix with and contaminate much of the information inside the network, causing a decoding error. We improve on previous work by providing a polynomial-time, rate-optimal distributed network code design that functions even in the presence of a Byzantine adversary with substantial eavesdropping capabilities. As long as the sum of the adversary's jamming rate Z(O) and his eavesdropping rate Z(I), is less than the network capacity C, (Z(O) + Z, < C), our codes attain the optimal rate of C - Z(O). The network codes we design are information-theoretically secure and assume no knowledge of network topology. Prior to transmission, no honest node knows the location or strength of the adversary. In our code design, interior nodes are oblivious to the presence of adversaries and implement a classical low-complexity distributed network code design; only the source and destination need to be changed. Finally, our codes work for both wired and wireless networks.

Although IPv6 network has significantly improved network performance, there are still a series of network failures. After the failure occurs, it is necessary for the routing algorithm to create a backup path to ensure the continuous provision of network services. So, the selection of the backup path directly determines the performance of the network service. SRv6 takes advantage of the programmable capability of the IPv6 extension header to implement differentiated reliable routing, satisfies the QoS requirements of different network services, and improves user experience. First, we design the network model for single link failure, define the network service, and design the two-dimensional flow table. Then, the backup path traversal algorithm is designed to obtain the universal set of backup paths in the network, and the optimal backup path for a specific network service is selected through comprehensive evaluation method. Experimental results show that the differentiated reliable routing mechanism proposed in this paper exhibits better performance in terms of bandwidth, delay, jitter and packet loss rate compared with the benchmark mechanism.

Value-Optimal Sensor Network Design for Steady-State and Closed-Loop Systems Using the Generalized Benders Decomposition	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												The problem of value-optimal sensor network design for linear systems has been shown to be of the nonconvex mixed integer programming class. While the branch and bound search procedure can be used to obtain a global solution, such a method is limited to fairly small systems. The bottleneck is that during each iteration of the branch and bound search, a fairly slow semi-definite programming (SDP) problem must be solved to its global optimum. In this paper, it is demonstrated that an equivalent reformulation of the nonconvex mixed integer programming problem and subsequent application of the generalized benders decomposition (GBD) algorithm will result in massive reductions in computational effort. While the proposed algorithm has to solve multiple mixed integer linear programs, this increase in computational effort is significantly outweighed by a reduction in the number of SDP problems that must be solved.																			0888-5885					OCT 18	2017	56	41					11860	11869		10.1021/acs.iecr.7b01865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b01865													WOS:000413503200021

We model water distribution networks using physical and hydraulic constraints, and formulate a joint pump scheduling and water flow problem using the hydraulic characteristics of variable speed pumps. The optimal pump scheduling and water flow problem is a mixed integer nonlinear program. This problem is generally non-convex, and hence NP-hard. We propose a second-order cone relaxation for this problem, and analytically show that the proposed relaxation is exact for a wide class of water network topologies. The proposed problem is a mixed integer nonlinear program with a linear objective function and quadratic constraints. This problem can be solved with a commercial solver such as CPLEX. Finally, we consider a real-world water network, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed relaxation in computing the optimal pump schedules and water flows.																			0743-1546		978-1-4799-7886-1				2015							5265	5271																WOS:000381554505074

Since extending the optical reach does not come for free and that reducing the power consumption has become a mandatory task for network designers, we investigate IP-over-WDM network power consumption as a function of 100 Gb/s Transponders' (TXP) transmission reach. In order to achieve this target, we propose a novel analytical model that captures the increase of TXP power consumption versus its optical reach. Network design is performed via a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization engine. We have used two Multi-Layer design strategies, the Bypass (Bp) and the Direct-Bypass (DBp), that we have both applied to the "All-On" and the "On-Off" planning approaches: the former considers that transmission devices are always on and provides an upper bound to the network power consumption whereas the latter maximizes power savings by switching network devices On-Off according to daily traffic variations. Finally, simulations on a European-like backbone network show that there exists an optical reach that leads to a minimum network power consumption, the so-called optimal reach. By performing network design at the optimal reach we can achieve up to 36% and 37% of energy savings with respect to an extended reach-based design in the All-On and in the On-Off planning respectively.

The optimization framework considers both the location and settings of control valves as decision variables. Hydraulic conservation laws are enforced as nonlinear constraints and binary variables are used to model the placement of control valves, resulting in a mixed-integer nonlinear program. We review and discuss theoretical and algorithmic properties of two solution approaches. These include penalty and relaxation methods that solve a sequence of nonlinear programs whose stationary points converge to a stationary point of the original mixed-integer program. We implement and evaluate the algorithms using a benchmarking water supply network. In addition, the performance of different update strategies for the penalty and relaxation parameters are investigated under multiple initial conditions. Practical recommendations on the numerical implementation are provided.

Both have strengths and weaknesses, respectively. This study intends to integrate them by taking the advantage of CA models' parsimonious property and discrete models' fine consideration of practical conditions. In doing so, we first employ the state-of-the-art CA models to yield the optimal design, which serves as the input to the next discrete model. Then, the stop location problem is formulated into a multivariable nonlinear minimization problem with a given number of stop location variables and location constraint. The interior-point algorithm is presented to find the optimal design that is ready for implementation. In numerical studies, the proposed model is applied to a variety of scenarios with respect to demand levels, spatial heterogeneity, and route length. The results demonstrate the consistent advantage of the proposed model in all scenarios as against its counterparts, i.e., two existing recipes that convert CA model-based solution into real design of stop locations. Lastly, a case study is presented using real data and practical constraints for the adjustment of a bus route in Chengdu (China).

While mine ventilation subsystem is the key to the colliery logistics system, the evaluation of its optimization - designing and reconstructing plans is of great significance. In this paper, a method of evaluating the mine ventilation plans is proposed based on principal component analysis (PCA) and discrete Hopfield neural networks (DHNN). Firstly, PCA method is used to reduce the dimension of mine ventilation index system. Secondly, the reference grades are stored in DHNN in the form of attractors with standardized coding. Finally, through the associative memory function of DHNN, the candidate plans are converted to the corresponding reference grades, and thus being evaluated. The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation method. Therefore, it is asserted that the proposed method is applicable to evaluate the mine ventilation subsystem comprehensively and objectively. Moreover, this method needs neither the subjective selection of index weights nor a large sample size of training set, which further improves its applicability as well as its friendliness to users.																					978-7-111-05712-3				2008							495	499																WOS:000261585600098
J	Unni, R; Yao, K; Zheng, YB				Unni, Rohit; Yao, Kan; Zheng, Yuebing			Deep Convolutional Mixture Density Network for Inverse Design of Layered Photonic Structures	ACS PHOTONICS												Machine learning (ML) techniques, such as neural networks, have emerged as powerful tools for the inverse design of nanophotonic structures. However, this innovative approach suffers some limitations. A primary one is the nonuniqueness problem, which can prevent ML algorithms from properly converging because vastly different designs produce nearly identical spectra. Here, we introduce a mixture density network (MDN) approach, which models the design parameters as multimodal probability distributions instead of discrete values, allowing the algorithms to converge in cases of nonuniqueness without sacrificing degenerate solutions. We apply our MDN technique to inversely design two types of multilayer photonic structures consisting of thin films of oxides, which present a significant challenge for conventional ML algorithms due to a high degree of nonuniqueness in their optical properties. In the 10-layer case, the MDN can handle transmission spectra with high complexity and under varying illumination conditions. The 4-layer case tends to show a stronger multimodal character, with secondary modes indicating alternative solutions for a target spectrum. The shape of the distributions gives valuable information for postprocessing and about the uncertainty in the predictions, which is not available with deterministic networks. Our approach provides an effective solution to the inverse design of photonic structures and yields more optimal searches for the structures with high degeneracy and spectral complexity.

Lee			Optimized Transmission for Parameter Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING OVER NETWORKS												A central problem in analog wireless sensor networks is to design the gain or phase-shifts of the sensor nodes (i.e. the relaying configuration) in order to achieve an accurate estimation of some parameter of interest at a fusion center, or more generally, at each node by employing a distributed parameter estimation scheme. In this paper, by using an over-parametrization of the original design problem, we devise a cyclic optimization approach that can handle tuning both gains and phase-shifts of the sensor nodes, even in intricate scenarios involving sensor selection or discrete phase-shifts. Each iteration of the proposed design framework consists of a combination of the Gram-Schmidt process and power method-like iterations, and as a result, enjoys a low computational cost. Along with formulating the design problem for a fusion center, we further present a consensus-based framework for decentralized estimation of deterministic parameters in a distributed network, which results in a similar sensor gain design problem. The numerical results confirm the computational advantage of the suggested approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods-an advantage that becomes more pronounced when the sensor network grows large.

Then, by using inequality technique and mathematical induction, the upper bound of the estimated error covariance is obtained, and the filter gain is calculated to minimize the upper bound.

The strength of this method is that it is possible to uncover the VTT distribution (and its moments) without making assumptions about the shape of the distribution or the error terms, while being able to incorporate covariates and taking the panel nature of stated choice data into account. To assess how well the proposed ANN-based method works in terms of being able to recover the VTT distribution, we first conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments. After having demonstrated that the method works on Monte Carlo data, we apply the method to data from the 2009 Norwegian VTT study. Finally, we extensively cross-validate our method by comparing it with a series of state-of-the-art discrete choice models and nonparametric methods. Based on the promising results we have obtained, we believe that there is a place for ANN-based methods in future VTT studies.																			0049-4488	1572-9435				OCT	2021	48	5					2545	2583		10.1007/s11116-020-10139-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-020-10139-3		SEP 2020											WOS:000572594100002

However, in traditional analysis methods, geometric information on the rock mass discontinuities is obtained by a geological compass and treated as an infinitely expanded plane in a numerical simulation, which is inaccurate in both geometric and numerical models. To solve this problem, this paper studied a control network and an image stitch method to assess the accuracy of a geometric model and proposed a more accurate method to obtain the geometric information of rock mass discontinuities based on digital photogrammetry. Based on discrete fracture network and discrete element method (DFN-DEM), this paper treated the rock mass discontinuities obtained by digital photogrammetry as finite disk planes and simulated the excavation process of the Qianyu tunnel. According to the simulation results, this paper determined the specific loca-tion of the collapse disaster on the tunnel face, which is of great significance to tunnel support design. Comparing the deformation of the surrounding rock mass on the tunnel face in the simulation results with the actual situation, this paper verified the feasible accuracy of this method in analysing the stability of the surrounding rock mass on a tunnel face in advance.

Further, we resolve this problem by a series of convex transformations and introduce a network penalty factor, which works as EE parameter, to convert the fractional mixed-integer form into a parametric subtractive form, and then design an effective energy-efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm to find the optimal solution.

Describing and Controlling Multivariate Nonlinear Dynamics: A Boolean Network Approach	MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH												We introduce a discrete-time dynamical system method, the Boolean network method, that may be useful for modeling, studying, and controlling nonlinear dynamics in multivariate systems, particularly when binary time-series are available. We introduce the method in three steps: inference of the temporal relations as Boolean functions, extraction of attractors and assignment of desirability based on domain knowledge, and design of network control to direct a psychological system toward a desired attractor. To demonstrate how the Boolean network can describe and prescribe control for emotion regulation dynamics, we applied this method to data from a study of how children use bidding to an adult and/or distraction to regulate their anger during a frustrating task (N = 120, T = 480 seconds). Network control strategies were designed to move the child into attractors where anger is OFF. The sample shows heterogeneous emotion regulation dynamics across children in 22 distinct Boolean networks, and heterogeneous control strategies regarding which behavior to perturb and how to perturb it. The Boolean network method provides a novel method to describe nonlinear dynamics in multivariate psychological systems and is a method with potential to eventually inform the design of interventions that can guide those systems toward desired goals.

Nature inspired discrete firefly algorithm for optimal mobile data gathering in wireless sensor networks	WIRELESS NETWORKS												Nowadays wireless sensor networks enhance the life of human beings by helping them through several applications like precision agriculture, health monitoring, landslide detection, pollution control, etc. The built-in sensors on a sensor node are used to measure the various events like temperature, vibration, gas emission, etc., in the remotely deployed unmanned environment. The limited energy constraint of the sensor node causes a huge impact on the lifetime of the deployed network. The data transmitted by each sensor node cause significant energy consumption and it has to be efficiently used to improve the lifetime of the network. The energy consumption can be reduced significantly by incorporating mobility on a sink node. Thus the mobile data gathering can result in reduced energy consumption among all sensor nodes while transmitting their data. A special mobile sink node named as the mobile data transporter (MDT) is introduced in this paper to collect the information from the sensor nodes by visiting each of them and finally it sends them to the base station. The Data collection by the MDT is formulated as a discrete optimization problem which is termed as a data gathering tour problem. To reduce the distance traveled by the MDT during its tour, a nature-inspired heuristic discrete firefly algorithm is proposed in this paper to optimally collect the data from the sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm computes an optimal order to visit the sensor nodes by the MDT to collect their data with minimal travel distance. The proposed algorithm is compared with tree-based data collection approaches and ant colony optimization approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperform other approaches minimizing the tour length under different scenarios.

The integration of power system and communication network has brought challenges into the resilience of interdependent networks. Following an outage or blackout, system operators cannot only restore one network while simply ignoring the interconnection with the other network. Effective restoration strategies that involve coordination between power system and communication network have become critical in enhancing the resilience. In this paper, an optimization-based restoration strategy is developed to coordinate the restoration actions between two networks. The problem is modelled as a mixed integer linear programming problem, with the objective of activating every node in both networks with the minimum number of activation/energization of branches. The developed strategies are tested on the modified IEEE 14-bus system incorporating communication network. Simulation results demonstrate that the coordinated restoration strategies are effective and critical in the successful recovery of interdependent networks. The developed model could also provide insights in network design and planning to enhance the resilience of interdependent power system and communication network.																			2051-3305					NOV 22	2017																								WOS:000416268600002

We use the concept of switching networks and show that almost every switching network of logarithmic depth can be used to almost randomly permute any set of (1 - epsilon)n elements with any epsilon > 0 (that is, gives an almost (1 - epsilon)n-wise independent permutation). Furthermore, we show that the result still holds for every switching network of logarithmic depth that has some special expansion properties, leading to an explicit construction of such networks. Our result can be also extended to an explicit construction of a switching network of depth O(log(2) n) and with O(n log n) switches that almost randomly permutes any set of n elements. We also discuss basic applications of these results in cryptography. Our results are obtained using a non -trivial coupling approach to study mixing times of Markov chains which allows us to reduce the problem to some random walk -like problem on expanders.																			0737-8017		978-1-4503-3536-2				2015							703	712		10.1145/2746539.2746629	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2746539.2746629													WOS:000485296600074

Especially, the unreliability of the communication links between the sensor and actuator/filter is taken into account, and the phenomenon of packet dropouts is characterized by a binary Markov chain with uncertain transition probabilities, which may reflect the reality more accurately than the existing description processes. A novel bounded real lemma (BRL), which ensures the stochastic admissibility with H8 performance for fuzzy discrete-time descriptor systems despite the uncertain Markov packet dropouts, is presented based on a fuzzy basis-dependent Lyapunov function. By resorting to the dual conditions of the obtained BRL, a solution for the designed fuzzy output tracking controller is given. A design method for the fullorder fuzzy filter is also provided.

For measurement data evaluation and for controller design also the so called inverse models are of considerable interest. In this paper a technique to perform neural network inversion is introduced. For discrete time inputs the proposed method provides good performance if the iterative inversion is fast enough compared to system variations, i.e. the iteration is convergent within the sampling period applied. The proposed method can be considered also as a simple nonlinear state observer, which reconstructs the selected inputs of the neural network from its outputs.

Of particular interest is the case that varying transmission delays and varying transmission intervals in NCSs cause the optimal function to be nonconvex and even the gradient is not easily computed. The new intelligent hybrid BFO-PSO algorithm is employed to search for the optimal controller parameters, and then to minimize the constrained object function subject to robust control specifications by using a randomized technique is developed which does not need any gradient information. For this purpose, we first extend the results in robust controller synthesis via parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, where the study of interplay between the stability and robust performance of NCSs feedback loops are investigated. Next, the hybrid BFO-PSO algorithm is introduced to minimize the robust control function with communication constraints. Finally, the proposed method is applied to some typical numerical examples. Simulation results show that the system oscillations are effectively damped by the proposed approach.																					978-1-4799-2538-4				2014							510	515																WOS:000393427700069

In particular, optimization of curved structures through the introduction of topological defects and doping of heteroatoms in the lattice is crucial to the design of carbon-based, non-noble-metal-free catalysts. A simple and practical mathematical model based on discrete geometric analysis is proposed to describe the geometric features of carbon networks and their relationships to their material properties. This model can pre-screen candidates for novel material design, and these candidates can be further examined by the density functional theory (DFT). Inspired by observations regarding the preferential doping of heteroatoms at local curved sites, the important characteristics of the candidate material were experimentally realized, and its enhanced catalytic activity facilitated by chemical dopants was confirmed in the designed carbon network.

J	Liu, L; Wang, ZS; Zhang, HG				Liu, Lei; Wang, Zhanshan; Zhang, Huaguang			Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control for MIMO Discrete-Time Systems via Reinforcement Learning Algorithm With Less Learning Parameters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												This paper is concerned with a reinforcement learning-based adaptive tracking control technique to tolerate faults for a class of unknown multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear discrete-time systems with less learning parameters. Not only abrupt faults are considered, but also incipient faults are taken into account. Based on the approximation ability of neural networks, action network and critic network are proposed to approximate the optimal signal and to generate the novel cost function, respectively. The remarkable feature of the proposed method is that it can reduce the cost in the procedure of tolerating fault and can decrease the number of learning parameters and thus reduce the computational burden. Stability analysis is given to ensure the uniform boundedness of adaptive control signals and tracking errors. Finally, three simulations are used to show the effectiveness of the present strategy. Note to Practitioners-As the practical engineering systems are becoming more and more complex, it is more likely to suffer from faults which can lead to unpredictable behaviors and serious damages. Therefore, adaptive fault tolerant control technique plays an important role in modern engineering systems. As a matter of fact, it is always desired to minimize the maintenance cost even when some faults occur in the systems, which can reduce the energy consumption in the industrial production process. One way is to integrate the adaptive reinforcement learning algorithm into the fault tolerant controller. Furthermore, a major restriction of the learning algorithm is that a large number of parameters should be tuned online, which directly increase the computational burden. In order to tackle this difficulty, by adjusting the estimated values of the network weight vectors instead of their weights, the number of adaptive learning parameters is decreased, and the computational burden is reduced dramatically.

Recently, several real-world systems have been proposed to leverage network coding in wireless networks. Although the theoretical foundations of network coding are well understood, a real-world system needs to solve a plethora of practical aspects before network coding can meet its promised potential. These practical design choices expose network coding systems to a wide range of attacks. We identify two general frameworks (inter-flow and intra-flow) that encompass several network coding-based systems proposed in wireless networks. Our systematic analysis of the components of these frameworks reveals vulnerabilities to a wide range of attacks, which may severely degrade system performance. Then, we identify security goals and design challenges in achieving security for network coding systems. Adequate understanding of both the threats and challenges is essential to effectively design secure practical network coding systems. Our paper should be viewed as a cautionary note pointing out the frailty of current network coding-based wireless systems and a general guideline in the effort of achieving security for network coding systems.

This paper adopts the Gilbert-Elliott channel model to describe the temporal correlation among packet losses, and proposes an update scheme to select the assumed available states for use in a sliding mode control law. A technique used in the theory of discrete-time Markov jump linear systems is applied to tackle the effect of the packet losses. This involves introducing a couple of Lyapunov functions dependent on the indicator functions of the instantaneous packet loss, and proving that the sliding mode controller is able to drive the system state trajectories into the neighborhood of the designed integral sliding surface in mean-square sense given that the corresponding Lyapunov inequalities are satisfied. The system is guaranteed thereafter to remain inside the neighborhood of the sliding surface. Simulated case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the control law.

Although they are built using current technological treads, they often fail to provide the desired performance. A potential cause is that, design related problems, as application modeling, resource allocation and replication, network configuration and performance evaluation, although interrelated are solved in isolation. We, thus, argue that a concise methodology for effectively designing web-based information systems offers considerable capabilities. Four discrete stages, each of them addressing a specific issue, and their dependencies are identified. We also propose a common model for the representation of system entities throughout all design stages. UML-like notation was used as a visual tool for graphical representation of model components. Since the modelling scheme is extendable, the adaptation of UML constructs simplifies the process of extending or customizing the model. A case study where the proposed methodology was used for the design a complex enterprise system and the experience obtained are also presented.

For this reason, the main efforts of researchers in this area are aimed at designing efficient algorithms that produce good heuristic solutions. The majority of the reported results propose variations and modifications of the classical algorithm for perceptron training in order to obtain the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the corresponding matrix of weights. The algorithm presented in this paper transforms the original set of training patterns into a linearly separable set. When the procedure for verifying linear separability is applied, the weights corresponding to the output layer are obtained. The end result of the proposed algorithm, a trained neural network is obtained that correctly classifies the set of patterns into K classes.

Hence, optimal design and management are important tasks to promote diffusion against the centralised grid. However, current operational models for such systems do not adequately analyse their complexity. This paper presents the results of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of distributed energy systems in the residential sector which builds up on previous work in this field. A superstructure optimisation model for design and operation of DER systems is obtained, providing a more holistic overview of such systems by including the following novel elements: a) Design and utilisation of a network with integrated heating/cooling pipelines and microgrid connections between neighbourhoods; b) Exploration of use of feed-in tariffs (FITs), renewable heat incentives (RHIs) and the ability to buy/sell from/to the national grid. It is shown that the (DER network mitigates around 30e40% of the CO2 emissions per household, compared with "traditional generation". Money from FITs, RHIs and sales to the grid, as well as reduced grid purchases, make DER networks far more economical, and even profitable, compared to the traditional energy consumption. & COPY; 2021 The Authors.

Based on a situation that the nearer to disaster area, the higher probability of time delay, prospect theory is specially introduced to reflect the subjective decision behavior of decision-maker. Then, a discrete robustness optimization model is proposed with the purpose of the better timeliness and robustness. The model is based on the emergency transportation network with multistorage centers and multidisaster points. In order to obtain the optimal solution, an improved genetic algorithm is designed by introducing a bidirectional search strategy based on a newfangled path cluster to obtain specific paths that connect each storage centers and each disaster points. Finally, a case study is exhibited to demonstrate the reasonability of the model, theory, and algorithm. The result shows that the path cluster with the better timeliness and robustness can be well obtained by using the prospect theory and improved genetic algorithm. The analysis especially reveals that the robustness is correspondent to the risk aversion in prospect theory.

First, a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model represents the discrete-time nonlinear system with time-varying delay. Second, a fuzzy observer design estimates immeasurable state. Third, a virtual desired variable (VDV) based tracking controller design guarantees H-infinity, control performance for the overall system. Using Lyapunov's stability analysis, we obtain sufficient conditions for stability of estimation, control, and robustness. The advantages are as follows: (i) allow unknown time-varying delay; (ii) ensure robust output tracking; (iii) provide relaxed conditions via a three-steps procedure to find observer and controller gain. To verify the theoretical derivation, we carry out numerical simulations on a stirred tank reactor system as an example. Satisfactory results validate the claims. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The quantized consensus problem is cast into the robust consensus problem with sector bound uncertainties associated with the edges of communication graphs, and then an edge sensitivity design approach is utilized for the filter parameter design. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the filter parameter for preserving robust consensus with sector bound uncertainties are provided, which are shown to be dependent on the H-infinity norm of the edge complementary sensitivity transfer matrix of the closed-loop multiagent system. Then, the optimal filter parameter design is provided by solving a constrained optimization problem, under which robust consensus with maximal allowable sector bound parameter is reached. The results show that the supremum of the sector bound parameter of the logarithmic quantizer for preserving robust consensus is independent of the communication network topologies and the sampling period.

The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a discontinuous controller to stabilize the states of such neural networks in finite time. Unlike the previous works, such stabilization objective will be realized for neural networks when the activations and controllers are both discontinuous. Based on the famous finite-time stability theorem of nonlinear systems and nonsmooth analysis in mathematics, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the finite-time stability of the dynamics of NNs. Then, the upper bound of the settling time for stabilization can be estimated in two forms due to two different methods of proof.

The technology creates a three-dimensional (3D) representation of fracture geometry used in the construction of surface and subsurface engineering projects in mining, civil engineering, and fracturing of the reservoir in the oil and gas industry. The approach depends on the accuracy of the data obtained during site investigation to create models that represent the fracture geometry of the structure. The better the acquired information available, the better the stochastic analysis that determines the engineering applications and designs that can be carried out. Therefore, it is important to use instruments that can capture fracture distribution characteristics such as fracture intensity, fracture orientation, spatial distribution, fracture length, fracture aperture, and size. This study provides a detailed review of the recent advances in the application of a DFN for modelling jointed rock masses in different engineering applications. The paper shows the principles of modelling in a DFN, including various data-capturing methodologies, and the general application of DFN in various fields. Several case studies where the DFN method was applied are presented in the paper. These include evaluation of slope in an open pit mine, modelling of discontinuity in tunneling, stability evaluation of coal seam longwall, the design of high-level radioactive waste, prediction of groundwater flow, fracturing of petroleum reservoirs, and geothermal cracking of shale gas in the coal bed. However, despite the versatility of the DFN technique, there are still some limitations and challenges to the integration of complexities encountered in rock masses within DFN models.

However, the multimaterial AM capabilities have far outpaced the modeling capability of design systems to model and thus design novel HLSs. To further expand the design space for the utilization of AM technology, this paper proposes a method for modeling HLS with complex geometries and smooth material transitions. The geometric modeling and material modeling problems are formulated in a rigorous and computationally effective manner. The geometric complexity of HLS is significantly reduced by a semi-analytical unit cell decomposition strategy that is applied to split HLS into material units: struts and connectors. The smooth material transitions of the connector associated with multimaterial struts are realized by interpolating the discrete material property values defined at control points using a multiquadric radial basis function network.

J	Singh, M; Singh, ML				Singh, Maninder; Singh, Maninder Lal			A novel algorithm to integrate synchronous digital hierarchy networks into Optical Transport Network using mixed line rates	OPTIK												In this era of high data transfer speeds and new age technologies, Optical Transport Network (OTN) along with its newly introduced Optical Transport Hierarchy (OTH) has provided a lease of life to legacy low rate networks. It has provided a common backbone for multiple data rates to coexist on same fiber along with the enhanced transmission reach. The cost effective Optical Transport Network design has always been a complex issue due to the presence of multiple variables like number of fibers on each link, available data rates on each fiber, the wavelength count, transmission reach at each data rate, etc. In this paper an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model has been presented to solve Routing problem for Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) over OTN over DWDM design. Optical Transport Hierarchy (OTH) has been used to integrate heterogenous SDH/SONET operating at different rates (STM-16, STM-64 and STM-256) into a single network supporting mixed line rates. These rates can coexist in a same fiber but each rate carries different cost with it. The objective function aims at finding the least cost routing solution by looking at different tradeoffs between the Capital Expenditure and the operational expenditure. Certainly different variables like the number of fibers and wavelengths, transmission reach, etc. are a factor in it. A mechanism has been put to monitor the Bit Error Rate (BER) levels as well. For evaluating the ILP model, 18 Node 38 Link European Optical Network was considered as the reference model and two ordering techniques, namely, full ILP and highest rate first (HRF) were used for deriving the results. The ILP model was designed with minimum of decision variables so in spite of big reference network it converges much faster. Under the given conditions, full ILP gave least cost network whereas HRF ordering took least time for ILP to converge. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Different from the periodically triggered communication, the measurement from the sensors is transmitted to the estimator only when the so-called "event-triggered condition" is satisfied in the event-triggered transmission scheme, thereby reducing the unnecessary network traffic between the sensors and the estimator. Attention is focused on the analysis and design of the estimator subject to the predetermined event-triggered transmission scheme such that the estimation error is bounded in mean square. Sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence of admissible estimators. The desired estimator gain matrices is derived via solving a convex problem based on Lyapunov theory combined with the stochastic analysis approach.

In this paper, an adaptive reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to solve the complex Bellman equation, which balances value iteration (VI) and policy iteration (PI). By adding a balance parameter, an adaptive RL integrates VI and PI together, which accelerates VI and avoids the need of an initial admissible control. The convergence of the adaptive RL is proved by showing that it converges to the Bellman equation. Subsequently, the adaptive RL is realized by using the neural network (NN) approximation for value function and a least-squares scheme is developed for updating NN weights. Then, the convergence of NN-based adaptive RL is proved with considering NN approximation error. To further improve its performance, an adaptive rule is developed for tuning balance parameter in adaptive RL iteration by iteration. Finally, the effectiveness of the adaptive RL is validated with simulation studies.

When a CPE is powered on, it first attempts to associate with the BS. In this paper, a discrete time Markov chain model (DTMC) is presented to show the association process of CPEs with the BS. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in which DTMC Model is analyzed and investigated for WRAN. Using this model, various parameters such as association time, expected return time to the respective backoff stage, first passage time, etc., are derived.

This paper presents a complete low-complexity processing system that performs data compression, data correction and data encryption. In this system, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) first decomposes the original image into DWT coefficients to ensure low transmitting cost, then the coefficients are encrypted using the Cauchy Reed Solomon CRS(20,16) coding scheme to ensure data security. A CRS minimal instruction set computer architecture with a DWT filtering module is proposed to perform the compression, encryption and error correction encoding in a low-complexity processing system. The proposed system is then implemented in a field programmable gated array (FPGA) to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system for implementation in WVSNs. Results on a Xilinx Spartan FPGA show that the proposed system requires a lower implementation complexity of 2536 slices as compared to other existing systems such as Crypto-Processor (4828 slices) and SPIHT CRS MISC (5017 slices).					ang, li-minn/AAG-5986-2020; Ijemaru, Gerald K/AAB-5600-2020	ang, li-minn/0000-0002-2402-7529; Ijemaru, Gerald K/0000-0001-5146-6829; Ong, Jia Jan/0000-0002-7199-1003													1743-8225	1743-8233					2019	30	2					73	90		10.1504/IJAHUC.2019.097628	http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJAHUC.2019.097628													WOS:000459619400002

First, a Markov process is introduced to model random mutation phenomena among topologies of complex dynamic networks. Then, a sampling controller is designed to address practical needs. At the same time, some sufficient conditions are provided to enable the system to meet a mixed H-infinity/passive performance index. Moreover, the article adopted a free weight matrix combined with a novel decoupling method, which removes the equality constraints, the requirement on the rank of the output matrix, and the use of some inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical framework in this paper is demonstrated through a set of numerical examples and their application in image encryption.

Furthermore, model efficiency is of vital importance in computer vision. In this paper, we present an efficient encoder-decoder network that predicts missing point clouds on the basis of incomplete point clouds. There are several advantages to this approach. First, a Mixed Attention Module (MAM) was implemented to obtain the correlational information of points.

Hybrid strategy for routing, modulation and spectrum assignment in elastic optical networks	OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS												In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation with different alternative routing approaches that is capable of solving, simultaneously, the routing, modulation format and spectrum assignment problem in the design of elastic optical networks. We extend our proposal to a path-link formulation that, although it is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, it has shown reasonable solutions within inferior simulation time, allowing it to be used in not very short networks. We also compare our proposal with another MILP formulation and three adapted heuristics, all available in the literature. The results show the benefits of our proposal considering diverse simulation scenarios and different number of modulation formats over 19 realistic networks in terms of simulation run time and maximum number of used set of slots.

J	Zile, M				Zile, Mehmet			Design and Implementation of Wind Speed/Solar Radiation Hybrid Energy Station Connected with the Network	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH												In this study, a new hybrid power plant is designed to convert solar and wind energy into electricity. Wind speed and solar radiation measurements were made in the different sections of Mersin Province. In the designed power plant, the energy obtained by tracing the direction of the sun and the wind is stored in accumulator groups. As soon as the accumulator groups are full, the generated energy is either transferred directly to the plateau houses or transferred to the network to produce a continuous energy production. This provides a continuous power flow between the power plant and the network. For this purpose, two boost converters were built to connect the electric power from the wind turbine and the solar panels. The boost converters are designed to operate parallel to each other and to keep the output power continuously at the maximum level. Both converters are controlled via a micro controller. It is demonstrated by this work how to make and select the location of high efficiency wind-solar hybrid power plant anywhere in the world. This designed and implemented power plant generated energy can be stored and energy surplus to the existing interconnection system can be transferred to obtain financial gain.																			2307-1877	2307-1885				DEC	2019	7	4					203	214																WOS:000503407000012
J	WAGNER, BJ				WAGNER, BJ			SAMPLING DESIGN METHODS FOR GROUNDWATER MODELING UNDER UNCERTAINTY	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A sampling network design model is presented that evaluates the trade-off between the varying costs of different types of data and the contribution of those data to improving model reliability. The methodology couples parameter-estimate and model-prediction uncertainty analyses with optimization to identify the mix of hydrogeologic information (e.g., head, concentration, and/or hydraulic conductivity measurement locations) that will minimize model prediction uncertainty for a given data collection budget. Two alternative optimization algorithms are presented and compared: a branch-and-bound algorithm and a genetic algorithm. A series of synthetic examples are presented to demonstrate the adaptability of the methodology to different sampling scenarios. The examples reveal two important properties of this network design problem. First, model-parameter and model-prediction uncertainty analyses are important components of the network design methodology because they provide a natural framework for evaluating the cost/information trade-off for different types of data and different sampling network designs. Second, the genetic algorithm can identify near-optimal solutions for a small fraction of the computational effort needed to determine the globally optimal solutions of the branch-and-bound algorithm.																			0043-1397					OCT	1995	31	10					2581	2591		10.1029/95WR02107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95WR02107													WOS:A1995RX71500020

J	Yan, JL; Ando, K; Yu, J; Motomura, M				Yan, Jiale; Ando, Kota; Yu, Jaehoon; Motomura, Masato			TT-MLP: Tensor Train Decomposition on Deep MLPs	IEEE ACCESS												Deep multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have achieved promising performance on computer vision tasks. Deep MLPs consist solely of fully-connected layers as the conventional MLPs do but adopt more sophisticated network architectures based on mixer layers composed of token-mixing and channel-mixing components. These architectures enable deep MLPs to have global receptive fields, but the significant increase of parameters becomes a massive burden on practical applications. To tackle this problem, we focus on using tensor-train decomposition (TTD) for compressing deep MLPs. At first, this paper analyzes deep MLPs under conventional TTD methods, especially using various designs of a macro framework and micro blocks: The former is how to concatenate mixer layers, and the latter is how to design a mixer layer. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel TTD method named Train-TTD-Train. The proposed method exerts the learning capability of channel-mixing components and improves the trade-off between accuracy and size. In the evaluation, the proposed method showed a better trade-off than conventional TTD methods on ImageNet-1K and achieved a 0.56% higher inference accuracy with a 15.44% memory reduction on Cifar-10.

The dynamical systems of multivariate time series could be modeled with complex unknown partial differential equations (PDEs) which play a prominent role in many disciplines of science and engineering. In this article, we propose a continuous-time model for arbitrary-step prediction to learn an unknown PDE system in multivariate time series whose governing equations are parameterized by self-attention and gated recurrent neural networks. The proposed model, exogenous-guided PDE network (EgPDE-Net), takes account of the relationships among the exogenous variables and their effects on the target series. Importantly, the model can be reduced into a regularized ordinary differential equation (ODE) problem with specially designed regularization guidance, which makes the PDE problem tractable to obtain numerical solutions and feasible to predict multiple future values of the target series at arbitrary time points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model could achieve competitive accuracy over strong baselines: on average, it outperforms the best baseline by reducing 9.85% on RMSE and 13.98% on MAE for arbitrary-step prediction.

In the two NILC schemes, the dropped control input of the current iteration is substituted by the synchronous input used at the previous iteration, whilst for the dropped system output, the first replacement strategy is to replace it by the synchronous pre-given desired trajectory and the second one is to substitute it by the synchronous output used at the previous iteration. By the stochastic analysis technique, we analyse the convergence properties of two NILC schemes. It is shown that under appropriate constraints on learning gain and packet dropout probabilities, the tracking errors driven by the two schemes are convergent to zero in the expectation sense along iteration direction, respectively. Finally, illustrative simulations are carried out to manifest the validity and effectiveness of the results.																			0020-7721	1464-5319					2018	49	12					2682	2694		10.1080/00207721.2018.1509244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2018.1509244													WOS:000445873000014

Neural networks for inelastic mid-span deflections in continuous composite beams	STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING AND MECHANICS												Maximum deflection in a beam is a design criteria and occurs generally at or close to the mid-span. Neural networks have been developed for the continuous composite beams to predict the inelastic mid-span deflections (typically for 20 years, considering cracking, and time effects, i.e., creep and shrinkage, in concrete) from the elastic moments and elastic mid-span deflections (neglecting instantaneous cracking and time effects). The training and testing data for the neural networks is generated using a hybrid analytical-numerical procedure of analysis. The neural networks have been validated for four example beams and the errors are shown to be small. This methodology, of using networks enables a rapid estimation of inelastic mid-span deflections and requires a computational effort almost equal to that required for the simple elastic analysis. The neural networks can be extended for the composite building frames that would result in huge saving in computational time.

The IPN gels were prepared by co-hydrating a mixed Mg and gellan powder, followed by adding GDL and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in sequence to initiate the gelation. It was found that Alg and gellan can form independently a gel network, with no significant interaction between the two types of gel networks observed, as indicated by the results of gel strength determination, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations and thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetric (DIG) analyses. Moreover, the mixing ratio of Alg to gellan significantly affected the physical properties of the fabricated gels. With increasing Alg to gellan ratio, the gels tended to become more elastic, and to show a higher rehydration rate and rehydration extent. Overall, these tunable properties may allow the fabricated gels to find potential applications in designing or optimizing the structures of gel-related food products. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	AlKheder, S				AlKheder, Sharaf			Pavement Performance Enhancement Using Waste Rubber: Green Pavement Design for Kuwait	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The massive amount of solid waste, especially used tires, is one of the most problematic environmental issues facing Kuwait recently. This has caused a rapid increase in the environmental pollution levels. Furthermore, Kuwait's road network showed a weak performance against traffic loads and climatic changes recently causing the appearance of several pavement distresses. This paper enhanced the design of type III wearing coarse layer by incorporating the tire rubber into the Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) to produce the Pelletpave product. Pelletpave contains at least 20% recycled tire crumb rubber incorporated in the mix. Marshall Mix Design Method was used to prepare all required specimens. To compare Pelletpave and conventional HMA in terms of quality and cost, two asphalt mixes were prepared. The first asphalt mix contained only conventional bitumen as a binder while the second mix contained a conventional bitumen mixed with the tires crumb rubber. A ratio of 3:2.7 pellet to bitumen was selected. Three binder contents for each binder type were selected: 4.5%, 5.4%, 5.9%. To ensure the best selection of the optimum binder content, a 4th binder content was chosen for an extra trial. The 4th binder content was determined based on the test results and the air void percentage of the three initial mixes as 4.4% for the conventional bitumen and 6.4% for the Pelletpave. Using trial-and-error for the Pelletpave mix, the optimum binder content was chosen as 6%, it showed an air void percentage value of 6.7%, a stability value of 18.63 kN that satisfied the required criteria. Pelletpave mix showed a high initial cost, but it has a lower life cycle cost than the conventional mix. So, it is a cost-effective mix.

Recently, the concept of cross-layer design in wireless networks has been investigated extensively. In this work, we present a cross-layer optimization framework, i.e., joint rate control, routing, link scheduling and power control for multi-hop time division multiple access (TDMA) networks. In particular, we study a centralized controller that coordinates the routing process and transmissions of links such that the network lifetime is maximized. We show that the aforementioned design can be formulated as a mixed integer-linear program (MILP) which has worst case exponential complexity to compute the optimal solution. Therefore, our main contribution is to propose a computationally efficient approach to solve the cross-layer design problem. Our design methodology is based on a so-called Difference of Convex functions algorithm (DCA) to provide either optimal or near-optimal solutions with finite convergence. The numerical results are encouraging and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. One of the advantages of the proposed design is the capability to handle very large-scale problems which are the usual scenarios encountered in practice.

Due to the limited communication energy or network bandwidth, an event-triggered control strategy capable of achieving the goal of reducing the resources and the communication load is adopted. Different from the existing results, by taking full advantage of positive property of output, a mode-dependent linear weighting triggering condition is given in the paper, which can deal with the positive stabilization problem efficiently. Furthermore, an asynchronously event-triggered output-feedback controller is designed to ensure the closed loop system remain positive and exponentially stable by virtue of multiple copositive type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional incorporated with linear programming method. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the results obtained.																			1598-6446	2005-4092				SEP	2021	19	9					3101	3110		10.1007/s12555-020-0655-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12555-020-0655-7		JUL 2021											WOS:000677961200008
J	Hu, ZY; Chan, CK				Hu, Zhouyi; Chan, Chun-Kit			A 7-D Hyperchaotic System-Based Encryption Scheme for Secure Fast-OFDM-PON	JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY												In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel two-step I/Q-encryption scheme for improving physical layer security in fast orthogonal frequency division multiplexing passive optical network (fast-OFDM-PON). To meet the requirement of this encryption scheme and further enhance the security, a seven-dimensional hyperchaotic system with five positive Lyapunov exponents is designed. In this system, Walsh-Hadamard transform and discrete cosine transform are chosen to reduce the computation complexity and increase the key space simultaneously. An optional discrete Fourier transform spread is required to achieve the maximum scrambling degree. Encryption of 9.4-Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation fast-OFDM signals with a total key space of similar to 10(788) against the exhaustive trial has been successfully implemented over 50-km standard single mode fiber in a fast-OFDM-PON, which shows good resistance against illegal access to optical network units. All the results indicate that this proposed encryption scheme has improved security performance with relatively low computation complexity.

In the two schemes, the delayed signal of the current control input is replaced by the synchronous input utilised at the previous iteration, whilst for the delayed signal of the system output the one scheme substitutes it by the synchronous predetermined desired trajectory and the other takes it by the synchronous output at the previous operation, respectively. In virtue of the mathematical expectation, the tracking performance is analysed which exhibits that for both the linear time-invariant and nonlinear affine systems the two kinds of NILCs are convergent under the assumptions that the probabilities of communication delays are adequately constrained and the product of the input-output coupling matrices is full-column rank. Last, two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed NILC schemes.																			0020-7721	1464-5319					2017	48	9					1844	1855		10.1080/00207721.2017.1289567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2017.1289567													WOS:000401712300007

In a metallogel, a metal is a part of the gel network as a coordinated metal ion (in a discrete coordination complex), as a cross-linking metal node with a multitopic ligand (in coordination polymer), and as metal nanoparticles adhered to the gel network. Although the field is relatively new, research into metallogels has experienced a considerable upsurge owing to its fundamental importance in supramolecular chemistry and various potential applications. This focus review aims to provide an insight into the development of designing metallogelators. Because of the limited scope, discussions are confined to examples pertaining to metallogelators derived from discrete coordination complexes, organometallic gelators, and coordination polymers. This review is expected to enlighten readers on the current development of designing metallogelators of the abovementioned class of molecules.

And, the typical model is transformed into an affine nonlinear DT system, the constraint of the coupling robot input torque is extended to pseudo dead zone (PDZ) control input. Three neural networks (NNs) are introduced as action NNs to approximate the unknown modeling item, the skidding and the slipping item and the PDZ item, whereas another NN is employed as critic NN to approximate the strategy utility function. Then, the critic and action NN adaptive laws are designed through the standard gradient-based adaptation method. The uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of all signals in the affine nonlinear DT WMR system can be ensured, while the tracking error converging to a small compact set by zero. Numerical simulations are conduced to validate the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, XH; Ma, MD				Huang, XH; Ma, MD			An efficient scheduling algorithm for real-time traffic on WDM passive star optical networks	JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY												One of the major challenges in the design of future-generation high-speed networks is the provision of quality-of-service (QoS) to real-time traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling scheme, namely differentiated dropping scheduling (DDS), which is designed to handle real-time traffic in passive star-coupled wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. By taking channel and destination availability into account, DDS can dramatically improve network performance in terms of message loss rate. Moreover, this scheme has the capacity of preventing channel collision and destination conflict. In order to evaluate the proposed DDS algorithm, extensive discrete-event simulations and mathematical performance comparison are conducted by comparing its performance with Moore and Hodgson's algorithm and the earliest-due-date (EDD) algorithm. The results show that DDS can achieve the best performance among the three algorithms.

J	Shekatkar, SM; Ambika, G				Shekatkar, Snehal M.; Ambika, G.			Novel coupling scheme to control dynamics of coupled discrete systems	COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION												We present a new coupling scheme to control spatio-temporal patterns and chimeras on 1-d and 2-d lattices and random networks of discrete dynamical systems. The scheme involves coupling with an external lattice or network of damped systems. When the system network and external network are set in a feedback loop, the system network can be controlled to a homogeneous steady state or synchronized periodic state with suppression of the chaotic dynamics of the individual units. The control scheme has the advantage that its design does not require any prior information about the system dynamics or its parameters and works effectively for a range of parameters of the control network. We analyze the stability of the controlled steady state or amplitude death state of lattices using the theory of circulant matrices and Routh-Hurwitz criterion for discrete systems and this helps to isolate regions of effective control in the relevant parameter planes. The conditions thus obtained are found to agree well with those obtained from direct numerical simulations in the specific context of lattices with logistic map and Henon map as on-site system dynamics. We show how chimera states developed in an experimentally realizable 2-d lattice can be controlled using this scheme. We propose this mechanism can provide a phenomenological model for the control of spatio-temporal patterns in coupled neurons due to non-synaptic coupling with the extra cellular medium. We extend the control scheme to regulate dynamics on random networks and adapt the master stability function method to analyze the stability of the controlled state for various topologies and coupling strengths.

Based on the neighboring vehicle information, a novel cooperative look-ahead predictor-like control protocols are firstly designed for the CAVS to deal with time delay. Secondly, different from the existing literature that only the sufficient condition is obtained, the necessary and sufficient conditions in sense of the mean-square consensus are derived in this paper. The obtained results not only reveal an explicit relation among the system matrices, noise variance and time delay via an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE), but also amount the optimal control design problem to solving an eigenvalue problem (EVP). Furthermore, considering time delay and perturbations simultaneously, the necessary and sufficient conditions of string stability are further derived. Such conditions only depend on the controller parameters and the network weight. Finally, the validity of derived results is verified by some simulations.

This lower bound is tight if p is no larger than 4. We construct a family of such networks with radius of direct attraction Omega(n/root plog p), for any p greater than or equal to 5. The techniques used to prove the result led us to the first polynomial-time algorithm for designing a neural network with maximum radius of direct attraction around arbitrary input patterns. The optimal synaptic matrix is computed using the ellipsoid method of linear programming in conjunction with an efficient separation oracle. Restrictions of symmetry and non-negative diagonal entries in the synaptic matrix can be accommodated within this scheme.																					0-7923-9844-0				1997							97	121																WOS:A1997BH88U00003

In this paper, an overlapping community detection algorithm based on biogeography optimization is proposed. Firstly, the algorithm takes the method of label propagation based on local max degree and neighborhood overlap for initial network partitioning. The preliminary partition result used to construct initial population by cloning and mutating to accelerate the algorithm's convergence. Next, to make biogeography optimization algorithm suitable for community detection, we design problem-specific migration rules and mutation operators based on a novel affinity degree to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm. Experiments on benchmark test data, including two synthetic networks and four real-world networks, show that the proposed algorithm can achieve results with better accuracy and stability than the compared evolutionary algorithms.

J	Liu, J; Liu, FY; Wang, LB				Liu, Jian; Liu, Fangyu; Wang, Linbing			Acceleration of Superpave Mix Design: Solving Multi-Objective Optimization Problems Using Machine Learning and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												The traditional asphalt mix design requires the preparation of many samples to test, which consumes much time and labor. Moreover, selecting aggregate gradation and asphalt content based on individual experience until a mixture's properties meet a specification is a trial-and-error procedure. To accelerate the current design process and broaden the search range of the design space, this study proposed a fast and cost-saving Superpave volumetric mix design framework to automatically determine the asphalt mix proportion using the prediction ability of machine learning (ML) and Pareto optimal solutions of multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems generated by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II. Two goals were pursued in the MOO problems, namely material cost and whether the air void (AV) is close to 4%. To transform the Superpave volumetric mix design process into MOO problems, maximum theoretical specific gravity (Gmm) and AV prediction models were developed. To do so, a comprehensive traditional hot mix asphalt design dataset was collected from the literature. With the inputs of binder performance grading, asphalt content, aggregate gradation and density, and compaction work, seven ML models were trained based on the dataset. The results show that gradient boosting and extreme gradient boosting performed the best at predicting the Gmm and AV, with coefficients of determination of 0.93 and 0.86, respectively. The proposed design process was implemented in an actual project and quickly yielded the optimum designs for designing 12.5- and 19-mm nominal maximum aggregate size mixtures. Furthermore, the volumetric properties of these designs closely matched the laboratory-measured values.																			0361-1981	2169-4052				2024 MAY 31	2024										10.1177/03611981241246782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03611981241246782		MAY 2024											WOS:001236458900001

To clearly describe the network capabilities between the CPSs within network-centric warfare (NCW), we first modeled communication factors separately from the overall CPSs. The CPS models and the network model were considered discrete event systems, which were realized with DEVSim++ and ns-3, respectively. For the simulation of the two types of models, we interoperated them with high-level architecture-based middleware to preserve the independence of each one. The goal for NCW analysis is to find a balance between the computational, physical, and communication factors of the defense CPSs to achieve their missions within a networked environment. In the case study of network-centric ground warfare, the CPS models generate mission effectiveness to be analyzed according to realistic network conditions; and at the same time, the network model enables the analysis of the network performance given validated combat scenarios. We expect this paper will help simulation experts interactively analyze computational and physical capabilities of the CPSs as well as communication effects between the CPSs.					; Seo, Kyung-Min/Y-8639-2018	Kang, Bonggu/0000-0002-7522-4979; Seo, Kyung-Min/0000-0003-1017-1674													2169-3536						2019	7						42063	42080		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907566													WOS:000465136300001

Users issue queries to sensors and collect sensing data Due to the low quality sensing devices or random link failures, sensor data are often noisy. In order to increase the reliability of the query results, continuous queries are often employed. In this work we focus on continuous holistic queries like Median. Existing approaches are mainly designed for non-holistic queries like Average. However, it is not trivial to answer holistic ones due to their non-decomposable property. We propose two schemes for answering queries under different data changing conditions. While sensor data changes slowly, based on the data correlation between different rounds, we propose one algorithm for getting the exact answers. When the data changing speed is high, we propose another approach to derive the approximate results. We evaluate both designs through extensive simulations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the traffic cost compared with previous works while maintaining the same accuracy.

The considered nonlinear networked system is described by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The event-triggered policy and the dynamic quantizer will be considered to realize the effective use of the restricted network bandwidth resources. Moreover, a stochastic variable that satisfies the Bernoulli random binary distribution is employed to characterize the effects of stochastic cyber attacks. This paper focus on the design of full-and reduced-order event-triggered H-infinity filters and the dynamic parameter of the quantizer such that the filtering error system is stochastically stable and satisfies a predefined H-infinity filtering performance.

C	Pisano, C		Morello, E; Piga, BEA		Pisano, Carlo			Coloring the patchwork metropolis	ENVISIONING ARCHITECTURE: DESIGN, EVALUATION, COMMUNICATION					11th European Architectural Envisioning Association Conference on Envisioning Architecture: Design, Evaluation, Communication	SEP 25-28, 2013	Politecnico Milano, Milan, ITALY		Politecnico Milano			The contemporary discussion about the city is characterized by the fear of the phenomenon of dispersion. Huge efforts are spent to maintain the city compact and manageable by setting always new boundaries between what was the ancient city and the contemporary territory. What in reality has been achieved, through this theoretical blindness, is just a continuous growth of the diffuse city. Job and population density data clearly show that the Netherlands cannot be represented anymore as a series of medium size cities located in an open landscape. Perhaps there was a period when red and green on topographical maps could be interpreted as each other opposite, but today the Randstad cannot be simplified with this opposition, too many exceptions, in fact, are appearing in the territory in between and too many important elements would be cut out. If this is true, which model or structure can we use to represent what is happening in the contemporary Dutch territory? The methodology used for this study consists in the identification of the main features of the Dutch territory and their re-construction through a series of graphical representations that relate inhabitant density to land use and morphology. This new territorial representation highlights some phenomena that are usually hidden under the dichotomy urban and rural, like many dense and mixed use areas normally tagged as Green Hearth. A complete territory has been shaped by the interactions between social and economical processes. Instead of struggling in search of new centralities, we could recognize a modem network structure and the emergence of a new model through which we should understand and design the contemporary territory.

Generally, a continuous sign language recognition system consists of visual input encoder for feature extraction and a sequence learning model to learn the correspondence between the input sequence and the output sentence-level labels. We use a 3D residual convolutional network (3D-ResNet) to extract visual features. After that, a stacked dilated convolutional network with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is applied for learning the mapping between the sequential features and the text sentence. The deep network is hard to train since the CTC loss has limited contribution to early CNN parameters. To alleviate this problem, we design an iterative optimization strategy to train our architecture. We generate pseudo-labels for video clips from sequence learning model with CTC, and fine-tune the 3D-ResNet with the supervision of pseudolabels for a better feature representation. We alternately optimize feature extractor and sequence learning model with iterative steps. Experimental results on RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather, a large real-world continuous sign language recognition benchmark, demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of our proposed method.

However, purely hardware realizations tend to focus on throughput, resorting to restrictions on applicable network topology or low-precision data representation, whereas flexible solutions allowing a wide variation of network parameters and training algorithms are usually restricted to software implementations. This paper proposes a mixed approach, introducing a system-on-chip (SoC) implementation where computations are carried out by a high efficiency neural coprocessor with a large number of parallel processing elements. System flexibility is provided by on-chip software control and the use of floating-point arithmetic, and network parallelism is exploited through replicated logic and application-specific coprocessor architecture, leading to fast training time. Performance results and design limitations and trade-offs are discussed.

Sparsity Enhanced Mismatch Model for Robust Intercell Interference Management in Heterogeneous Networks With Doubly-Selective Fading Channels	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS												Transmission over doubly-selective fading (DSF) interference channel often relies on the use of robust precoder due to a lack of accurate channel state information, with performance often depending on the conservativeness of the mismatch model. Previously proposed mismatch models either have been deemed too conservative (deterministic models) or are prone to error due to inaccuracy in the probability density function (pdf) and corresponding parameters (stochastic models). A deterministic mismatch model called Sparsity Enhanced Mismatch Model-Reverse discrete prolate spheroidal sequence, or SEMMR, is proposed herein in an attempt to alleviate this problem. Different from all previously deterministic models, the proposed model exploits the inherent sparse characteristics of DSF interference channels which lead to a two-stage robust transceiver design that outperforms precoding only strategy incorporating conventional norm ball mismatch model (NBMM). The inherent sparsity in the channel is brought forth by modeling the channel using a basis expansion model (BEM) where discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS) is used as a basis. Analytical and simulation results are provided to validate the performance gains of the SEMMR transceiver over the NBMM precoder.

However, its performance is still poor, indicated by high cost of logistics. Designing maritime logistics network is crucial for shipping company on developing their business. The objective of this research is to design a liner shipping logistics network on multi-period planning horizon using mixed integer programming with maximizing profit as objective function. Three given scenarios (fixed route and fleet size, fixed route but fleet size may increase, and random route and fleet size) are analyzed for ten years within three different conditions of demand (demand equals to forecasted demand, demand equals to forecasted demand of certain period, and demand is constant). The result shows that the second scenario gives the most satisfying result of objective function in profit and fleet allocation variables. The third scenario gives the highest profit on every condition and first scenario has the lowest number of vessels. The profit margin between the third and second scenario on each condition are 2.99%, 1.32%, and 0.004 % and fleet allocation gap between the first and second scenario are 1 ship, 1 ship, 0 ship respectively.

In this paper, a CLSC network is investigated which includes multiple plants, collection centres, demand markets, and products. To this aim, a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed that minimizes the total cost. Besides, two test problems are examined.

In this class of systems, when the system mode changes, the filter designed for the specific subsystem also switches accordingly. The main contribution is on the use of the information of the sojourn probability-the probability of the switched system staying in each subsystem-to build new kind of switched system model when this additional information is available. Sojourn probabilities are easier to obtain than the transition probabilities commonly used in Markovian jump systems. Applying the Lyapunov functional method, the bounded real lemma (BRL) for the resulting filtering error system is obtained in Theorem 1. The filter parameters are designed in Theorem 2 by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed approach.

J	Schmitz, S; Adams, R; Walsh, C				Schmitz, Susanne; Adams, Roisin; Walsh, Cathal			Incorporating data from various trial designs into a mixed treatment comparison model	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE												Estimates of relative efficacy between alternative treatments are crucial for decision making in health care. Bayesian mixed treatment comparison models provide a powerful methodology to obtain such estimates when head-to-head evidence is not available or insufficient. In recent years, this methodology has become widely accepted and applied in economic modelling of healthcare interventions. Most evaluations only consider evidence from randomized controlled trials, while information from other trial designs is ignored. In this paper, we propose three alternative methods of combining data from different trial designs in a mixed treatment comparison model. Naive pooling is the simplest approach and does not differentiate between-trial designs. Utilizing observational data as prior information allows adjusting for bias due to trial design. The most flexible technique is a three-level hierarchical model. Such a model allows for bias adjustment while also accounting for heterogeneity between-trial designs. These techniques are illustrated using an application in rheumatoid arthritis. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

An algae processing network superstructure including 7800 processing routes is proposed. Based on the superstructure, a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed to simultaneously optimize the unit cost and the unit global warming potential (GWP). To efficiently solve the nonconvex MINLP model with separable concave terms and mixed-integer fractional terms in the objective functions, a global optimization strategy that integrates a branch-and-refine algorithm based on successive piecewise linear approximations is proposed and an exact parametric algorithm based on Newton's method. Two Pareto-optimal curves are obtained for biofuel production and biological carbon sequestration, respectively. The unit annual biofuel production cost ranges from $7.02/gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) to $9.71/GGE, corresponding to unit GWP's of 26.491 to 16.52 kg CO2-eq/GGE, respectively.

Software-defined networking (SDN) and network coding (NC) are the two key apprehensions in networking that have caught much attention from both industry and academia in recent years. Decoupling of control plane and data plane in SDN enables the centralized control of the network, providing flexibility to a great extent. On the other hand, NC has shown immense potential for improving robustness and security when deployed on VANET. This article advocates for the design of an architecture which exercises the SDN concept by incorporating NC with multigeneration-mixing (MGM) functionalities to increase reliability as well as security of data transmission in vehicular networks. We design an MGM-based NC protocol for encoding and decoding of data. Moreover, a centralized SDN controller takes charge of authentication of vehicles. Finally, we build a simulation model based on realistic traffic and communication characteristics. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol leveraged by the SDN framework outperforms the conventional NC-based protocol in case of security and reliability. Moreover, the simulation model is exhibited and point-by-point execution assessment is given to demonstrate the scalability and prevalence of the proposed strategy.

Results: Of the 512 interviewees, 90% of the boys and 80% of the girls were sexually active with many partners and exhibited age-assortative mixing. Prevalences of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HSV-2 were high, but syphilis, Hepatitis C and HIV were virtually absent. The prevalence faced by subgroups differed from overall prevalence. Conclusions: The presence of bacterial STDs and the absence of HIV, HCV, and syphilis may be the result of no IDU and assortative age mixing.

J	Yi, G; Lee, ES				Yi, Gyeongbeom; Lee, Euy-Soo			Optimal Design of Generalized Process-storage Network Applicable To Polymer Processes	KOREAN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH												The periodic square wave (PSW) model was successfully applied to the optimal design of a batch-storage network. The network structure can cover any type of batch production, distribution and inventory system, including recycle streams. Here we extend the coverage of the PSW model to multitasking semi-continuous processes as well as pure continuous and batch processes. In previous solutions obtained using the PSW model, the feedstock composition and product yield were treated as known constants. This constraint is relaxed in the present work, which treats the feedstock composition and product yield as free variables to be optimized. This modification makes it possible to deal with the pooling problem commonly encountered in oil refinery processes. Despite the greater complexity that arises when the feedstock composition and product yield are free variables, the PSW model still gives analytic lot sizing equations. The ability of the proposed method to determine the optimal plant design is demonstrated through the example of a high density polyethylene (HDPE) plant. Based on the analytical optimality results, we propose a practical process optimality measure that can be used for any kind of process. This measure facilitates direct comparison of the performance of multiple processes, and hence is a useful tool for diagnosing the status of process systems. The result that the cost of a process is proportional to the square root of average flow rate is similar to the well-known six-tenths factor rule in plant design.																			0304-128X	2233-9558				JUN	2007	45	3					249	257																WOS:000436725500007

The traditional method of classifying surface defects of hot-rolled steel strips has the problems of low recognition accuracy and low efficiency in the industrial complex production environment. Design/methodology/approachThe authors selected min-max scaling comparison method to filter the training results of multiple network models on the steel strip surface defect data set. Then, the best comprehensive performance model EfficientNet-B0 was refined. Based on this, the authors proposed two mixed attention addition methods, which include squeeze-excitation spatial mixed module and multilayer mixed attention mechanism (MMAM) module, respectively. FindingsWith these two methods, the authors achieved 96.72% and 97.70% recognition accuracy on the steel strip data set after data augmentation for adapting to the complex production environment, respectively. Using the transfer learning method, the EfficientNet-B0 based on MMAM obtained 100% recognition accuracy. Originality/valueThis study not only focuses on improving the recognition accuracy of the network model itself but also considers other performance indicators of the network, which are rarely considered by many researchers. The authors further improve the intelligent production technique and address this issue. Both methods proposed in this paper can be applied to embedded equipment, which can effectively improve steel strip factory production efficiency and reduce material and time loss.																			2754-6969	2754-6977				AUG 21	2023	43	4					455	467		10.1108/RIA-01-2023-0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/RIA-01-2023-0001		JUL 2023											WOS:001032083400001

Equivalental models for simple network with weighted correlation coefficients, for network with adapted weighing and double weighing are suggested. It is shown, that the network model with double weighing (adapted and correlation coefficients) being most generalized can also conduct the recalculation process of networks to two-step algorithms without calculation of connections matrix.

MINLP Model for the Synthesis of Heat Exchanger Networks with Handling Pressure of Process Streams	24TH EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS ENGINEERING, PTS A AND B	Computer Aided Chemical Engineering				24th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE)	JUN 15-18, 2014	Budapest, HUNGARY					This paper introduces a new mathematical model for the simultaneous synthesis of heat exchanger networks (HENs), wherein the handling pressure of process streams is used to enhance the heat integration. The proposed approach combines generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation, in order to minimize the total annualized cost composed by operational and capital expenses. A multi-stage superstructure is developed for the HEN synthesis, assuming constant heat capacity flow rates and isothermal mixing, and allowing for streams splits. In this model, the pressure and temperature of streams must be treated as optimization variables, increasing further the complexity and difficulty to solve the problem. In addition, the model allows for coupling of compressors and turbines to save energy. A case study is performed to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. In this example, the optimal integration between the heat and work decreases the need for thermal utilities in the HEN design. As a result, the total annualized cost is also reduced due to the decrease in the operational expenses related to the heating and cooling of the streams.

J	Cho, Y; Gibson, RL; Lee, J; Shin, C				Cho, Yongchae; Gibson, Richard L., Jr.; Lee, Jaejoon; Shin, Changsoo			Linear-slip discrete fracture network model and multiscale seismic wave simulation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												We propose a method to design a discrete fracture network (DFN) model for seismic wave simulations that eliminates complex meshing requirements and poor mesh design. An ant-tracking volume is generated from the original seismic to capture the global fracture geometry. A mesh structure is specified prior to adding fractures. Fractures are then specified on the mesh in the form of small fracture patches following the trend of anttracking signals in the previously defined mesh. In the proposed method, the implementation of the DFN model is thus independent of the mesh structure. Also, fracture clusters in the final DFN model are composed of multiple small patches, and each small patch is represented by the linear slip model in the form of a discontinuity of the displacement field. We also performed wave simulations to validate the proposed method of DFN model building, and investigated the wave behavior in the given fracture structure. For efficient implementation of wave modeling, we employed the generalized multiscale finite element method to discretize the elastic wave equation with explicit fractures. The wave simulation results show that a small fracture segment could be ignored when the wavelength is long enough; however, fracture clusters can induce large displacement discontinuities and wave scattering, and these effects become obvious as we apply high source frequency.

No comprehensive sensor network design approach has been addressed yet in the literature to simultaneously incorporate cost, precision and reliability requirements for nonlinear plants. The presented approach attempts to accomplish this objective via enhancement of the estimation accuracy of the aimed instrumentation sensor network subject to desired cost, reliability and redundancy constraints. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)-based data reconciliation algorithm has been developed to present evaluating measures through comparisions of the estimated and real variables in terms of Modified Root Mean Squared of Error (MRMSE), while CPSO maintains the provisions of the Network Fault Tolerence (NFT) including sensor netowrk reilability (R), strong and weak redundancy degrees (i.e., SRD and WRD). The developed CPSO engine searches in a diverse variety of possible sensor networks to adopt the most fitted one based on the imposed NFT and cost design constraints. The effective capabilities of the proposed design methodology has been illustrated in a simulated nonlinear Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) as a complex process plant benchmark.

The mathematical description of the random DoS attacks and time delays in controller-to-actuator (C-A) and sensor-to-controller (S-C) communication channels is researched based on Markov stochastic theory. Considering the random characteristics of network-induced attacks and delays, the closed-loop NCS is modeled as a discrete-time linear system with Markov DoS attack and time delay. The stochastic stability criterion of a class of networked predictive control systems with random attack and delay is proposed based on Lyapunov stability theory and the predictive compensation control method. The networked model predictive output feedback controller is designed by applying the parameter compensation method and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique.

Network monitoring: Present and future	COMPUTER NETWORKS												Network monitoring guides network operators in understanding the current behavior of a network. Therefore, accurate and efficient monitoring is vital to ensure that the network operates according to the intended behavior and then to troubleshoot any deviations. However, the current practice of network-monitoring largely depends on manual operations, and thus enterprises spend a significant portion of their budgets on the workforce that monitor their networks. We analyze present network-monitoring technologies, identify open problems, and suggest future directions. In particular, our findings are based on two different analyses. The first analysis assesses how well present technologies integrate with the entire cycle of network-management operations: design, deployment, and monitoring. Network operators first design network configurations, given a set of requirements, then they deploy the new design, and finally they verify it by continuously monitoring the network's behavior. One of our observations is that the efficiency of this cycle can be greatly improved by automated deployment of pre-designed configurations, in response to changes in monitored network behavior. Our second analysis focuses on network-monitoring technologies and group issues in these technologies into five categories. Such grouping leads to the identification of major problem groups in network monitoring, e.g., efficient management of increasing amounts of measurements for storage, analysis, and presentation. We argue that continuous effort is needed in improving network-monitoring since the presented problems will become even more serious in the future, as networks grow in size and carry more data.

Models that predict shotcrete design parameters (e.g. compressive strength, slump etc) from any mixing proportions of admixtures could save considerable experimentation time consumed during trial and error based procedures. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been widely used for similar purposes; however, such models have been rarely applied on shotcrete design. In this study 19 samples of shotcrete test panels with varying quantities of water, steel fibers and silica fume were used to determine their slump, cost and compressive strength at different ages. A number of 3-layer Back propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models of different network architectures were used to train the network using 15 samples, while 4 samples were randomly chosen to validate the model. The predicted compressive strength from linear regression lacked accuracy with R-2 value of 0.36. Whereas, outputs from 3-5-3 ANN architecture gave higher correlations of R-2 = 0.99, 0.95 and 0.98 for compressive strength, cost and slump parameters of the training data and corresponding R-2 values of 0.99, 0.99 and 0.90 for the validation dataset. Sensitivity analysis of output variables using ANN can unfold the nonlinear cause and effect relationship for otherwise obscure ANN model.

From works of literature, 515 mixed design are collected and utilized for training, validation, and testing data to prepare models. Different applications of SCC require different strengths of concrete. Based on control mix compressive strength, the mix designs are grouped into three families as low, medium, and high strength, apart from a common family. The correlation between input and output variables for three different families is analyzed. ANOVA analyses are done for input parameters. Coefficient of relation (R2) is used for sensitive assessment and results for family I (R2 = 0.9299), family II (R2 = 0.824), family III (R2 = 0.8775), and family IV (R2 = 0.7991).

Optimal placement of data concentrators for expansion of the smart grid communications network	IET SMART GRID												Evolving power systems with increasing renewables penetration, along with the development of the smart grid, calls for improved communication networks to support these distributed generation sources. Automatic and optimal placement of communication resources within the advanced metering infrastructure is critical to provide a high-performing, reliable, and resilient power system. Three network design formulations based on mixed-integer linear and non-linear programming approaches are proposed to minimise network congestion by optimising residual buffer capacity through the placement of data concentrators and network routeing. Results on a case study show that the proposed models improve network connectivity and robustness, and increase average residual buffer capacity. Maximising average residual capacity alone, however, results in both oversaturated and underutilised nodes, while maximising either minimum residual capacity or total reciprocal residual capacity can yield much-improved network load allocation. Consideration of connection redundancy improves network reliability further by ensuring quality-of-service in the event of an outage. Analysis of multi-period network expansion shows that the models do not deviate significantly from optimal when used progressively (within 5% deviation), and are effective for utility planners to use for smart grid expansion.																				2515-2947				DEC	2019	2	4					537	548		10.1049/iet-stg.2019.0006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-stg.2019.0006													WOS:000591262800006

The uncertain system matrices are assumed to lie in a convex polytope. The network-induced delays are time varying but within a given interval. The random data missing is characterized by the Bernoulli random binary distribution. Delay-dependent conditions for the exponential mean-square stability are first established in terms of matrix inequalities. Then, for the robust stabilization problem, the design of an SOF controller is presented by solving bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). In order to efficiently solve a nonconvex BMI, we propose an approach based on the linear matrix inequality technique. Furthermore, the developed approach is employed to design the remote proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for NCSs. The design of a digital PID controller is formulated as a synthesis problem of the SOF control via an augmentation method.

The GMM make a fuzzy procedure to do a soft discretization of continuous variables, when dealing with continuous inputs with fuzzy and uncertain nature. Based on the FBN, the fuzzy reasoning model for prediction and diagnosis can be designed. To validate the method, an intelligent model is built and used to classify the astrocytoma malignant degree. Experiment results show that the model achieves an accuracy of 83.33%. It outperforms the Bayesian network-based model using k-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNN) to make a crisp discretization. This study provides a novel objective method to quantitatively assess the astrocytoma malignant level that can be used to assist doctors to diagnose the tumor.																					978-1-4244-0022-5				2006							175	179																WOS:000245213800031

These methods permit the design of stable networks where the elements of the interconnection matrix and nonlinear activation functions of separate neurons vary with time. For stabilization with a variable interconnection matrix it is suggested that a new second layer of neurons be introduced to the initial single-layer network and some additional connections be added between the new and old layers. This approach gives us a system with a unique equilibrium point that is globally asymptotically stable, i.e. the entire space serves as the domain of attraction of this point, and the stability does not depend on the interconnection matrix of the system. In the case of the variable activation functions, some results from a recent investigation of the absolute stability problem for neural networks are presented, along with some recommendations.																			0196-9722						2002	33	4					325	340		10.1080/01969720290040623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01969720290040623													WOS:000176145600003

To address the multisource disturbances, we put forward a novel discrete-time hybrid observer, which can deal with both modeled and unmodeled disturbances. In virtue of the radial basis function neural networks, the unknown nonlinearities are approximated. In addition, the anti-windup technique is adopted to cope with the actuator saturation phenomenon, which is pervasive in engineering practice. Bearing all the adopted mechanisms in mind, the composite control strategy is designed in a backstepping manner. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the states of the system ultimately converge to a small range with linear matrix inequalities.

Unlike the previous works, the results of FTS and FTPS are constructed for the chaotic INNs by means of direct approach instead of reduced-order way, which are more intuitive and concise. Furthermore, by designing effective Lyapunov functionals and novel feedback controllers, we obtain sufficient condition to respectively ensure FTS and FTPS of the delayed chaotic INNs, which settling times of FTS and FTPS do not depend on any initial values of the investigated systems. Until now, very few works are reported on FTS and FTPS for the delayed chaotic INNs via non-reduced-order way.

J	Liang, XB; Si, J				Liang, XB; Si, J			Global exponential stability of neural networks with globally Lipschitz continuous activations and its application to linear variational inequality problem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS												This paper investigates the existence, uniqueness, and global exponential stability (GES) of the equilibrium point for a large class of neural networks with globally Lipschitz continuous activations including the widely used sigmoidal activations and the piecewise linear activations. The provided sufficient condition for GES is mild and some conditions easily examined in practice are also presented. The GES of neural networks in the case of locally Lipschitz continuous activations is also obtained under an appropriate condition. The analysis results given in the paper extend substantially the existing relevant stability results in the literature, and therefore expand significantly the application range of neural networks in solving optimization problems, As a demonstration, we apply the obtained analysis results to the design of a recurrent neural network (RNN) for solving the linear variational inequality problem (VIP) defined on any nonempty and closed box set, which includes the box constrained quadratic programming and the linear complementarity problem as the special cases. It can be inferred that the linear VIP has a unique solution for the class of Lyapunov diagonally stable matrices, and that the synthesized RNN is globally exponentially convergent to the unique solution. Some illustrative simulation examples are also given.

This paper introduces a population-based approach inspired by a form of cultural learning - imitation. Imitation is typically defined as learning through the copying of others. In particular, it is used in this paper to design simple circuits using a discrete dynamical system representation - Turing's unorganised machines. Initial results suggest the imitation computation approach presented is competitive with evolutionary computation, i.e., another class of stochastic population-based search, to design circuits from such recurrent NAND gate networks. Synchronous and asynchronous circuits are considered.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-642-15322-8				2010	6274						360	371																WOS:000286407000031

Designing an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) model is imperative. However, when creating IDS models with distributed data collected by UAVs, it is necessary to take precautions to protect the data's security and privacy. Furthermore, most of the IDS models are focused on one-time learning but not on continuous learning. To this end, we propose a federated continuous learning framework with a stacked broad learning system (FCL-SBLS) based on the digital twin network (DTN), which can learn and train the IDS model on new data quickly and continuously. In order to improve the efficiency and quality of the IDS model when training and aggregation, we employ an asynchronous federated learning (FL) architecture, and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based UAV selection scheme assisted by DTN is proposed to help the global IDS model aggregation. The presented algorithm is validated using the CIC-IDS2017 data set, and the simulation results reveal that our algorithm achieves higher efficiency and accuracy than the existing FL scheme.

The problem is modeled as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Then, a sensitivity analysis is carried out in order to investigate the impact of variations of the customer return rates, revenues, costs as well as the proportions of returns assigned to each recovery option, on the network structure and profit. A stochastic version of the model is also developed to account for the high uncertainties faced by companies. The computational results show that the solution of the stochastic problem is stable and that the benefit from using stochastic modeling increases when the penalty over non collected returns increases.

This paper considers weight reduction technology selection and network design problem in a real-world corporation in China which produces, sells and recycles polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for soft drinks. The problem is addressed while taking consideration of future regulations of carbon emissions restrictions. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to analyze the influence of economic cost and carbon emissions for different selections in terms of the weight of PET bottle, raw material purchasing, vehicle routing, facility location, manufacturing and recycling plans, etc. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is used to deal with the uncertainty in supply chain network resulting from the weight reduction. Finally, results show that though weight reduction is both cost-effective and environmentally beneficial, the increased cost due to the switching of the filling procedure from hot-filling to aseptic cold-filling and the incumbent uncertainties have impacts on the location of the Pareto frontier. Besides, we observe that the feasible range between economic cost and carbon emission shrinks with weightreduction; and the threshold of restricted volume of carbon emission decreases with the increase of uncertainty in the supply chain network.

However, developing models that are highly accurate and reflective of real-world processes is challenging. We propose a feedforward neural network model specifically designed for continuous Multistage Manufacturing Processes (MMPs) without intermediate outputs. This model, which is termed "MMP Net," can accurately represent the control mechanism of continuous MMPs. Whereas existing studies on learning MMPs assume an intermediate output data, the MMP Net does not require such an unrealistic assumption. We use the MMP Net to develop prediction models for the lubricant base oil production process of a world-leading lubricant manufacturer. Evaluation results show that the MMP Net is superior to other deep neural network and machine learning models. Consequently, the MMP Net was actually implemented in a real factory in 2022 and is expected to save 900,000 dollars per year for each production line. We believe that our work can serve as a basis to develop customized machine learning solutions for improving continuous MMPs.

The formulations are important because there are algorithms that find the optimal solution to these problems. However, MILP problems are NP-hard, which makes the solution of design problem instances of non trivial size numerically intractable. In this article we propose a method to tackle the inherent complexity of a WDM network design problem formulated as a multicommodity flow problem. The method allows to solve WDM network design problems of medium size. We first decompose the design problem into two subproblems that can be solved separately. Multicommodity flow models are used to formulate each subproblem as a MILP problem. We then prune the variables' space associated to each subproblem by eliminating from the formulation useless variables. The solution to the design problem is obtained by solving the subproblems sequentially. To take into account the dependency between subproblems, we introduce a feedback mechanism to exchange information between the algorithms that solve the subproblems.																					0-7803-7422-3				2002							187	194		10.1109/ECUMN.2002.1002105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ECUMN.2002.1002105													WOS:000176123200023

The state of a synergetic computer is translated to that of order parameters whose dynamics is described by a stochastic differential equation. The order parameter converges to the Boltzmann distribution, under some condition on the drift term, derived by the Fokker-Planck equation. The network can learn the dynamics of the order parameters from a nonlinear potential. This property is necessary to design the coefficient values of the synergetic computer. We propose a searching function for the image processing executed by the synergetic computer. It is shown that the image processing with the searching function is superior to the usual image-associative function of synergetic computation. The proposed network can be related, as a special case, to the discrete-state Boltzmann machine by some transformation. Finally, the extended symmetric diffusion network is applied to the estimation problem of an entire density function, as well as the proposed searching function for the image processing.																			0899-7667					AUG 15	1999	11	6					1475	1491		10.1162/089976699300016322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089976699300016322								10423504					WOS:000081806000010

Specifically, the design problem is to determine the optimal pedestrianisation locations (i.e. the optimal set of pedestrian-only streets) in multi-modal transport systems, given a network of candidate pedestrian-only streets. The modeling approach proposed is mathematical programs with flow equilibrium and modal equity constraints. The modal equity constraints are introduced to balance the benefits and/or disbenefits to users of various transport modes, under a pedestrianisation scheme. A bi-level model is proposed to determine the optimal pedestrianisation locations: the upper level seeks to minimize the total cost of the multi-modal transport system while the lower level addresses the multi-modal network equilibrium problem. The lower level, formulated as a VI problem, allows for interactions between various transport modes, especially those between motorized and non-motorized modes. These interactions are of vital importance in Hong Kong's multi-modal transport network, owing to the high traffic density and limited road space. A case study based on the central business district of Hong Kong, "Central", is employed to illustrate the applications of the proposed model and solution algorithms.

J	Vali-Siar, MM; Roghanian, E				Vali-Siar, Mohammad Mahdi; Roghanian, Emad			Sustainable, resilient and responsive mixed supply chain network design under hybrid uncertainty with considering COVID-19 pandemic disruption	SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION												The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic is a disruption that has adversely affected many supply chains (SCs) around the world and further proved the necessity of combination and interaction of resilience and sustainability. In This paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for responsive, resilient and sustainable mixed open and closed-loop supply chain network design (SCND) problem. The uncertainty of the problem is handled with a hybrid robust-stochastic optimization approach. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method and a constructive heuristic (CH) algorithm are developed for overcoming problem complexity and solving large-scale instances. In order to assess the performance of the mathematical model and solution methods, some test instances are generated. The computations showed that the model and the solution methods are efficient and can obtain high-quality solutions in suitable CPU times. Other analyses and computations are done based on a real case study in the tire industry. The results demonstrate that resilient strategies are so effective and can improve economic, environmental and social dimensions substantially. Research findings suggest that the proposed model can be used as an efficient tool for designing sustainable and resilient SCs and the related decision-makings. Also, our findings prove that resilience is necessary for continued SC sustainability. It is concluded that using proposed resilience strategies simultaneously brings the best outcome for SC objectives.

Embedding virtual networks to a shared substrate network, which is termed as virtual network embedding problem, is widely believed as one of the most significant challenges in such context. For this problem, prior work primarily focuses on either (i) maximizing the revenues by accommodating more virtual network requests or (ii) minimizing the energy consumption by consolidating the virtual networks into minimum number of substrate nodes. In this paper, we aim at achieving these two goals simultaneously. We first formulate the virtual network embedding problem into a multi-objective integer linear programming. We then design an artificial immune system based algorithm to solve this programming. In this algorithm, (i) we design a discrete approach to encode the virtual node mapping solution as an antibody; (ii) to initialize the antibodies, we design two adaptive revenue and energy aware strategies for the node and link mapping, respectively, to strike a balance between revenue and energy costs; (iii) we design corresponding customized strategies in the cloning, crossover and mutation process of artificial immune system in virtual network embedding context; (iv) for the generated antibodies, we leverage the Pareto optimality for evaluating their quality. Through extensive simulations, we show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the revenue and the energy consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Moattar			Integrated strategic and tactical supply chain planning with price-sensitive demands	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH												This paper deals with the supply chain network design and planning for a multi-commodity and multi-layer network over a planning horizon with multiple periods in which demands of customer zones are considered to be price dependent. These prices determine the demands using plausible price-demand relationships of customer zones. The net income of the supply chain is maximized, while satisfying budget constraints for investment in network design. In addition, a new approach is considered for capacity planning to make the problem more realistic. In this regard, when production plants are opened and expanded, capacity options are taken into account for manufacturing operations. Furthermore, several aspects relevant to real world applications are captured in the problem. Different interconnected time periods in the planning horizon are considered for strategic and tactical decisions in the problem and then, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed. The performance and applications of the model are investigated by several test problems with reasonable sizes. The numerical results illustrate that obtained solutions after solving the MILP model by using CPLEX solver are acceptable. Moreover, using an alternative pricing approach, a tight upper bound is provided for the problem. In addition, a deep sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the validity and performance of the proposed model.

The development of WSNs in recent years has been facilitated by the availability of sensors that are smaller, less expensive, and more intelligent. The design of a WSN depends significantly on its desired applications and must take into account factors such as the environment, the design objectives of the application, the associated costs, the necessary hardware, and any applicable system constraints. In this study, we propose mathematical models for a routing protocol (network design) under particular resource restrictions within a wireless sensor network. We consider two types of constraints: the distance between the linking sensors and the energy used by the sensors. The proposed models aim to identify energy-efficient paths that minimize the energy consumption of the network from the source sensor to the base station. The computational results show that the presented models can be used efficiently and applied to other network design contexts with resource restrictions (e.g., to multi-level supply chain networks).

Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to supportflexible bitwidth(1-8 bits) to further improve the computation efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading off accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both time-consuming and usually sub-optimal. There are plenty of specialized hardware accelerators for neural networks, but little research has been done to design specialized neural networks optimized for a particular hardware accelerator. The latter is demanding given the much longer design cycle of silicon than neural nets. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way. In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ) framework which automatically determine the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size, we employ a hardware simulator to generate the direct feedback signals to the RL agent. Compared with other conventional methods, our framework is fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively reduced the latency by 1.4-1.95 x and the energy consumption by 1.9 xwith negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits) quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy and model size) are drastically different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies, which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware architecture design.

New algorithm for the flexibility index problem of quadratic systems	AICHE JOURNAL												A new flexibility index algorithm for systems under uncertainty and represented by quadratic inequalities is presented. Inspired by the outer-approximation algorithm for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming, a similar iterative strategy is developed. The subproblem, which is a nonlinear program, is constructed by fixing the vertex directions since this class of systems is proved to have a vertex solution if the entries on the diagonal of the Hessian matrix are non-negative. By overestimating the nonlinear constraints, a linear min-max problem is formulated. By dualizing the inner maximization problem, and introducing new variables and constraints, the master problem is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program. By iteratively solving the subproblem and master problem, the algorithm can be guaranteed to converge to the flexibility index. Numerical examples including a heat exchanger network, a process network, and a unit commitment problem are presented to illustrate the computational efficiency of the algorithm.

In order to address more general NNs, the parameter and the period mismatches are both considered, that is, excluding parameters, periods of the target dynamic and the followers are also different. In addition, the constrainted target information is studied, where the logarithmic quantizer is used to overcome the limited communication capacity and Bernoulli processes are employed to model cases of the information loss. A new period is established based on the lowest common multiple period of the target dynamic and the followers to obtain an augmented synchronization error system (ASES). Further, a suboptimal iterative algorithm is proposed to cut down the QS range of the ASES and the corresponding controllers are designed. At last, the controller design method is illustrated by a numerical example.

In sensor network, each individual sensor can receive not only its own measurement but also its neighboring sensors' measurements according to the interconnection topology to estimate the system states. Our attention is focused on the design of distributed fuzzy filters to guarantee the filtering error dynamic system to be mean-square asymptotically stable with an average performance. Sufficient conditions for the obtained filtering error dynamic system are proposed by applying an comparison model and the scaled small gain theorem. Based on the measurements and estimates of the system states and its neighbors for each sensor, the solution of the parameters of the distributed fuzzy filters is characterized in terms of the feasibility of a convex optimization problem.

Apart from the short-haul bus, the development of bike-sharing systems has led to a powerful supplementary feeder service. Most research on feeder services focuses on the separate design of bike and bus systems, but their joint design deserves further study. This research proposes a bi-level mixed-integer programming model to simultaneously design the locations of feeder buses and shared bike stations as well as the bus routes. A modified genetic algorithm that encapsulates the fixed-point iteration and Frank-Wolfe algorithms is developed to solve the model for large network applications.

J	Neri, M; Guelpa, E; Verda, V				Neri, Manfredi; Guelpa, Elisa; Verda, Vittorio			Design and connection optimization of a district cooling network: Mixed integer programming and heuristic approach	APPLIED ENERGY												In densely populated areas, district energy systems can bring significant savings and an overall reduction of CO2 emissions. In particular, district cooling is a valid alternative to conventional cooling technologies. Among the issues related to district cooling there is the relative smaller temperature difference between supply and return respect to district heating. This increases the design and operational costs. Consequently a strong focus is needed on the optimization of district cooling networks. In this paper a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) and a heuristic model have been developed and implemented for the topology optimization of district cooling networks. The models allow to estimate: (i) the optimal design, (ii) the set of buildings that is convenient to connect to a district cooling network. They have been applied to three different case studies and the main results obtained by the two methods have been assessed and compared. The heuristic method proved to be faster, especially for complex networks. On the other hand, the MILP is more precise and the maximum difference among the models in terms of objective function is about 1.3%. A graph clustering method has also been implemented to improve the performances of the heuristic approach by facilitating its convergence.The models through the optimizations can bring savings up to 3.16% of the total life-cycle cost depending on the case study. They could therefore represent a potential tool that supports decision makers in the planning phase of district cooling networks.

Because different layers have different redundancy and sensitivity to data bit width. Reducing the data bit width will result in a loss of accuracy. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the optimal bit width for different parts of the network with guaranteed accuracy. Mixed precision quantization can effectively reduce the amount of computation while keeping the model accuracy basically unchanged. In this paper, a hardware-aware mixed precision quantization strategy optimal assignment algorithm adapted to low bit width is proposed, and reinforcement learning is used to automatically predict the mixed precision that meets the constraints of hardware resources. In the state-space design, the standard deviation of weights is used to measure the distribution difference of data, the execution speed feedback of simulated neural network accelerator inference is used as the environment to limit the action space of the agent, and the accuracy of the quantization model after retraining is used as the reward function to guide the agent to carry out deep reinforcement learning training. The experimental results show that the proposed method obtains a suitable model layer-by-layer quantization strategy under the condition that the computational resources are satisfied, and the model accuracy is effectively improved. The proposed method has strong intelligence and certain universality and has strong application potential in the field of mixed precision quantization and embedded neural network model deployment.																			1546-2218	1546-2226					2024	79	1					819	836		10.32604/cmc.2024.047108	http://dx.doi.org/10.32604/cmc.2024.047108													WOS:001224911800009

Traffic Engineering (TE) for next generation multimedia services is a new challenge for multilayer co-operation within these communication networks. In MPLS/GMPLS based IP over WDM networks, the TE process is accomplished by the establishment of an adequate logical topology, above the underlying optical topology. However, under dynamic traffic pattern, optimal logical topology design or minimization of transitions when reconfiguring it, cannot always lead to efficient traffic handling. Logical topology stability and reconfiguration require resource availability in the network. We are addressing here a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for the resource saving logical topology design (RSLTD) for reconfigurable network under dynamic traffic pattern.

Transmission scheduling over the shared channels needs to be performed so that at any time instant, each channel transmits only one control input. The main novelty of this work lies in the idea of scheduling/control co-design which suggests that the design of the transmission scheduling and the controller should be treated jointly rather than separately. By virtue of such a co-design, a sufficient condition is obtained for the channels' overall quality of service required for stabilization given in terms of twice of the topological entropy of the plant.

A mixed-integer non-linear programming model (MINLP) is presented to address the integrated VRP and M/M/C queueing system. The suggested model makes decisions about optimal routing, delivery time interval to customers, number of servers in traditional retailers, inventory replenishment policies, and retailers' price. For the first time, this model considers two retailing channels simultaneously under different uncertainty, including demand, delivery lead time, service time, and delivery time interval to customers. The inventory model also follows a continuous-time Markov chain. The small-scale test problems are solved using GAMS software. Since the problem is NP-hard, this study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance of 13 different metaheuristics. The ant lion optimiser, dragonfly algorithm, grasshopper optimisation algorithm, Harris-hawks optimisation, moth-flame optimisation algorithm, multi-verse optimizer, sine cosine algorithm, salp-swarm algorithm, the whale optimisation algorithm, grey-wolf optimiser, genetic algorithm, differential evolution, and particle swarm optimization are algorithms that were chosen for this study. Comprehensive statistical tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of these methods. Furthermore, the model is executed for construction material producers as a case study.

The hypothesis was that a secondary layer of CNCs at the WPI-stabilized oil-water interface could protect the interfacial protein layer against in vitro gastric digestion by pepsin at 37 degrees C. A combination of transmission electron microscopy, zeta-potential measurements, interfacial shear viscosity measurements and theoretical surface coverage considerations suggested the presence of CNCs and WPI together at the O/W interface, owing to the electrostatic attraction between complementarily charged WPI and CNCs at pH 3. Microstructural analysis and droplet sizing revealed that the presence of CNCs increased the resistance of the interfacial protein film to rupture by pepsin, thus inhibiting droplet coalescence in the gastric phase, which occurs rapidly in an emulsion stabilized by WPI alone. It appeared that there was an optimum concentration of CNCs at the interface for such barrier effects. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results further confirmed that the presence of 3 wt% of CNCs reduced the rate and extent of proteolysis of protein at the interface. Besides, evidence of adsorption of CNCs to the protein-coated droplets to form more rigid layers, there is also the possibility that network formation by the CNCs in the bulk (continuous) phase reduced the kinetics of proteolysis. Nevertheless, structuring emulsions with mixed protein-particle layers could be an effective strategy to tune and control interfacial barrier properties during gastric passage of emulsions.

We proposed a two phase mixed integer linear program model for defining optimum locations for collection points, transfer stations and recycling facilities. In the first stage, proposed model finds a minimum number of collection point's locations depending on the distance from end users to collection points. The second model's phase defines optimal locations of a transfer and recycling facilities while minimizes the reverse logistics costs. The proposed modeling approach was tested on the Belgrade city area.

They have proposed a series of deep unfolding networks (DUNs) with the characteristics of having good interpretability and high-quality reconstruction. However, most DUNs only use the inherent CS model, which leads to the limited reconstruction performance. In addition, simple reconstruction networks cannot well remove noises from features. To address the above issues, this article proposes a wavelet-domain consistency-constrained CS framework. We introduce discrete wavelet transform (DWT) into the CS optimization model and unfold its optimization algorithm into a deep dual-domain hybrid reconstruction network. The overall network of the proposed method is named memory-boosted dual-domain guidance filtering network (MDGF-Net). MDGF-Net utilizes frequency-domain information to supplement spatial-domain image reconstruction. Furthermore, guided filtering is leveraged to filter out noises in the reconstructed features. Here, we design two consecutive denoising modules, namely, the dual-domain memory-boosted guided filtering module and the self-guided memory-boosted filtering module (SGMFM). By combining the guided filtering and long short-term memory mechanism, these two modules can effectively reduce the information loss while removing the feature noise and retaining the valid information. Numerous experimental results on various datasets indicate that the proposed MDGF-Net achieves superior reconstruction performance compared with several state-of-the-art DUNs.

The communication topology among agents is characterized by an undirected and connected graph, and there exist network-induced delays during data transmissions. Based on recursive equations, a prediction strategy is proposed to actively compensate for the effects of network-induced delays. Then, an event-triggered mechanism is introduced to avoid continuous control updates and continuous communication among agents. According to the above prediction strategy and event-triggered mechanism, a distributed external consensus control protocol is proposed, by which system stability is ensured and the external consensus can be achieved. Finally, numerical simulation is made to illustrate the validity of the proposed protocol.

This problem has motivated research in neural networks for scheduling. The novel concept of continuous suitability functions defined over a continuous time domain has been developed to represent soft temporal relationships between activities. All constraints and preferences are automatically translated into the weights of an appropriately designed artificial neural network. The constraints are subject to propagation and consistency enhancement in order to increase the number of explicitly represented constraints. Equipped with a novel stochastic neuron update rule, the resulting GDS-network effectively implements a Las Vegas-type algorithm to generate good schedules with an unparalleled efficiency. When provided with feedback from execution the network allows dynamic schedule revision and repair.																			0305-0548	1873-765X				APR-MAY	1992	19	3-4					209	240		10.1016/0305-0548(92)90045-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0305-0548(92)90045-7													WOS:A1992HP18700005

This study describes the specific features of green supply-chain design considering end-of-life products. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model to obtain the optimal closed-loop supply-chain (CLSC) network design, in which recovery process occurs in three different ways: material recovery, component recovery, and product recovery. An extensive analysis is supported by numerical results which inform CLSC managers about the opportunities of enhancing product returns in terms of quality and quantity. To define a better CLSC strategy to increase system profitability, the volume of product returns and corresponding quality conditions should be considered in the design of a CLSC network. The numerical study provides information for us to discuss the potential benefits of product-recovery processes and the reaction of system profitability to the changes in specific CLSC parameters.

An analytical non-dimensional transfer function model is developed to predict the isolation behavior of a cantilever beam with a tip mass. It is shown that beam network isolators exhibit a good degree of versatility at the design level. The static stiffness and the isolation forces are scalable at the design level, the dynamic stiffness can also be tuned to achieve any force reduction ratio in the absence of damping. Furthermore mutlifrequency isolation is possible due to the nature of continuous systems, thus, multi-mode isolation frequencies can be tuned closer to each other. Isolation frequency clustering is also possible by tuning the beam-mass components. As a proof of concept, the analytical results are validated with an experimental study whereby the shear force is recorded at the root of a cantilever beam with a tip mass that is subject to harmonic point force excitation. The experimental results show that the root shear response at the first isolation frequency is reduced by 78% after the addition of a tip mass equivalent to 230% of the beam mass.																					978-0-7918-8562-8				2021									V07BT07A062															WOS:000883344800062

Modeling of collision resolution algorithm in lonworks networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION 2007, VOL 9, PTS A-C: MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND CONTROL					ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition	NOV 10-16, 2007	Seattle, WA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers				The industrial organization of productive processes have presented a tendency for dispersion and distribution of manufacturing plants based on an increase of resources and functionality of information and mobility technology. In this sense, Local Operating Networks (LON, LonWorks) is the name of one of the leading technologies in sensor/control networking, addressed to a wide range of applications with topology free technology. In spite of its popularity, only a few design tools are available to simulate LonWorks architectures and predict their performance. In this paper, a model of the collision resolution algorithm of LonWorks is described. The approach developed in this work is based on the characterization of LonWorks networks as Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS), since dynamic behavior is defined through the discrete events and discrete states. The proposed procedure employs techniques that are derived from interpreted Petri net, which has been used as an efficient tool for modeling, analysis and control of DEDS. In this context, the media access control sublayer (MAC) is modeled in different levels of abstraction: a conceptual model which is obtained using the PFS (Production Flow Schema) technique, and a functional model by using MFG (Mark Flow Graph). The MFG abstraction level describes details in a functional form preserving the description activities of upper levels. This procedure allows the structured development of models, facilitating the modeling process of the algorithm specification. The result presented in this paper for a single network segment can be integrated into a global networks modeling, since the proposed procedure decomposes the model systematically according to a hierarchal approach into different modules. In this way, it is straightforward to integrate single segments networks models into complex networks.

Study design A retrospective cohort study using the Neonatal Research Network (NRN) database of inborn in-fants, gestational age 220-286 weeks or birth weight of 401-1000 g, born between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019, and surviving >12 hours. The primary outcome was SIP through 14 days. Time of last ANS dose prior to delivery was analyzed as a continuous variable (using 169 hours for durations >168 hours or no steroid exposure). Associations between ANS, Indo-D1, and SIP were obtained from a multilevel hierarchical generalized linear mixed model after covariate adjustment. This yielded aOR and 95% CI. Results Of 6851 infants, 243 had SIP (3.5%). ANS exposure occurred in 6393 infants (93.3%) and IndoD1 was given to 1863 infants (27.2%). The time (median, IQR) from last dose of ANS to delivery was 32.5 hours (6-81) vs 37.1 hours (7-110) for infants with or without SIP, respectively (P = .10). Indo-D1 was given to 51.9 vs 26.3% of in-fants with SIP vs no SIP, respectively (P < .0001). Adjusted analysis indicated no interaction between time of last ANS dose and Indo-D1 for SIP (P = .7). Indo-D1 but not ANS was associated with increased odds of SIP (aOR: 1.73, 1.21-2.48, P = .003). Conclusion The odds of SIP were increased after receipt of Indo-D1. Exposure to ANS prior to Indo-D1 was not associated with an increase in SIP. (J Pediatr 2023;259:113457).

However, the inverse uncertainty characteristics of this kind of pollution source inversion problem have not yet been clearly elucidated. To fill this gap, stochastic analysis approaches, including a regional sensitivity analysis method, identifiability plot and perturbation methods, were employed to conduct an empirical investigation on generic inverse uncertainty characteristics under a well-accepted uncertainty analysis framework. Case studies based on field tracer experiments and synthetic numerical tracer experiments revealed several new rules. For example, the release load can be most easily inverted, and the source location is responsible for the largest uncertainty among the source parameters. The diffusion and convection processes are more sensitive than the dilution and pollutant attenuation processes to the optimization of objective functions in terms of structural uncertainty. The differences among the different objective functions are smaller for instantaneous release than for continuous release cases. Small monitoring errors affect the inversion results only slightly, which can be ignored in practice. Interestingly, the estimated values of the release location and time negatively deviate from the real values, and the extent is positively correlated with the relative size of the mixing zone to the objective river reach. These new findings improve decision making in emergency responses to sudden water pollution and guide the monitoring network design.(c) Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2018					Jiang, Jiping/P-2335-2017; Wang, Nannan/U-8505-2019; Zheng, Yi/B-1333-2012; jiang, jiping/AAC-8593-2019; Han, Feng/AAG-1212-2019	Wang, Nannan/0000-0001-8995-5302; 													2095-2201	2095-221X				OCT	2018	12	5							6	10.1007/s11783-018-1081-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-018-1081-4													WOS:000445891500001

On the Evaluation of Complex Networks Designs for an Energy-Efficient IP/WDM Core Network	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												As the Internet grows in capacity, the energy consumption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are significantly increasing. Significant research efforts on energy conservation have been devoted to devise different technological solutions to address raised concerns surrounding the power consumption of networking equipment and its impact firstly on the emission of greenhouse gases and secondly on electricity bills. In this work, we investigate energy-efficient physical topologies for NSF IP over wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) network for the purpose of minimizing energy consumption by redesigning its current physical connectivity. We implement different network topologies, such as implementing the small-world, scale-free (SFN), and random networks on the NSF network, then evaluate and compare its physical properties and network power consumption with the current NSF topology design using a mixed-integer linear programming model, all with the aim of minimizing the network total power consumption. The evaluation shall optimize and minimize the embodied energy consumption of network equipment in the IP and optical layers. Results have demonstrated that the implementation of the proposed energy-minimized topology designs can significantly improve the node's clustering coefficient, reduce network's diameter, and reduce energy consumption of the NSF IP over WDM network to 28% if compared with the current design implementation.

This study proposes a multi-domain equivalent method for fracture network to estimate the deformation properties of complex fractured rock mass. It comprehends both the advantages of the discrete fracture network model and the equivalent continuum model to capture the features of discontinuities explicitly while reducing computational intensity. The complex fracture network is stochastically split into a number of subfracture networks according to the domain, length or angle. An analytical solution is derived to infer theoretically the relationship between the elastic moduli of the original complex fractured rock mass and the split subfractured rock masses by introducing a correction term based on the deformation superposition principle. Numerical simulations are conducted to determine the elastic moduli of split subfractured rock masses using universal distinct element code (UDEC), while the elastic modulus of the original model is estimated based on the currently proposed analytical relationship. The results show that the estimation accuracy with the current domain-based splitting model is far superior compared to those with the other two splitting models. Thus, the estimation method of elastic modulus of complex fractured rock mass based on domain splitting mode of fracture network is identified as the multi-domain equivalent method proposed in this paper. The reliability of this method is evaluated, and its high computational efficiency is demonstrated through exemplification with regard to different geometric configurations for stochastically artificial discrete fracture network. The proposed multi-domain equivalent method constructs the theoretical framework except for the regression analysis hypothesis compared to the density-reduced model equivalent method.

J	Dai, LY; Wieselthier, JE				Dai, LY; Wieselthier, JE			Alignment properties in ordinal comparison of discrete event dynamic systems	DISCRETE EVENT DYNAMIC SYSTEMS-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												In the design and optimization of discrete event dynamic systems, it is often necessary to order alternative designs based on their relative performance, i.e., to rank them from best to worst. In this paper, alignment of observed performance orders with true orders is considered and properties of the alignment are investigated. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a measure of agreement between the observed performance orders and the true ones. It is shown that Spearman's coefficient converges exponentially in the simulation time or observation time, which gives a strong evidence of the efficiency of order comparison for discrete event dynamic systems. In the context of simulation, the effect of simulation dependence on the alignment is also discussed. It is found that neither independent simulation nor the scheme of common random numbers (CRN), a popular scheme for variance reduction, can yield dominant performance. Finally, numerical examples based on a networking optimization problem are provided to illustrate the convergence of Spearman's coefficient. In these examples, the standard clock (SC) simulation technique provides much faster convergence than either independent simulations or CRN simulations. Both the SC and CRN methods use the same random number sequence to drive many events in parallel; however, under SC the events driving the parallel experiments are all identical, whereas under CRN they may be different.																			0924-6703					AUG	1999	9	3					261	284		10.1023/A:1008301531221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008301531221													WOS:000081464200003

Highly Effective Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Research Teams: Critical Success Factors	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE												BACKGROUND: Bringing new therapies to patients with rare diseases depends in part on optimizing clinical trial conduct through efficient study start-up processes and rapid enrollment. Suboptimal execution of clinical trials in academic medical centers not only results in high cost to institutions and sponsors, but also delays the availability of new therapies. Addressing the factors that contribute to poor outcomes requires novel, systematic approaches tailored to the institution and disease under study. OBJECTIVE: To use clinical trial performance metrics data analysis to select high-performing cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical research teams and then identify factors contributing to their success. DESIGN: Mixed-methods research, including semi-structured qualitative interviews of high-performing research teams. PARTICIPANTS: CF research teams at nine clinical centers from the CF Foundation Therapeutics Development Network. APPROACH: Survey of site characteristics, direct observation of team meetings and facilities, and semi-structured interviews with clinical research team members and institutional program managers and leaders in clinical research. KEY RESULTS: Critical success factors noted at all nine high-performing centers were: 1) strong leadership, 2) established and effective communication within the research team and with the clinical care team, and 3) adequate staff. Other frequent characteristics included a mature culture of research, customer service orientation in interactions with study participants, shared efficient processes, continuous process improvement activities, and a businesslike approach to clinical research. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical research metrics allowed identification of high-performing clinical research teams.

Guaranteed cost fault-tolerant controller for the new networked control systems with time-varying sensor faults is designed in this paper. Based on time delay of the network transmission environment, the networked control systems with sensor faults are modeled as a discrete-time system with uncertain parameters. And the model of networked control systems is related to the boundary values of the sensor faults. Moreover, using Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequalities (LMI) approach, the guaranteed cost fault-tolerant controller is verified to render such networked control systems asymptotically stable. Finally, simulations are included to demonstrate the theoretical results.

For this purpose, a distributed consensus filter (DCF) is proposed based on Lyapunov stability theory for every node in a sensor network. It will be proved that the mean square of the estimation error is exponentially ultimately bounded. This filter can estimate the states of nonlinear stochastic systems, the nonlinear functions of which satisfy a pseudo Lipschitz condition. Sufficient conditions for the existence of this filter are sensor network connectivity and LMI solvability of DCF. Furthermore, a criterion is presented to optimize the filter gain based on minimizing the upper consensus bound of estimation error. Simulation results show the promising performance of the proposed filter.																			1561-8625	1934-6093				JUL	2017	19	4			SI		1284	1294		10.1002/asjc.1551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asjc.1551													WOS:000406934300004

To address this problem, a two -stage stochastic programming model is formulated. Using the Latin hypercube sampling approach, a mixed integer linear programming reformulation model is provided. To deal with the challenges of sampling in solving efficiency, an improved sample average approximation method is proposed by integrating an improved subgradient algorithm with the dual decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation technique. Computational results of several numerical instances followed by a real -life case clearly support the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Comparative analysis shows that integrating temporary outsourcing service into multi -period 4PL network design indeed changes the 4PL network structure and enhances the supply chain performance at a lower overall cost.

Unknown functions are approximated via online radial basis function (RBF) neural network, high order continuous differentiable functions are introduced into Lyapunov function to realize the estimation of unknown parameters and unknown boundary, and a new dead zone function is designed to replace symbolic function to realize the continuity of virtual control. During the design process, the backstepping design method is applied to deal with the cross terms generated by the tuning function. Barbalat's lemma proves that all the signals of closed-loop system are bounded and the output tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin. A simulation example are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the control scheme.

In practice, it is necessary to avoid interference by deploying guard bands between two distinct receptions. However, using guard bands typically reduces spectrum efficiency. In this work, we study the impact of guard bands on spectrum efficiency under different spectrum sharing schemes. Specifically, we model cognitive radio network as a continuous-time Markov process. We derive blocking probability, forced termination probability, spectrum efficiency and average number of guard bands using our Markov model. Using these metrics, we then study and analyze the impact of using guard bands on the performance of cognitive radio networks. We show that taking guard bands into consideration is critical as disregarding this realistic issue results in inaccurate conclusions and outcomes.																			1550-3607		978-1-4799-6664-6				2016										10.1109/ICC.2016.7511022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2016.7511022													WOS:000390993202055

A new impulse-free discrete-time HOCGNN with time-varying delays and connection weights is firstly constructed, and the relationship between the solutions of original systems and new HOCGNNs is indicated by a technical lemma. From which, the global exponential stability criteria for the zero equilibrium are derived by using an inductive idea and the properties of nonsingular M-matrices. The effectiveness of the obtained stability criteria is illustrated by numerical examples. Compared with the previous results, this paper has three advantages: (i) The Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is not required; (ii) The obtained global exponential stability criteria are applied to check whether a matrix is a nonsingular M-matrix, which can be conveniently tested; (iii) The proposed approach applies to most of discrete-time system models with impulses and delays.

A new mixed-integer programming model is proposed to minimize the total sum of the nominal and expected failure costs. This model considers complete and partial disruption at hubs. In addition, we propose a new hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on genetic and imperialist competitive algorithms. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with a new lower bound method in terms of the CPU time and solution quality. Furthermore, we conclude that a considerable improvement in the reliability of the network can be achieved with only a slight increase in the total cost. Finally, we demonstrate that the networks designed using our model are less conservative and more robust to disruption compared with those designed based on other robustness measures.

More than 60% of the patients present relapsing and remitting chronic arthralgia with debilitating pain lasting for years. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) appears promising as a novel neuromodulation approach for pain-related networks to alleviate pain in several pain syndromes. Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of tDCS (C3/Fp2 montage) on pain, muscle strength, functionality and quality of life in chronic arthralgia. Methods and analysis This protocol is a single-centre, parallel-design, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial. Forty participants will be randomised to either an active or sham tDCS. A total of 10 sessions will be administered over 2 weeks (one per weekday) using a monophasic continuous current with an intensity of 2 mA for 20 min. Participants will be evaluated at baseline, after the 10th session, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after intervention. Primary outcome: pain assessed using numeric rating scale and algometry. Secondary outcomes: muscle strength, functionality and quality of life. The effects of stimulation will be calculated using a mixed analysis of variance model. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences of Trairi, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (No. 2.413.851) and registered on the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials.

Rheological properties of calcium carbonate self-setting injectable paste	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA												With the development of minimally invasive surgical techniques, there is growing interest in the research and development of injectable biomaterials with controlled theological properties In this context, the theological properties and injectability characteristics of an original CaCO3 self-setting paste have been investigated. Two complementary rheometrical procedures have been established using a controlled stress rheometer to follow the structure build-up at rest or during gentle mixing and/or handling oil the one hand, and the likely shear-induced breakdown of this structure at 25 or 35 degrees C on the other The data obtained clearly show the influence of temperature on the development of a cement microstructure during setting, in all cases leading to a microporous cement made of an entangled network of aragonite-CaCO3 needle-like crystals Linear viscoelastic measurements arriving from an oscillatory shear at low deformation showed a progressive increase in the viscous modulus (G") during paste setting, which is enhanced by an increase in temperature. In addition, steady shear measurements revealed the shear-thinning behaviour of this self-setting paste over an extended period after paste preparation and its ability to re-build through progressive paste setting at rest The shear-thinning behaviour of this self-setting system was confirmed using the injectability system and a procedure we designed. The force needed to extrude a homogeneous and continuous column of paste decreases strongly upon injection and reaches a weight level to apply on the syringe piston around 2.5 kg, revealing the ease of injection of this CaCO3 self-setting paste (C) 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.

The underlying system is represented by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model, and in addition by the description of the WSN under consideration. The structure of the WSN is established on a deterministic one. Based on an event-triggering condition tailored for each sensor, distributed fuzzy filters are established using the triggered measurements of the smart sensors. As a result, an augmented stochastic system is presented for the distributed filtering design. A robust mean-square asymptotic stability criterion is explored using the Lyapunov stability theory and the Disk stability constraint is applied to improve the performance of the distributed filters. An optimization solution to obtaining the parameters of the distributed filters is developed. Subsequently, a computer-simulated example helps to illustrate the validity of the proposed new filtering design techniques.

Adult Neurogenesis in the Hippocampus From a Perspective of Discrimination and Generalization: A Hypothesis	PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The function of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is not yet completely understood, though many competing theories have attempted to explain the function of these newly-generated neurons. Most theories give adult neurogenesis a role in aiding known hippocampal/dentate gyrus functions. Other theories offer a novel role for these new cells based on their unique physiological qualities, such as their low excitability threshold. Many behavioral tests have been used to test these theories, but results have been inconsistent and often contradictory. Substantial variability in tests and protocols may be at least partially responsible for the mixed results. On the other hand, conflicting results arising from the same tests can serve as aids in elucidating the function of adult neurogenesis. Here, we offer a hypothesis that considers the cognitive nature of tasks commonly used to assess the function of adult neurogenesis, and introduce a dichotomy between tasks focused on discrimination vs. generalization. We view these two aspects as opposite ends of the continuous spectrum onto which traditional tests can be mapped. We propose that high neurogenesis favors behavioral discrimination while low adult neurogenesis favors behavioral generalization of a knowledge or rule. Since many tasks require both, the effects of neurogenesis could be cancelled out in many cases. Although speculative, we hope that our view presents an interesting and testable hypothesis of the effect of adult neurogenesis in traditional behavioral tasks. We conclude that new, carefully designed behavioral tests may be necessary to reach a final consensus on the role of adult neurogenesis in behavior.

Driven by safety and privacy concerns in network communications and online services, much theoretical work has been conducted in order to design opaque systems. A system is opaque if an external observer in unable to infer a "secret" about the system behavior. This paper aims to review the most commonly used techniques of opacity validation for deterministic models and opacity quantification for probabilistic ones. Available complexity results are also provided. Finally, we review existing tools for opacity validation and current applications.

Then, the mixed-type attacks are expressed uniformly, and a synchronization error system is established using this function. A finite-horizon l(2) - l(infinity) performance is proposed, and sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the synchronization error system satisfies this performance. The controllers are then obtained by a recursive linear matrix inequality algorithm. At last, a simulation result to show the feasibility of the developed results is given.

The network-induced delays in both communication links (to and from the controller) are assumed to behave as Markov chains. An analytical approach is presented to calculate the transition probabilities of the Markovian network-induced de-lays. By employing the augmentation method, the resultant system is converted into a delay-free uncertain singular Markovian jump system with bounded transition probabili-ties. New conditions are established to assure that the uncertain NCS satisfies an H-infinity, per-formance requirement. Moreover, sufficient conditions for robust H-infinity, output feedback con-troller design are expressed in terms of LMIs. Finally, numerical examples are presented to verify the validity of the proposed controller design method. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Compared with network cost, the power consumption may eventually become the barrier to the expansion of the Internet.

J	Raghavan, S; Stanojevic, D				Raghavan, S.; Stanojevic, Daliborka			Branch and Price for WDM Optical Networks with No Bifurcation of Flow	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING												The second generation of optical networks with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is based on the notion of two layer networks, where the first layer represents a logical topology defined over the physical topology of optical fibers and the second layer represents multiple traffic requests combined (multiplexed) over the paths established in the logical topology. Because the design of both of these layers is challenging by itself, researchers have mainly focused on solving these problems either independently or in a sequential fashion. In this paper, we look at the WDM optical network design problem with nonbifurcated traffic flows and propose an exact branch-and-price procedure that simultaneously solves logical topology design and traffic routing over the established logical topology. The unique feature of the proposed algorithm is that it works with a row-incomplete mathematical formulation and two types of variables that exponentially grow in number with the problem size. We discuss computational issues related to the use of this procedure and propose two approximate branch-and-price procedures that can be used to obtain lower and upper bounds for this problem. Finally, we present the results of our computational experiments for two design objectives and alternative optical network settings.

Computational design and on-site mobile robotic construction of an adaptive reinforcement beam network for cross-laminated timber slab panels	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION												Timber slabs design is currently limited to grid layouts derived from prefabricated rectangular panels. The lack of adaptability of timber slabs to accommodate multiple span directions makes it difficult to compete with reinforced concrete slabs constructed on site. This paper describes an adaptive slab system composed of thin CrossLaminated Timber (CLT) panels and robot-fabricated beam networks for reinforcement. The beam network was developed through intricate negotiation of structural optimization and fabrication constraints, which can adapt to changes in slab span and directions. A mobile robot platform that allows for on-site assembly of timber sticks into continuous beam networks was developed. The robot platform and slab system were tested with a case study pavilion. The co-design of the robot platform and the slab system fills the gap in on-site robotic timber construction and expands the design freedom of timber buildings.

This paper demonstrates the design and development of a hardwarefriendly nonlinear neuron model based on an intuitive control theory perspective. The neuron consists of a mixed-feedback system operating at multiple timescales to exhibit a variety of modalities that resemble the biophysical mechanisms found in neurophysiology. The single neuron dynamics emerge from four voltage-controlled current sources and features spiking and bursting output modes that can be controlled using tunable parameters. The bifurcation structures of the neuron, modeled as a 4D dynamical system, illustrate the roles of sources acting on different timescales in shaping the neural dynamics. For the first time, a neural network test chip consisting of 6 nonlinear bio-mimetic neurons and 10 tunable synapses was designed on 180nm CMOS technology. A 4-neuron network with inhibitory synapses of increasing strength was verified to achieve coupled rhythms. The test chip has an area of 0.6mm x 2mm and consumes 0.753mW of total average power.

A.; Orlowski, Sebastian; Wessaely, Roland			On Cut-Based Inequalities for Capacitated Network Design Polyhedra	NETWORKS												In this article, we study capacitated network design problems. We unify and extend polyhedral results for directed, bidirected, and undirected link capacity models. Valid inequalities based on a network cut are known to be strong in several special cases. We show that regardless of the link model, facets of the polyhedra associated with such a cut translate to facets of the original network design polyhedra if the two subgraphs defined by the network cut are (strongly) connected. Our investigation of the facial structure of the cutset polyhedra allows to complement existing polyhedral results for the three variants by presenting facet-defining flow-cutset inequalities in a unifying way. In addition, we present a new class of facet-defining inequalities, showing as well that flow-cutset inequalities alone do not suffice to give a complete description for single-commodity, single-module cutset polyhedra in the bidirected and undirected case - in contrast to a known result for the directed case. The practical importance of the theoretical investigations is highlighted in an extensive computational study on 27 instances from the Survivable Network Design Library (SNDlib).

This study focuses on the proof-of-concept of e(-)NETmix as regards global mass transfer properties by applying the limiting current technique for the ferricyanide-ferrocyanide reaction at different Reynolds numbers (Re). For Re from 100 to 1750, the volumetric mass transfer coefficients (k(m)A) ranged from similar to 1.3 x 10(-1) s(-1) to similar to 5.1 x 10(-1) s(-1) and the mass transfer coefficients (k(m)) ranged from similar to 6.8 x 10(-5) m s(-1) to similar to 2.7 x 10(-4) m s(-1). A comprehensive comparison of the e(-)NETmix reactor with a commercial electrochemical flow reactor, the MicroFlowCell from ElectroCell (Denmark), revealed k(m)A and k(m) values similar to 63-fold and similar to 8.6-fold higher in the new reactor, respectively, for similar Re. Moreover, the novel reactor showed mass transfer superiority over most existing reactors reported in the literature, allowing the attainment of k(m)A values up to similar to 54-fold higher for similar mean linear fluid velocities (nu(avg)) and k(m) values up to similar to 24-fold higher for similar Re. The superior performance of e(-)NETmix can be mainly attributed to the static mixer, which promotes convective mixing and the development of a laminar chaotic flow regime. This novel electrochemical flow reactor can be used to enhance several electrochemical and photoelectrochemical reactions.

The existing sports counting equipment is mostly contact wearable devices, sports do not have convenience. The concept of noncontact motion detection is emerging. In this article, a new noncontact repetitive motion counting method based on mmWave radar is studied, and the principle is as follows: the radar transmits the antenna to transmit the signal and the signal bounces when it meets the object. The receiving antenna receives the echo, and the echo is mixed with the transmitted signal through the filter to obtain the intermediate frequency (IF) signal. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to sample the IF signal, the sampled signal is 3D-FFT to obtain the horizontal angle change waveform. The wavelet packet transform (WPT)/variational mode decomposition (VMD) of the waveform is performed to count the peak, and the number of repeated movements is obtained and displayed. Indoor-outdoor experiments are designed to verify the robustness of the methods. By comparing the processing effect in complex indoor environments, it is proved that the two methods have a better processing effect on multipath interference of indoor repetitive motion. This article proves that it has high accuracy and has the advantages of noncontact and noninvasion of personal privacy by examining several repetitive movement methods of weightlifting, stretch horizontally, chest clipping, sideways dumbbells, squats, and touch toes.

J	Majozi, T				Majozi, Thokozani			Storage design for maximum wastewater reuse in multipurpose batch plants	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												This paper presents an algorithm for the minimization of reusable water storage in multipurpose batch plants. The algorithm is based on a two-stage approach, with each stage focusing on a dedicated objective function. In the first stage, the objective is the minimization of freshwater, given the maximum reusable water storage capacity. After the minimum freshwater target has been set, it is then fixed and used as an input parameter in the second stage. In the second stage, central reusable water storage capacity is a variable that must be optimized, subject to the minimum freshwater target set in the first stage. The overall formulation is based on a continuous-time approach developed by Majozi and Zhu [Ind. Chem. Eng. Res. 2001, 40 (25), 59355949], using a so-called state sequence network, and is an extension of recently published work on wastewater minimization using central reusable water storage in batch plants [Majozi, Comput. Chem. Eng. 2005, 29 (7), 1631-1646]. The algorithm has been applied to a case study in which a > 45% savings in freshwater demand was observed, compared to the case without the exploitation of water recycle and reuse. Moreover, a > 60% reduction in reusable water storage capacity was observed, in comparison to the situation in which the central reusable water storage capacity is fixed a priori. It is worthy of mention that the presented methodology is only applicable to batch processes that are characterized by single contaminants. Furthermore, the mathematical formulation on which it is based is nonlinear (mixed-integer nonlinear programming, MINLP) and nonconvex, which implies that global optimality cannot be guaranteed, except in special cases.

Above all, a new FxT stability lemma is given, which offers a more flexible condition and some more precise estimates of stabilized convergence time compared with the existing results. Subsequently, an economic and practical non -chattering continuous adaptive controller is designed, which is superior to the currently available ones by excluding the signum function and linear part and removing the parity restriction on the exponents in control law. Furthermore, by means of the Lyapunov method and the newly -established FxT stability theory, some novel FxT interlayer synchronization criteria are derived for the addressed two -layer multiweighted CDNs with the designed non -chattering continuous adaptive controller, and the synchronized settling time (SST) is also reckoned. It is found that the interlayer links weights can contribute to the interlayer synchronization, and the SST becomes smaller with the increase of interlayer link weight. Finally, the proposed results are validated by numerical examples.																			0960-0779	1873-2887				MAY	2024	182								114835	10.1016/j.chaos.2024.114835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2024.114835													WOS:001224316100001

Globally optimal simultaneous heat exchanger network synthesis and basic heat exchanger design	AICHE JOURNAL												In this article, we extend a previously developed globally optimal enumeration methodology for the synthesis of heat exchanger networks (HENs) to include the basic design of heat exchangers (HEXs). The method addresses together all trade-offs between network structure, energy usage, and the basic design of the HEXs. Without loss of generality, we focus on shell-and-tube HEXs. Unlike previous approaches, such as Pinch Analysis, Metaheuristic methods, or Mathematical Programming, our procedure guarantees global optimality. The procedure is not iterative and does not present any convergence challenges. We enumerate HEN structures using a mixed-integer linear programming method and we use Set Trimming followed by sorting for the HEX design. In addition, because some network structures are incompatible with single shell exchangers, we use multiple shell exchangers in series. The comparison of the results of the proposed approach with solutions obtained using two alternative methods extracted from the literature indicates that considerable cost reductions may be obtained.

The present study provides a multi-objective, multi-period, multi-product integrated sustainable-resilient mixed-integer linear programming model for the optimal design of second generation biofuel supply chain networks under uncertainty. A novel hybrid stochastic fuzzy-robust approach was utilized to tackle the uncertainty of parameters, and the weighted sum method was applied to deal with the multi-objective problem. Several resiliency measures are introduced to enhance the resiliency of the network and resist against any disruption. Furthermore, strategies to fulfill social impacts are proposed to promote sustainable development of the considered network. Then, a real case study is implemented to investigate the validation of the proposed model. The results indicated that simultaneously considering three measures, including resilience, social impacts, and cost and setting a trade-off between them by decision-makers can boost biofuel supply chain network design in an optimal manner.

It is characterized by their lack of instantaneous end-to-end paths, resulting in difficulties in designing effective DTN routing protocols. Traditional routing algorithms largely rely on greedy schemes. Such schemes can not guarantee the packets will be eventually transmitted to their destinations, thereby presenting a poor transmission efficiency. Recently, the social-based method has attracted a large amount of attention in wireless network routing. It can use the community and the centrality information to increase the delivery rate of the whole network. Therefore, in this article, we introduce the social-based mechanism to our DTN routing design. Besides, how the distributed nodes can learn the collaboration strategies is another challenge. Inspired by the recent success of multi-agent learning in online control, we adopt a centralized training and distributed execution learning paradigm and design a hierarchical social-based DTN architecture. Based on this, we propose a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (termed as QMIX) aided routing algorithm.

Cost optimal allocation of amplifiers and DCMs in WDM ring networks	OPTICS EXPRESS												Designing metropolitan wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) ring networks with minimum deployment cost is a demanding issue in Telecommunication Network planning. We have already presented amplifier placement methods to minimize the number of amplifiers in WDM rings for the case all amplifiers follow a unique gain model. In this paper, we take into account different types of amplifiers with predefined fixed characteristics and costs. We also formulate fiber dispersion limitations on the ring design, and present two efficient methods for placing amplifiers and Dispersion Compensation Modules (DCMs) in WDM rings to minimize the total deployment cost of the system. The first method deals with both linear and nonlinear equations and uses a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solver where the second method applies the linear approximation of nonlinear constraints, and uses a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver to minimize the total cost of the system. We carry out Simulation experiments to confirm the applicability of the methods and compare the results for various network configurations.

The increasing demand for Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs) able to collect and transmit data through wireless communication channels, while often positioned in locations that are difficult to access, is driving research into innovative solutions involving energy harvesting (EH) and wireless power transfer (WPT) to eventually allow battery-free sensor nodes. Due to the pervasiveness of radio frequency (RF) energy, RF EH and WPT are key technologies with the potential to power IoT devices and smart sensing architectures involving nodes that need to be wireless, maintenance free, and sufficiently low in cost to promote their use almost anywhere. This paper presents a state-of-the-art, ultra-low power 2.5 <mml:semantics>mu</mml:semantics>W highly integrated mixed signal system on chip (SoC), for multi-source energy harvesting and wireless power transfer. It introduces a novel architecture that integrates an ultra-low power intelligent power management, an RF to DC converter with very low power sensitivity and high power conversion efficiency (PCE), an Amplitude-Shift-Keying/Frequency-Shift-Keying (ASK/FSK) receiver and digital circuitry to achieve the advantage to cope, in a versatile way and with minimal use of external components, with the wide variety of energy sources and use cases. Diverse methods for powering Wireless Sensor Nodes through energy harvesting and wireless power transfer are implemented providing related system architectures and experimental results.

By actuator redundancies, a novel adaptive neural network (NN) event-triggered controller (ETC) design scheme is proposed based on the switching threshold event-triggering mechanism (SWT-ETM). To constrain the maximum overshoot and the convergence rate within given specifications, a prescribed performance function (PPF) error transformation is employed. It is shown that the tracking error will exponentially converge to an adjustable neighborhood of zero with prescribed transient performance, despite the presence of failures, system nonlinearities, parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Besides, the system's burden is significantly alleviated requiring less system resources for signal transmission and actuator execution to decrease the occurrence rate of the actuator failures; and the minimum inter-event interval is guaranteed to be positive to avoid the Zeno phenomenon. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive NN ETC scheme. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A key difference between the two approaches is that in the former the notion of time is virtual and is independent of real time, whereas the latter must execute in real time. Emulation gains realism while naturally foregoing complete repeatability; historically, emulation was also tedious to control and manage. We define integrated network experimentation as spatially combining real elements with simulated elements in the same experimental run, each modeling different portions of a network topology. Integrated experiments enable new validation techniques and larger experiments than obtainable by using real elements alone. This paper highlights the key issues in integrated network experimentation, and presents some of the design techniques we use in designing, building, and putting into public production use such an integrated environment, running on a space-shared cluster.

In such applications, the so-called Max-Min Fairness (MMF) solution concept is widely used. It is based on the worst service performance maximization with additional regularization by the lexicographic maximization of the second worst performance, the third one etc. The basic sequential procedure is applicable only for convex models, thus it allows to deal with basic design problems but fails if practical discrete restrictions commonly arriving in telecommunications network design are to be taken into account. We analyze alternative sequential approaches allowing to solve non-convex MMF network dimensioning problems. The directly defined sequential criteria can be introduced into the original model with some auxiliary variables and linear inequalities. The approaches guarantee the exact MMF solution for a complete set of criteria. However, they can be simplified by reducing the number of criteria thus generating effectively approximated MMF solutions.

As the nature of supplying the blood by the donors and also demand for the blood product are uncertain, a robust optimization approach is applied in the model to deal with this type of uncertainty. To convert the proposed multi objective model into a single objective one, the bounded objective function method is used. Then, as the presented mathematical model is a complicated mixed integer linear programming model, an algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation approach is proposed to solve the model. At the end, a computational study is done to present the competency of the proposed Lagrangian relaxation algorithm.

The missing phenomenon is assumed to occur, in the communication links for sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator, where the missing probability of packet dropouts is governed as two different mutually independent Bernoulli distributed white sequences with known conditional probability distributions. The main attention is focused on designing the robust fault detection filter (FDF) such that the estimation error between the residual and fault is minimized in an exponential way and at the same time the closed-loop networked switched system is exponentially stable in the mean-square sense. The simultaneous fault detection and controller design problem is converted into an exponential H-infinity filtering problem. By a multiple Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and the average dwell-time scheme, a novel delay-dependent sufficient conditions are developed to ensure the resulting error system is exponentially stable with an optimized H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. The solution of the parameters of the controllers and fault detection filters is characterized in terms of the feasibility of a convex optimization problem. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.																			1948-9439		978-1-5090-4657-7				2017							2109	2114																WOS:000427082204123

In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous NoC as an alternative to match performance and energy requirements for dedicated applications. By employing an optimized mix of different routers, a heterogeneous network optimized for latency and energy consumption is achieved. A dedicated data structure, the Application Communication Pattern (ACP), models the application, enabling the specification of the communication requirements among cores, together with their execution performance. ACP allows fast analysis, helping the system designer to evaluate the communication performance of a NoC-based system; this performance strongly depends on the placement of the cores, and it is computationally hard to find the optimal placement. An optimization algorithm mixes different router architectures - composing a heterogeneous NoC - and finds optimal placements for application cores. Therefore, a heterogeneous NoC can be achieved, which complies to the application requirements with minimum latency and energy, enabling one to obtain the Pareto curve relating latency and energy for a given application.

In every given design problem, the most appropriate structure is identified by solving three mathematical programming models (that is, one nonlinear program and two mixed-integer nonlinear programs) sequentially so as to satisfy different criteria in order of decreasing importance. Freshwater conservation is given the top priority in the present work because of its scarcity in environment and the pollution problems caused by wastewater effluents. Minimization of the total number of interconnections in the water network is treated as the next design goal since network complexity is directly related to operability, controllability and safety. The final step in the sequential procedure is to minimize the total throughput and, consequently, the operating and capital costs of all water using units as well. Five examples are presented in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed procedure. When compared with the network designs obtained with available methods reported in literature, it can be observed that better solutions can usually be generated with our approach.

The key challenges include (1) the dilemma of whether to explode the memory consumption due to the huge joint space or achieve sub-optimal designs, (2) the discrete nature of the accelerator design space that is coupled yet different from that of the networks and bitwidths, and (3) the chicken and egg problem associated with network-accelerator co-search, i.e., co-search requires operation-wise hardware cost, which is lacking during search as the optimal accelerator depending on the whole network is still unknown during search. To tackle these daunting challenges towards optimal and fast development of DNN accelerators, we propose a framework dubbed Auto-NBA to enable jointly searching for the Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators, by efficiently localizing the optimal design within the huge joint design space for each target dataset and acceleration specification. Our Auto-NBA integrates a heterogeneous sampling strategy to achieve unbiased search with constant memory consumption, and a novel joint-search pipeline equipped with a generic differentiable accelerator search engine. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that both Auto-NBA generated networks and accelerators consistently outperform state-of-the-art designs (including co-search/exploration techniques, hardware-aware NAS methods, and DNN accelerators), in terms of search time, task accuracy, and accelerator efficiency.

The key component in fulfilling the design is a broadband tunable power divider (TPD), whose power division ratio (PDR) can be theoretically tuned from -infinity to +infinity with a low reflection coefficient, and with good port to port isolation from 2.16 GHz to 2.64 GHz. The TPD is designed based on phase reconfigurable synthesized transmission lines (PRSTLs) as the tuning elements, in which the characteristic impedance is kept unaltered during phased tuning. In order to achieve continuous beam steering capability, two beam ports of the Butler matrix are excited with an appropriate weighting factor between signals, which is generated and controlled by the TPD. The average transmission loss of the feeding network is -3.5 dB and the average deviation of the progressive phase shift at the output ports is less than 20 degrees from 2.16 GHz to 2.64 GHz.																									2021																								WOS:001081957900027
J	Han, D				Han, Daeseok			Empirical evaluation of utility of anti-frost layer in pavement structure considering regional climate characteristics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING												Anti-frost layers in road pavement structures are widely applied to cold areas internationally. They mitigate cracks, potholes and roughness caused by the freeze-thaw phenomenon. Although the anti-frost layer design has been introduced to Korean road networks since the 1990s, its utility has not yet been empirically proven. This study attempts to evaluate the utility of the anti-frost layer with statistical methods using empirical data. As an analytical tool, the Bayesian Markov mixed hazard model for deterioration modelling and comparative analysis was introduced. In empirical studies, 8-year nation-wide network long-term pavement performance data (2316 sections) collected by the Korean Pavement Management System was applied. The analysis results signify that the anti-frost layer is good for prevention of cracks in network levels but is not enough for some cold areas with a freezing index of over 100. To secure the utility of anti-frost layers in the entire road network, it is necessary to revise the current Korean design standard.																			1029-8436	1477-268X				JUL 3	2022	23	8					2821	2828		10.1080/10298436.2021.1873327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10298436.2021.1873327		JAN 2021											WOS:000611603500001

A multi-echelon supply chain with multiple products and multiple time periods is considered and a Dynamic Mixed Integer Linear Programming (DMILP) model is developed that integrates' and optimizes various aspects of network design including supplier selection, location and size of production and distribution facilities, and quantity of flows along the supply chain, simultaneously. It is assumed that closing/reopening production plants and distribution centers is possible during the planning horizon. The objective is to maximize total cash value within the supply chain under a constrained budget. A three-stage solution procedure is developed based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and its efficiency is demonstrated through numerical experiments. The paper discusses specific considerations in optimizing supply chain networks with seasonal raw materials and highlights the benefits of the proposed modeling approach.

Actually, both disposable and reusable packaging containers are used. The former ends its life at the last stage of the distribution chain, the latter requires reverse flows to collect, recondition and, then, reuse it. Costs and emissions associated to the two types of packaging containers are different in nature, i.e. raw materials and landfill cost and emissions vs. reverse logistic costs and emissions, so that their choice is not univocal. Furthermore, such choice heavily affects the supply chain network structure and management. This paper addresses this topic aiming at designing a supply chain network including the packaging container best selection, storage/handling node location and flow allocation. An original bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model supports the decisional process. Despite the approach is general, a deep focus is on fresh fruit and vegetable distribution chain because of disposable and reusable packaging containers coexist in practice. The model looks at the cost and environmental impact minimisation over the whole network getting the Pareto frontier and supporting the logistic managers, industrial practitioners and policy makers in the network design and management. A real instance from Emilia-Romagna region, Italy, showcases the model application getting the economic and environmental optima together with best-balance configurations. Results stress the convenience of mixing reusable and disposable packaging containers to reach a global optimum. 47.1% reusable and 52.9% disposable is a possible good balance configuration reducing emissions while containing the cost increase.

A well-designed recycling network is a prerequisite of CDW recycling, which is favourable for improving the recycling rate. However, the lack of quantitative tools to measure the characteristics of the construction industry has a serious effect on the effective design of CDW recycling network. Extensive studies on reverse logistics network design over the past decades have provided a solid foundation for recycling network design. Thus, in this study, reverse logistics research is explored to determine possible solutions to the issue of CDW recycling network design. This study aims to provide a model for CDW treatment plants location planning and capacity expansion planning based on the reverse logistics research in the construction industry. In our model, the conflicts between the objectives of different stakeholders and the dynamic decision-making environment in the construction industry were considered. Then, a multiperiod multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model was developed to minimize the CDW disposal costs of contractors and to maximize the profits of recycling firms and recycling rate of CDW. Chongqing, China was selected as the case to validate the proposed model and derive managerial insights. Results show our model provides an efficient tool for CDW recycling network design.

However, the data transmission capacity of the networks is not being limited by the optical layer anymore. Nowadays, the electronic data processing capacity of the nodes, the so-called electronic bottleneck, is the most severe limitation to the traffic transmission rate growth of high-speed optical networks, due to the great development of the optical layer resources in the past years. This work presents a novel formulation to design virtual topologies of optical networks that minimizes the electronic data processing in the networks nodes, focusing the optimization objective on node congestion, (electronic data processing) instead of on lightpath congestion (optical data transmission). A comparison between the former congestion minimization formulation and the new one proposed in this work is done, analyzing the impact on congestion and the electronic data processing distribution among the network nodes. A significant reduction in the processing time of the proposed mixed-integer optimization problem is also reported.					Segatto, Marcelo E.

In a TWRN, there exists a challenging problem that the two cascading channels from User1-to-IRS-to-relay and User2-to-IRS-to-relay and two direct channels from User1-to-relay and User2-to-relay interfere with each other. Via smartly designing the initial phase shifts of IRS and pilot pattern, the two cascading channels are separated over only four pilot sequences by using simple arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. Then, the least-squares estimator is adopted to estimate the two cascading channels and two direct channels. The corresponding sum mean square errors (MSE) of channel estimators are derived. By minimizing Sum-MSE, the optimal phase shift matrix of IRS is proved. Then, two special matrices Hadamard and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix are shown to be two optimal training matrices for IRS. Furthermore, the IRS with discrete finite phase shifters is taken into account. The Hadamard matrix requires only one-bit phase shifters to achieve the optimal Sum-MSE performance for specific numbers of IRS elements. Using theoretical derivation and numerical simulations, we find that 3 or 4-bit phase shifters are sufficient for IRS to achieve a negligible MSE performance loss for any number.					zhao, lin/JPK-8436-2023; Liu, Yiwei/JUF-2477-2023; Zhang, Jinfan/JPK-7588-2023; Wang, Jiangzhou/GLS-3323-2022; FENG, X/JPL-4188-2023	Guan, Xinrong/0000-0002-9294-664X; Wang, Jiangzhou/0000-0003-0881-3594; shu, feng/0000-0003-0073-1965													0018-9545	1939-9359				APR	2023	72	4					5502	5507		10.1109/TVT.2022.3230423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2022.3230423													WOS:000975101300118

The corporations need to establish the reverse logistics network for SF6 recovery to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For managing SF6 waste and filling the research gap from theoretical and empirical research perspective in reverse logistics network design, we designed a comprehensive multi-layer reverse logistics network, including recycle points, recycle/distribution centers, and the SF6 treatment centers. The network was mathematically modeled as a biobjective and multi-layer fuzzy mixed-integer nonlinear programming model under return quantity uncertainty to minimize the total cost and maximize the comprehensive evaluation values of the SF6 treatment centers. With the cloud model, the method of fuzzy mathematical programming and the interactive non-inferior set estimation method, we obtained the optimal solution which determined transportation quantities of SF6 and the location of facilities. The proposed model was validated by a real world case study, which indicates that the emissions of SF6 will be reduced by 270.23 tons of gaseous SF6.																			2352-5398		978-94-6252-273-2				2016	75						38	42																WOS:000391653700009

The problem of computing a lifetime-optimal routing flow, link schedule, and link transmission powers is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem. We first restrict the link schedules to the class of interference-free time division multiple access (TDMA) schedules. In this special case we formulate the optimization problem as a mixed integer-convex program, which can be solved using standard techniques. For general non-orthogonal link schedules, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternates between adaptive link scheduling and computation of optimal link rates and transmission powers for a fixed link schedule. The performance of this algorithm is compared to other design approaches for several network topologies. The results illustrate the advantages of load balancing, multihop routing, frequency reuse, and interference mitigation in increasing the lifetime of energy-constrained networks. We also describe a partially distributed algorithm to compute optimal rates and transmission powers for a given link schedule.

By introducing an event generator in the control loop, the model of event triggered master-slave synchronization frame is constructed. Considering the effect of the communication network including transmission delay and stochastic fluctuation, an event-triggered error system of master system and slave system is formulated. By using the Lyapunov functional method, some delay-dependent synchronization criteria in terms of linear matrix inequality are proposed to ensure the mean square synchronization between the master system and the slave system. A singular value decomposition lemma is introduced to solve the control design problem for the case of the lower bound of neuron activation function is nonzero, which is different from the previous literature.

In order to strengthen the health system response to such crisis, especially in low- to middle-income communities, this paper extends a novel multi-objective model for designing a health service network under uncertainty which simultaneously considers efficiency, social responsibility, and network cost. For efficiency, a modified data envelopment analysis model is introduced and inserted into the proposed model to decrease the inefficiency of healthcare facilities belonging to the different tiers of the health system. For social responsibility, two measures of job creation and balanced development are incorporated into the extended model. This is not only considered to cope with the increased numbers of patients and disaster victims to healthcare facilities but also to deal with the challenge of the economy and the livelihoods of people during the crisis. Moreover, a novel mixed possibilistic-flexible robust programming (MPFRP) approach is developed to protect the considered network against uncertainty. To show the applicability of the extended model, a real-world case study is presented. The results reveal that contrary to fuzzy programming models, the MPFRP performs well in terms of social responsibility (72%), cost (8%), and efficiency (28%) and is able to make a trade-off between these three measures. In this study, the resilience level of the designed network is not addressed while disregarding any short-term stoppage owing to internal or external sources of disruption in designing may bring about a considerable loss.

Deploying multiple radios, say two, at each node will improve the performance of wireless access, but this will also increase the cost and power consumption of the solution. However, deploying multiple radios at only a few nodes, especially those that are overloaded with traffic, can lead to a less-costly and less-power-hungry solution, possibly without sacrificing performance. Hence, we propose a mixed-capacity wireless access (MCWA) architecture for WOBAN and study how to optimally place a limited number of additional radios at the wireless nodes to save the overall network cost. We formulate this problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and solve it using a standard solver such as CPLEX. An efficient channel and radio assignment scheme is essential to utilize MCWA by reducing interference and contention in the wireless front-end of WOBAN. We propose an intelligent channel and radio assignment (ICRA) for MCWA in WOBAN that performs load balancing over different channels to reduce interference and contention. We formulate this problem as another MILP and solve it using CPLEX. Our findings show that, by using a mixed-capacity wireless access design with intelligent channel and radio assignment, we can obtain almost the same performance as a WOBAN with multi-radios at all nodes.

One major obstacle to optimizing ecological function has been quantifying and characterizing a complex ecosystem structure. Here, the structure and functions of six types of land-use restoration were investigated in the hilly-gully region of the Loess Plateau, China. In total, 44 ecological factors from canopy, understory and soil were determined. We constructed the related network of reforestation ecosystems, quantified the structure of ecosystem through network topology, and explored the relationships between structure and functions. The results showed that changes in plantation type altered the network hubs, but some nodes, such as species height, breast-height diameter and understory biomass, were often keystone hubs. Mixed plantations enhanced the connectivity among different modules. In addition, we found that closeness of network connectivity was an important factor influencing ecological functions, while soil erodibility was the main limiting factor for reforestation ecosystem structure in this region. Moreover, mixed plantations tended to have more balanced topological metrics and ecological functions. Overall, this study suggests that mixed plantations or monoculture plantations should be designed according to the characteristics and ecological demands of the regional ecological environment. Although monoculture plantations may support local ecosystems, mixed plantations offer more resilience to a landscape because they were help to achieve a balance among the ecological functions.

To be able to handle very large networks the options are: very fast computers with large memories, parallel simulation techniques exploiting multiprocessor computers and, parallel simulation on networks of workstations.

In this survey paper, we aim to review the particle filtering method and its applications in networked systems. We first provide an overview of the particle filtering methods as well as networked systems, and then investigate the recent progress in the design of particle filter for networked systems. Our main focus is on the state estimation problems in this survey, but other aspects of particle filtering approaches are also highlighted.

This article's objective is designing an efficient algorithm to choose suitable nodes to be pinning controlled for PBNs with time delays. By using the semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices, a PBN with time delays can be converted into a discrete-time linear system, and the transition matrix also can be obtained. Then, the necessary and sufficient conditions in the form of algebraic expression are given for the existence and solvability of the pinning feedback controllers with minimum pinning nodes for PBNs with time delays. Besides, three algorithms are proposed for designing and solving minimum pinning controllers.

However, it is different in practice and customers just receive the profit sharing services through this massive financial network. The main cause of such a problem in Iranian banking network is the lack of an appropriate purchase intention model for partnership facility consistent with Islamic banking and ethics. Therefore, given the importance of this subject, this research aims to classify and model the factors affecting the purchase intention of partnership facility in the banking network using the qualitative research method and data-based strategy. In this regard, ten top managers of Bank Saderat Iran were interviewed and forty-two concepts were identified based on three coding stages, known as open, selective, and axial coding These concepts were classified in twelve groups: intra-organizational factors, macro environmental factors, service quality, price mix, people mix, product mix, promotion mix, process mix, research and development, customer-related factors, the bank's brand, and marketing philosophy.																			2322-4894	2538-6271				SUM-FAL	2020	9	18					321	341		10.22034/ri.2021.117016.1218	http://dx.doi.org/10.22034/ri.2021.117016.1218													WOS:000664628700011

The control algorithm is defined in the discrete domain appropriate for dedicated VLSI implementation and direct processing of discrete sensory data, such as obtained from a CCD camera. The control law is based on the principle of virtual farce fields. The virtual forces (repulsive and circulation vectors) guiding the robot in the vicinity of obstacles are derived from the gradient fields associated with discrete representation of visual information. Discretization and computational tasks are assigned to parallel neuromorphic processors, which emulate the gradient operations. The particularities of discrete geometrical representations of the world and the adjustable control parameters essential for flexible and robust controller operation are discussed in detail. Finally, a detailed scheme of a tunable navigation controller specifying the parameters generated internally by the network and those that have to be provided from an external source (e.g., the operator, or a supervisory knowledge-based controller) is provided.																			0921-0296	1573-0409				OCT-DEC	1998	23	2-4					129	146		10.1023/A:1008070512860	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008070512860													WOS:000077318300003

The mismatched external disturbances make it impossible to transform the original model into the multiple-step-ahead predictor model by using the existing predictor technology. To tackle such a challenge, a novel backstepping-based disturbance compensation control framework is firstly proposed for the discrete-time SPMSM with known system dynamics. In the proposed framework, the disturbance observer is designed to compensate for the external disturbances, and the novel variable substitution/decoupling technology is proposed to design the event-based controller for the original controlled system. The proposed controller is composed of the event-based feedback control signal and the feedforward disturbance compensation signal, thereby improving the system disturbance rejection ability and mitigating the communication resource. Subsequently, an event-based adaptive neural control scheme is proposed by combining a modified neural disturbance observer. The proposed scheme ensures that the tracking error converges to a small neighbourhood of the origin, all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and meanwhile the communication resources are greatly reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated through the simulation results.

The proposed model formulation allows us to consider various static and dynamic time-scheduling protocols, in-network processing implementations and encompasses sampled-data systems as a particular case. Provided that the continuous-time observer is robust to measurement errors (in an appropriate sense) we derive bounds on the maximum allowable transmission interval (MATI) that ensure the convergence of observation errors under network-induced communication constraints. The stability analysis is trajectory-based and utilizes small-gain arguments. It has to be emphasized that this paper also furnishes new tools for the observer design for sampled-data systems. Various observers can be combined and used within our approach to obtain estimators for NCS.					; Nesic, Dragan/O-2609-2013	Postoyan, Romain/0000-0002-2454-602X; Nesic, Dragan/0000-0001-7944-0241													0743-1619		978-1-4244-7427-1				2010							3678	3683																WOS:000287187904012

EV energy consumption will also become an essential issue for regional energy providers who will need to adapt to the additional electricity demand created by EVs. This study presents research to facilitate planning for EVs by incorporating travelers' behavior and energy consumption into the evaluation process by introducing a novel framework for the network design problem (NDP) which employs a previously introduced constrained shortest path algorithm that accounts for the distance limitations imposed on EV drivers. For certain design scenarios, the total travel time and total energy consumption are shown to be conflicting objectives. In addition, a new equity issue that arises in networks comprised of mixed classes of vehicles is explored. Results illustrate that a given design scenario can impact vehicle user groups differently.

J	Walkenstrom, P; Hermansson, AM				Walkenstrom, P; Hermansson, AM			Effects of shear on pure and mixed gels of gelatin and particulate whey protein	FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS												Microstructural and rheological effects of shear on pure whey protein (WPC) gels and on mixed gels of gelatin and WPC have been investigated at pH 5.4. The shear was performed just before the gel formation of the WPC, using shear rates of up to 300/s for times of up to 600 s. The microstructure was investigated by light microscopy (LM) and quantified by image analysis. The behaviour of the storage modulus (G') upon shear was analysed according to fully factorial experimental designs, where the shear rate and time were used as design variables. Pure WPC suspensions, sheared at similar to 2/s for similar to 20 s, formed gels which showed an extremum in G'. In the vicinity of the extremum, the G' showed a value twice that for a gel formed from an unsheared suspension. Image analysis on LM micrographs at different magnifications revealed that an inhomogeneous WPC network was formed from the suspensions sheared at similar to 2/s for similar to 20 s. Heavily sheared WPC suspensions (92/s for 240 s) formed gels which showed a weaker G' than the gels formed from unsheared suspensions. The behaviour of G' of mixed gels upon shear was similar to that of the pure WPC gels. The G' for the mixed gels proved to be less sensitive to variations in the shear conditions than the pure WPC gels. During cooling after the gel point of both pure and mixed gels, the loss modulus (G') showed a pronounced peak for samples sheared in the vicinity of the extremum. Mixed suspensions sheared in the vicinity of the extremum formed inhomogeneous WPC networks with large domains of gelatin. The mean pore size of the WPC network, estimated by image analysis, increased from 40 000 mu m(3), for the unsheared mixed sample, to 120 000 mu m(3) for the sheared mixed sample. Results from image analysis at different magnifications further confirmed that suspensions sheared in the vicinity of the extremum formed an inhomogeneous WPC network. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The optimized objective value and specific paths are calculated with different variable parameters, and the air-rail network of China's fourteen cities is constructed. The result shows the close relationship among the minimum total transportation cost, the number of specific paths, number of hubs-m and the discount factor-rho. The bigger the value of m and the smaller the value of rho, then the smaller total transportation cost and the more specific paths; vice versa.																					978-1-60595-351-9				2016							145	154																WOS:000389768500024

Motivated by time-scale decomposition, the states are decomposed into slow dynamics of velocity, altitude and fast dynamics of attitude angles. By command transformation, the reference command for gamma-theta (p) -q subsystem is derived from h-gamma subsystem. Furthermore, to simplify the backstepping design, we propose the controller for gamma-theta (p) -q subsystem from prediction function without virtual controller. For the velocity subsystem, the throttle setting constraint is considered and new NN adaption law is designed by auxiliary error dynamics.

These design factors have been confronted, solutions offered and a comprehensive, reliable and accurate system to wirelessly monitor EEG signals in real-time has been developed. As wireless technology is advancing, the design and development of a more reliable and portable health care system is possible. In this paper we propose an efficient wireless sensor network for remote monitoring of patients with neurological disorders that can provide a basic health service to rural areas. As a result, infirm patients will no longer need to travel long distances regularly to reach the nearest healthcare center. Bioelectric signals are often affected by an excessive level of interference, mainly from power supply. In this paper various interference reduction techniques for analog front-end design are considered. Power consumption is another important design challenge for the continuous monitoring. Thus an efficient power reduction technique is considered in the proposed design of a wireless sensor network with reduced interference and optimized power.																			2162-7665						2012																								WOS:000320608600228

The ET mechanism with fixed triggering threshold is designed to decide whether the current control signal should be transmitted to the actuator. A systematic framework is developed to construct a novel adaptive neural controller by directly applying the backstepping procedure to the underlying system. The proposed framework overcomes the noncausality problem, avoids the possible controller-related singularity problem, and gets rid of the neural approximation of the virtual control laws. Under the ET mechanism, the corresponding ET-based actuator is put forward by introducing an ET threshold compensation operator. Such a compensation operator (with an adjustable design parameter) is subtly designed based on a hyperbolic tangent function and a sign function. The threshold compensation error is analytically characterized in terms of a time-varying parameter, and the error bound is shown to be relatively small that is dependent on the adjustable design parameter. Compared with the traditional ET-based actuator without the compensation operator, the proposed ET-based actuator exhibits several distinguished features including: 1) improvement of the tracking accuracy (especially at the triggering instants); 2) further mitigation of the communication load; and 3) enlargement of the allowable range of the ET threshold. These features are illustrated by numerical and practical examples.

J	Sun, HJ; Wu, JJ; Wang, W; Gao, ZY				Sun, Huijun; Wu, Jianjun; Wang, Wei; Gao, Ziyou			Reliability-based traffic network design with advanced traveler information systems	INFORMATION SCIENCES												As the demands on urban transportation networks grow rapidly, problems of network design have attracted a great deal of interest because of the need to effectively handle urban transport planning using information technology. A bi-level continuous network design model is proposed in this paper to address the optimal road capacity expansion of existing links. Based on the fact that every origin-destination demand is random and affected by traffic travel information, the network is subject to relatively minimal dayto-day events of stochastic link capacity variations. Therefore, the primary objective is to maximize the reliability of the total travel time, while the lower level model, utilizing the behaviors of stochastic route choice, is aimed at reducing drivers' travel time uncertainty through traffic information provided by advanced traveler information systems. The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to solve the suggested model, and a numerical example using the Sioux Falls network is provided. The computation results show that travel time reliability is improved by system optimization using traffic information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Ma, QL; Fan, Z; Wang, CZ; Tan, HY				Ma, Qianli; Fan, Zheng; Wang, Chenzhi; Tan, Hongye			Graph Mixed Random Network Based on PageRank	SYMMETRY-BASEL												In recent years, graph neural network algorithm (GNN) for graph semi-supervised classification has made great progress. However, in the task of node classification, the neighborhood size is often difficult to expand. The propagation of nodes always only considers the nearest neighbor nodes. Some algorithms usually approximately classify by message passing between direct (single-hop) neighbors. This paper proposes a simple and effective method, named Graph Mixed Random Network Based on PageRank (PMRGNN) to solve the above problems. In PMRGNN, we design a PageRank-based random propagation strategy for data augmentation. Then, two feature extractors are used in combination to supplement the mutual information between features. Finally, a graph regularization term is designed, which can find more useful information for classification results from neighbor nodes to improve the performance of the model. Experimental results on graph benchmark datasets show that the method of this paper outperforms several recently proposed GNN baselines on the semi-supervised node classification. In the research of over-smoothing and generalization, PMRGNN always maintains better performance. In classification visualization, it is more intuitive than other classification methods.

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) With Multiple Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS												In this paper, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks assisted by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) with discrete phase shifts are investigated, in which each user device (UD) is served by an IRS to improve the quality of the received signal. Two scenarios are considered according to whether there is a direct link between the base station (BS) and each UD, and the outage performance is analyzed for each of them. Specifically, the asymptotic expressions for the upper and lower bounds of the outage probability in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are derived. Following that, the diversity order is obtained. It is shown that the use of discrete phase shifts does not degrade diversity order. More importantly, simulation results reveal that a 3-bit resolution for discrete phase shifts is sufficient to achieve near-optimal outage performance. Simulation results also imply the superiority of IRSs over full-duplex decode-and-forward relays.

J	Tang, XY; Mouthaan, K				Tang, Xinyi; Mouthaan, Koen			Design of Large Bandwidth Phase Shifters Using Common Mode All-Pass Networks	IEEE MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS COMPONENTS LETTERS												The design of digital phase shifters with bandwidths from 2:1 up to 20:1 using common mode all-pass networks (APNs) is presented. Because of the inherently large return loss value of the APNs, the phase shift response is not affected by the return loss and therefore the phase shift can be treated separately. The common mode APNs enable the use of standard switches and low cost fabrication. By properly designing the common mode APN phase shifter, an equal ripple phase shift response over a very large bandwidth can be realized. As an example, a 3 b 360 degrees phase shifter covering a bandwidth of one decade (10:1) is designed using discrete components on PCB. An RMS phase error less than 10 degrees, a return loss larger than 10 dB, and an amplitude imbalance less than 1.5 dB are measured from 100 MHz to 940 MHz.

Incremental design of water symbiosis networks with prior knowledge: The case of an industrial park in Kenya	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Industrial parks have a high potential for recycling and reusing resources such as water across companies by creating symbiosis networks. In this study, we introduce a mathematical optimization framework for the design of water network integration in industrial parks formulated as a large-scale standard mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. The novelty of our approach relies on i) developing a multi-level incremental optimization framework for water network synthesis, ii) including prior knowledge of water demand growth and projected water scarcity to evaluate the significance of water-saving solutions, iii) incorporating a comprehensive formulation of the water network synthesis problem including multiple pollutants and different treatment units and iv) performing a multi-objective optimization of the network including freshwater savings and relative cost of the network. The significance of the proposed optimization framework is illustrated by applying it to an existing industrial park in a water-scarce region in Kenya. Firstly, we illustrated the benefits of including prior knowledge to prevent an over-design of the network at the early stages. In the case study, we achieved a more flexible and expandable water network with 36% lower unit cost at the early stage and 15% lower unit cost at later stages for overall maximum freshwater savings of 25%. Secondly, multi-objective analysis suggests an optimum freshwater savings of 14% to reduce the unit cost of the network by half. Moreover, the significance of symbiosis networks is highlighted by showing that intra-company connections can only achieve a maximum freshwater savings of 17% with significantly higher unit cost (+45%). Finally, we showed that the values of symbiosis connectivity index in the Pareto front correspond to higher freshwater savings, indicating the significant role of the symbiosis network in the industrial park under study. This is the first study, where all the above elements have been taken into account simultaneously for the design of a water reuse network. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On the flip side, they are difficult to train to solve specific problems. One approach to training is to train conventional neural networks with binary threshold activation functions, which may then be implemented with spikes. This is a powerful approach. However, when applied to neural networks with convolutional kernels, the spiking networks explode in size. In this work, we design multiple spiking computational modules, which reduce the size of the networks back to size of the conventional networks. They do so by taking advantage of the temporal nature of spiking neural networks. We evaluate the size reduction analytically and on classification examples. Finally, we compare and confirm the classification accuracy of their implementation on a discrete threshold neuroprocessor.																					978-0-7381-4337-8				2020							116	125		10.1109/ICRC2020.2020.00010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICRC2020.2020.00010													WOS:000656500700016

In this paper, an efficient scene text detection scheme is proposed based on the Progressive Scale Expansion Network (PSENet). A Mixed Pooling Module (MPM) is designed to effectively capture the dependence of text information at different distances, where different pooling operations are employed to better extract information of text shape. The backbone network is optimized by combining two extensions of the Residual Network (ResNet), i.e., ResNeXt and Res2Net, to enhance feature extraction effectiveness. Experimental results show that the precision of our scheme is improved more than by 5% compared with the original PSENet.																			1687-6180					OCT 16	2021	2021	1							97	10.1186/s13634-021-00808-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13634-021-00808-5													WOS:000707703700001

Therefore, the TDAC is more compact than a conventional DAC consisting of many current sources and resistors. Moreover, a TDAC with leak resistance reproduces biologically plausible synaptic responses expressed as alpha functions or dual exponential equations. We also present numerical analysis results for a TDAC and circuit simulation results for a circuit designed using the TSMC 40 nm CMOS process.																			0278-081X	1531-5878				JUN	2021	40	6					2763	2781		10.1007/s00034-020-01597-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00034-020-01597-2		DEC 2020											WOS:000597435000001

Those traditional, basic models are formulated as mixed integer linear programs (MILP-model) and determine which facilities to open that minimize the investment, processing, transportation, disposal and penalty costs while supply, demand and capacity constraints are satisfied. However, we show that they can be improved when they are combined with a queueing model because it enables to account for (1) some dynamic aspects like lead time and inventory positions, and (2) the higher degree of uncertainty inherent to reverse logistics. Since this extension introduces nonlinear relationships, the problem is defined as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP-model). Due to this additional complexity, the MINLP-model is presented for a single product-single-level network. Several examples are solved with a genetic algorithm based on the technique of differential evolution.

This variant arises in a city logistics environment, more specifically in a long-haul passenger transport system that is also used to transport urban freight. We propose two mixed integer programming models for two objective functions: minimization of network operational costs and minimization of travel times. Since the problems under study are NP-hard, we propose three size reduction heuristics. In order to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms, we carried out computational experiments on a set of synthetic problem instances. We use the relative percentage deviation as performance criterion. For the cost objective function, a LP-and-Fix algorithm outperforms other methods in most tested instances, but for the travel time, a hybrid method (size reduction with LP-and-Fix algorithm) is, in general, better than other approaches.

J	Fernandes, LJ; Relvas, S; Barbosa-Póvoa, AP				Fernandes, Leao Jose; Relvas, Susana; Barbosa-Povoa, Ana Paula			Strategic network design of downstream petroleum supply chains: Single versus multi-entity participation	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN												The petroleum supply chain (PSC) is a highly competitive system that motivates complex studies for decisions involving different problems such as the redesign aimed at optimizing existing distribution networks. This paper considers a multi-entity, multi-echelon, multi-product and multi-transportation downstream PSC network with shared installations, resource capacities, supply sources and demand requirements. A deterministic mixed integer linear program (MILP) is developed for strategic design and planning of the downstream PSC network that determines optimal depot locations, capacities, transportation modes, routes and network affectations for long term planning. The MILP maximizes the multi-echelon total profits for the petroleum companies along the supply, refining, distribution and retail stages. A multi-entity PSC network is considered, involving companies' financial participation in refineries, transportation and storage depots. The MILP is tested with the real-case Portuguese PSC network involving production at local refineries and supply from a regional hub. Uni-entity networks as well as multi-entity networks with competitive or individualistic operation are modeled, presenting the current, grassroots and retrofit designs.

However, such mobile devices have inherent resource constraints: low network bandwidth, small screen size, limited input methods and low commitment viewing. Therefore, a mobile platform requires systems and applications for information display and access to mitigate these various constraints and further complicates their design. To facilitate access to news video on mobile devices, a coordinated design approach is taken, considering various system perspectives. The goal is to provide a cognitively palatable stream of videos and a seamless and low latency user experience through the use of an adaptive mixed-initiative interface to solicit user relevance feedback, and content retrieval integrated with client-side content aware prefetching. These various components are otherwise usually considered independently in the system design. The experiments suggest that this approach is helpful for recommending news video content on a mobile device, and areas for future investigation are outlined. The contributions of this paper are: (1) a mixed-initiative user interface design for small devices integrated with a content recommendation strategy that harnesses user relevance feedback; (2) coupled with the design and implementation of a content-aware prefetching scheme for videos, using the above mentioned feedback to lower the user perceived latency on the client-end; and (3) overall coordinated system design, with a quantitative evaluation of the tradeoffs between bandwidth, semantic relevance and user perceived latency.

In this framework, a new superstructure combining both networks is developed by attempting to consider all possible options with respect to the topology of the process and water networks, leading to Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) problem. A solution strategy to solve the multi-network problem accounts explicitly the interactions between the networks by selecting suitable technologies in order to transform raw materials into products and produce clean water to be reused in the process at the early stage of design. Since the connection between the process network and the wastewater treatment network is not a straight forward connection, a new converter interval is introduced in order to convert the values of contaminants in the wastewater stream into wastewater characterizations. The systematic approach is used to manage the complexity of the problem by solving simultaneously process synthesis and water synthesis network problems with respect to environment, economics and sustainability. The applicability of the systematic approach is demonstrated using a conceptual case study to test the features of the solution approach under different scenarios depending on the design-synthesis problem.

It is assumed that the possible risks associated with transport lead times follow a normal distribution with defined mean and standard deviation. The model is tested with different levels of risk to achieve maximum satisfaction in the network. By considering acceptable levels of satisfaction, the results of the analysis of the proposed model will provide different scenarios, which will help decision makers better understand the supply chain network required for the design.

J	Rao, HX; Xu, Y; Zhang, B; Yao, DY				Rao, Hong-Xia; Xu, Yong; Zhang, Bin; Yao, Deyin			Robust estimator design for periodic neural networks with polytopic uncertain weight matrices and randomly occurred sensor nonlinearities	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS												This work addresses the problem of the estimator design for the periodic neural networks with polytopic uncertain connection weight matrices. The polytopic uncertainty is used to model the uncertain weight matrices. Bernoulli processes are employed to characterise the randomly occurred sensor nonlinearities, where the sensors are distributed in a large area. A Lyapunov function which depends both on the polytopic vertices and the period is constructed to improve the performance of the estimator. Sufficient conditions of the stochastic stability with H performance for the augmented system are established, and the corresponding gains of the estimator are designed. Finally, an illustrative numerical example is given.																			1751-8644	1751-8652				JUN 12	2018	12	9					1299	1305		10.1049/iet-cta.2017.1163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2017.1163													WOS:000437311900014

Sustainable reverse logistics network design for household plastic waste	FLEXIBLE SERVICES AND MANUFACTURING JOURNAL												Plastic recycling is a legal requirement and can yield environmental benefits. In the Netherlands, there is a complex network of various collection methods, separation centers, sorting centers and reprocessors. The first step of the recycling system, separating plastics from other waste, can occur within households (source-separation) or in separation centers (post-separation), making a difference in collection channel choice and technology requirements. The purpose of this paper is to provide decision support on choosing the most suitable combination of separation methods in the Netherlands. Decision support is given through optimized reverse logistics network design which makes the overall recycling system more efficient and sustainable, while taking into account the interests of various stakeholders (municipalities, households, etc.). A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which minimizes both transportation cost and environmental impact, is used in this network design. The research follows the approach of scenario study; the baseline scenario is the current situation and other scenarios are designed with various strategic alternatives. Modeling is conducted by using a graphical optimization tool IBM LogicNet Plus 7.1. Comparing these scenarios, the results show that the current network settings of the baseline situation is efficient in logistics terms but has a potential to adapt to strategic changes, depending on the assumptions regarding availability of the required processing facilities to treat plastic waste. In some of the tested scenarios, a separate collection channel for Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles is cost efficient and saves carbon emission. Although the figures differ depending on the separation method choices of municipalities, our modeling result of all the tested scenarios shows a saving of more than 25 % carbon emission compared to the current network.

We model the problem as a two-stage stochastic program with discrete first-stage (investment) variables. Two formulations of the problem are used. The first one with general integer investment variables and the second one, a variant of the first model, with 0-1 investment variables. We present computational results for three solution approaches: the integer L-shaped (Benders) decomposition, a branch and bound framework and a disjunctive cutting plane method.

A key issue in the area is how to devise reasonable packet-switching network design methodologies that allow the choice of the most adequate set of network resources for the delivery of a given mix of services with the desired level of end-to-end Quality of Service (e2e QoS) and, at the same time, consider the traffic dynamics of today's packet-switching networks. In this paper, we focus on problems that arise when dealing with this subject, namely Buffer Assignment (BA), Capacity Assignment (CA), Flow and Capacity Assignment (FCA), Topology, Flow and Capacity Assignment (TCFA) problems. Our proposed approach maps the end-user's performance constraints into transport-layer performance constraints first, and then into network-layer performance constraints. This mapping is then considered together with a refined TCP/IP traffic modeling technique, that is both simple and capable of producing accurate performance estimates, for general-topology packet-switching design networks subject to realistic traffic patterns. Sub-problems are derived from a general design problem and a collection of heuristic algorithms are introduced for compute approximate solutions. We illustrate examples of network planning/dimensioning considering Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Baldvinsson, I; Nakata, T				Baldvinsson, Ivar; Nakata, Toshihiko			Cost Assessment of a District Heating System in Northern Japan Using a Geographic Information-Based Mixed Integer Linear Programming Model	JOURNAL OF ENERGY ENGINEERING												This paper presents a geographic information-based mixed integer linear programming model for a district heating system design. The model minimizes the annualized investment and operation costs of the system, with the key results showing the optimal distribution network structure and optimal capacity and dispatch of heat plants. A network topology of nodes and edges, providing accurate geographic representation of the district, is generated using a geographic information system and acts as a constraint. A case study is conducted for a district in Hirosaki city, located in the northernmost prefecture of mainland Japan. The results demonstrate the considerable economic benefits of integrating locally available woodchips in heat-only boilers instead of using city gas due to lower fuel costs. Low temperature operation reduces the fuel costs due to less network heat loss compared to medium temperature operation, but it is overcome by the cost of the larger pipe size and the pumping power. Implementation of the district heating system to the case area encourages sustainable development through economic favorability, decreased primary energy consumption, and considerable CO2 emissions reduction, compared to the current heat supply structure.

C	Wang, T; Xu, H; Liu, FM			ACM	Wang, Tao; Xu, Hong; Liu, Fangming			Aemon: Information-agnostic Mix-flow Scheduling in Data Center Networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ASIA-PACIFIC WORKSHOP ON NETWORKING (APNET '17)					1st Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking (APNET)	AUG 03-04, 2017	Hong Kong, HONG KONG	Assoc Comp Machinery				Data center networks carry a mix of flows, some with deadlines and some without. Existing mix-flow transport designs assume prior knowledge of flow sizes, which may not hold in practice. Without such information, mix-flow scheduling becomes particularly challenging due to (1) the lack of precise rate control of deadline flows with minimal impact on non-deadline flows; (2) difficulty in assigning priority to both two types of flows. We present Aemon, an information-agnostic mix-flow transport. Aemon relies on a new congestion control mechanism based on urgency-the ratio between the elapsed transmission time and the remaining time to deadline-to strategically modulate the sending rate of deadline flows. In addition, Aemon uses a novel two-level priority scheduling policy to differentiate mix flows. As time goes, a deadline flow's priority level increases as its urgency rises, and a non-deadline flow's priority level decreases as it sends more bytes similar to PIAS to approximate Shortest-Job-First policy. While in the same priority level, non-deadline flows take precedence to avoid possible starvation caused by aggressive deadline flows. Extensive simulations on ns-2 show that Aemon outperforms existing information-agnostic schemes and is only slightly worse than state-of-the-art Karuna.					wang, tao/HLG-5649-2023	Xu, Hong/0000-0002-9359-9571															978-1-4503-5244-4				2017							106	112		10.1145/3106989.3106992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3106989.3106992													WOS:000614068500016

Under a lower triangular linear growth condition, when only the output is measurable, a sampled-data output feedback network controller, whose observer and control law are both linear, is constructed to solve the stabilization problem. Using a feedback domination design approach which substantially differs from the separation principle, we explicitly construct a Lyapunov-Krasovskill functional to prove the global asymptotic stability with the help of inductive proof method. The control law is discrete-time and linear, hence simulation examples be easily implemented with computers to show the effectiveness of our proposed method.																			1026-0226	1607-887X				DEC 20	2019	2019								4706846	10.1155/2019/4706846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/4706846													WOS:000522147600001
